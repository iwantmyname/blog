putting their feet up over the holiday weekend, eating good food and 
spending lots of leisure time with friends and family. It's also a time 
when online retailers get busy offering a wide range of fantastic deals 
to lure customers away from their turkey and cranberry sauce. So to get 
into the Thanksgiving spirit, we sniffed out a fantastic offer for you
