Many of you will be aware that [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) is based in New Zealand, which is the location for filming of both the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and now The Hobbit. In fact Oscar winning director Peter Jackson shot much of the movie footage on a huge sound stage just a few minutes drive from our office in downtown Wellington. 

The movie maker also employs a large CGI and special effects team nearby who additionally delivered the amazing digital effects for other movies such as King Kong, Tintin and Avatar. We are incredibly fortunate to be immersed in such a creative environment focusing both artistic talent and high technology on delivering a world class product to millions of fans globally. Some of the [iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.com/about)
 even had roles as extras during the making of The Hobbit and we have 
many friends employed in software development and tech support within 
the film industry. It's within that context that we ourselves are driven to build and deliver the most innovative and cool domain registrar technology on the planet. 

With the worldwide premiere of [The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey](http://www.thehobbit.com/) happening on our front doorstep this week, the city is buzzing with excitement and has transformed into "the middle of Middle Earth" as the stars arrive for their much anticipated walk down the red carpet. There's also been some odd and fantastical characters spotted entertaining fans around town in the lead up to the big event. I even had a very close encounter myself with a rather hungry and scary looking Orc (see photo).

Did you know you can have your own [Middle Earth domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro)? We offer .ME domains that double nicely as your Middle Earth address on the web. To celebrate Hobbit week, the Orcs have been busy chopping and slashing our domain prices. So we are offering [discounted .ME domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) for only $14.90 until December 1st. If you are a Hobbit fan, get [blogging](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/) all about it or set up a [domain customized photo portfolio site](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/) in time for the movie launch.
