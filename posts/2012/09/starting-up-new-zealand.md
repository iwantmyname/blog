Over the last couple of years at [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) we've loved playing a part in starting up Startup Weekend across New Zealand. We've provided technical and business mentorship, organiser team management resources, [prizes and cash sponsorship](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/wonderful-wellington-startup-w.html) - not to mention given away loads of free [domain names](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains). 

Judges at the recent [Tauranga Startup Weekend](http://tauranga.startupweekend.org/) reported that the final presentations were of the highest standard ever. That's a testament to all of the organisers, mentors, sponsors and participants who collaborate to bring each event to life. I'm sure we haven't seen the last of Sheldon Nesdale, Rowan Yeoman and the team, who did a fantastic job bringing it all together this time.

This weekend was my fourth, but it was actually my first as a player (that's our team pictured). It sure provided a whole new perspective and reminded me that start-up entrepreneurs need a sturdy emotional foundation to succeed. Expect to encounter inspiration, joy, anger, frustration and elation on your Startup Weekend roller-coaster. It's like a microcosm of a real life business.

But now that we've all returned to planet Earth, I want to thank the talented team who took that short space flight with me. Peter, mission control - you kept us on track and bravely took on the challenge of presenting. Kristy, your marketing and design skills were heaven sent. Joshua, the gentle giant who rightly insisted on a design-centric focus, keep aiming for the stars! Bjorn, our engineering officer, thanks for being a techie sounding board and putting me in my place when it was needed. Nigel, our loyal foot soldier and ideas enthusiast (you were joking about the urinal ads, right?). Thank-you one and all.

Every event has it's own flavour. Tourism and recreation figured prominently in the discussions at Tauranga. [Standby](http://tauranga.startupweekend.org/2012/09/19/in-the-media-bay-of-plenty-times-article-about-the-winning-startup-at-tauranga-startup-weekend-2012/) was the (rightful) winning team on the night with an idea that may actually save lives on the water. [MessageTap](http://archived.link/http://messagetap.me/), appropriately, got the award for "most studious" team. But, if just one person goes on to start a future business or share an idea or kick off a social venture having been inspired by this weekend, then we have all succeeded. New Zealand needs this!
