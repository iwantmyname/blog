This week at the [Digital Earth Summit](http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/) we've been hearing a lot about how digital communities of interest can leverage a variety of new technologies to get involved in making a difference to society and the environment. So we started looking at some cool New Zealand made apps that help deliver on these goals and which were also featured at the conference.

[Friendsafe](http://archived.link/http://friendsafe.co.nz/) are a young team of entrepreneurs that sprang out of a recent Startup Weekend event. FriendSafe is a mobile app that enables journey sharing from start point to destination in order to improve a traveller's sense of personal safety. The app includes an emergency alerting service involving audio, video and geo-location data. The app also generates notifications about potential dangers and incident statistics drawing on government open data. We were pleased when Friendsafe won the Startup Weekend open data award sponsored by [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/), [LINZ](http://www.linz.govt.nz/) and [Mix&Mash](http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/) and it was thrilling seeing the team making some [influential friends](http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/speaker/geospatial-technologist-of-google) after their conference presentation.

Overseas delegates at the summit have been learning a great deal about New Zealand's beautiful natural environment and especially how geo-spatial technology is being used to protect species under threat. [WhioForever](http://whioforever.co.nz/whio-forever/) is a project that generates crowd-sourced data to monitor populations of the endangered Blue Duck (Whio). 

[Loomio](http://loomio.org/) is an open web-based tool that enables participative decision-making for organisations. Loomio team members played a big role in the lively panel session on 'Growing Up Digital' at the close of day two.

[PocketJobs](http://archived.link/http://pocket.jobs/) didn't feature at Digital Earth, but it's a nice example of an application that not only solves a problem but builds a social community that actually generates some real value. PocketJobs makes it easy to match 'micro-task' offers with willing workers.

iwantmyname is a global domain registrar providing internet infrastructure that enables [next generation apps](https://iwantmyname.com/services). We also support community based initiatives that promote entrepreneurship and positive environmental and social outcomes through the intelligent use of technology.
