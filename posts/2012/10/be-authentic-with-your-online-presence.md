Not sure if I agree with the headline but TechCrunch's "[Here's To The Death Of Personal Branding On The Internet](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/heres-to-the-death-of-personal-branding-on-the-internet/)" reminds us of an important theme when [building an online presence](https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile):

> Folks, you don't need a "handle" on the web and a tagline to get noticed for the things you have to say or share. All you have to do is be consistently you, as difficult as that might be for you. Don't let other people tell you what to be, how to act or what to share. Also, don't be a purposeful contrarian to get attention either, unless that's really how you are.
>
>  People are like snowflakes, but by making yourself become a "brand," you're turning yourself into a nondescript pile of dog poo. Don't do it. You're worth more than that.
>
>  Be you. Be real. Please.
