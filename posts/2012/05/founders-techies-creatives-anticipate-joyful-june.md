The chill of Winter may be upon us, but that's no reason to despair. There's an exciting collection of events lined up this month for founders, techies and other creative misfits.

If you love Google services then the [Auckland Google Technology User Group](http://archived.link/http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-GTUG/) (GTUG) is the place for you. This meetup group has regular sessions on topics ranging from Android development to [Google Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain). Auckland also gets to enjoy another [Startup Weekend](http://auckland.startupweekend.org/) this month at a new venue over the bridge at the Massey University campus in Albany. Expect 54 hours of start-up madness plus lots of great learning and networking. Tech founder Marie-Claire Andrews will be speaking about ShowGizmo at the [Wellington Hackers & Founders](http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/events/60395282/) group this month. [ShowGizmo](http://www.showgizmo.com/) is a [mobile app](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/mobile/) that aids knowledge networking at major conferences all over the world. As a New Zealand based, but global [domain registrar](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) iWantMyName is very pleased to be a [sponsor](http://www.hackfund.me/) of Hackers & Founders.

It's also great to see [Bizdojo](http://bizdojo.com/) supporting tech user groups in the community by offering a free venue for meetups. The newly formed [Data Without Borders](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Without-Borders-NZ/events/66909372/) group will convene at Bizdojo's Wellington co-working space at the end of the month with the help of [our CTO](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about). This event will interest data scientists, [software developers](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) and global thinkers. Last, but certainly not least, look out for the [Gather Barcamp](http://gathergather.co.nz/) with an overflowing stack of local notables and a web and creative agenda made by you. Art, design, engineering and science, it's a fantasmic lucky dip.

Did we miss anything? If so, you will probably find it in the New Zealand [Startup Digest](http://startupdigest.com/), a weekly compilation of all the coolest start-up, technology and innovation events.
