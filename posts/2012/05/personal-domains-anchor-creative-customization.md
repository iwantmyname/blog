It is always exciting to see domain names released into the wild and being put to good use. We've noticed that there is a burgeoning community of artists, designers and makers promoting their pet projects on the web these days. There's also a growing number of attractively designed [hosted services](https://iwantmyname.com/services) like [Cargo](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain), [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url) and [500px](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/02/photo-hosting-service-500px-increases-exposure.html) that make it really easy to create and domain customize an attractive art [portfolio](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/).

Here are some great examples of creative showcases. [Reclaiming Value](http://www.reclaimingvalue.com/) is a U.S. based site that sharpens our imagination by exposing the simplicity and beauty inherent within tastefully recycled objects. [Anais Gato](http://www.anaisgato.com/) is a freelance graphic designer from Barcelona who attracts new projects from all over Europe by posting examples of previous assignments on her [Cargo Collective](http://cargocollective.com/) site. [Tessa Fox](http://tessafox.com/) is a talented photo-journalist who covers the film and music scenes in both U.K. and Australia. 

The resurgence of interest in design and creativity is certainly happening at grassroots level, but the Internet is at the heart of a much broader cultural and creative shift taking place that will have global implications. For example, respected and influential media such as [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21553017) and [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/11/3d-printing-autodesk/) regularly publish articles talking about the coming revolution in distributed and additive manufacturing. It's clear now that prophetic companies like [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com/) were onto something big when they got into remote [3D manufacturing](http://www.gizmag.com/olaf-diegel-3d-printed-guitars/21787/) and began building an online community of designers and makers.
