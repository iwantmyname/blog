**Wilkommen Bienvenido 欢迎光临  Kia Ora Velkommen Namastey Добро пожаловать Selamat Datang Bienvenue Welcome!**

After a busy New Year period, iWantMyName welcomes all new customers and recent arrivals. [2011](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html) ended with some political fireworks in the domain industry as the world's largest domain registrar attempted to recover from the crisis arising from its support of the misguided [SOPA legislation](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/make-a-move-for-good.html). For many registrants it was the last straw after years of poor service and painful image blunders. The result was a flood of customers initiating [domain transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice) in protest. 

As a relatively new player in the market (3 years now!) we were thrilled to see lots of enthusiastic [testimonials](https://iwantmyname.com/about) flying around the Interwebs, with our existing customers heartily recommending iWantMyName to their friends. We even got a mention in [Mashable's article](http://mashable.com/2011/12/29/how-to-move-your-domain-name-account/) detailing how to move your domains - a nice acknowledgement. So, thanks everyone for your continued support. 

This year we've got big plans with new additions to our [app marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services), improvements to [domain search](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/new-faster-domain-search.html) functionality and some feature redesigns as we look towards the introduction of new generic top level domains. Onwards and upwards into 2012!
