Vancouver based ex-pat New Zealander Tim Johnson wanted to do something to help out his quake damaged hometown of Christchurch, so he set up a company called [Dot Kiwi](http://dot-kiwi.com/) to create and administer a new domain name. Appropriately, a portion of the profit from sales of the proposed .kiwi domain will be earmarked for the Christchurch recovery. 

The [.kiwi domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dotkiwi) proposal has been made possible by [last year's policy changes](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html) within Internet governance body ICANN that cleared the way for the development of more Internet real estate in the form of new generic top level domains (gTLDs). Dot Kiwi is well positioned to address the technical and legal challenges involved, having [KEA World Class New Zealander](http://www.keanewzealand.com/wcnz) and immediate past Chairman of ICANN, Peter Dengate-Thrush on board as a director.

Mr Johnson, who has a background in software development and technology business management, was at the forefront of efforts to rally Canada-based New Zealanders in the wake of the Christchurch quake disaster. In his role as CEO of Dot Kiwi, Johnson sees a bright future for the new domain, which he expects to complete initial regulatory hurdles around early 2013. With over a million Kiwi ex-pats abroad the .kiwi domain obviously lends itself to individuals or businesses who want to [create a unique online profile](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) for themselves. "We also think .kiwi will redefine the domain name market in New Zealand and lead to a wave of innovation in new services and applications", he says.
