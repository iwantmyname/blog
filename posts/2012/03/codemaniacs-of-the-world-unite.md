[Codemania](http://codemania.co.nz/) was very likely the coolest
tech conference to hit Auckland in a long time, so it was a pleasure
to be able to host an [iWantMyName drinks meet-up](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/03/hola-codemania-meetup.html) for delegates the evening before
the main event. Judging by the contented faces, the hospitality was well
received, especially by those who (like the [iWantMyName team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about)) were coming from out of town.

It didn't seem to matter if you were a Sharepoint fan or an [open source](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/open-source/) advocate, we all agreed that good beer tastes even better when imbibed over a conversation with a fellow start-up techie or [software developer](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/). Platform agnosticism aside, Codemania put on a wonderfully diverse show by all accounts and we are guessing that a bigger venue may well be on the cards for next year.

Participating in the [software community](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html)
 both here and abroad is part of our underlying philosophy, mostly 
because we love hearing your thoughts about how we can improve and grow.
 iWantMyName is a [global domain management](https://iwantmyname.com/) service with a predominantly 
offshore customer base and hence we are doing our small part to take 
Kiwi technology to the world. 

Special thanks to head honchos Ben Gracewood and Ian Randall for organising Codemania and for letting delegates know about the meet-up and also Dan Khan for sharing with the [Tech Startups](http://www.meetup.com/auckland-tech-startups/) followers in Auckland. Cheers to the friendly crew at [The Bluestone Room](http://www.thebluestoneroom.co.nz/) for taking good care of and us keeping the cervezas flowing. We certainly hope to put on a repeat performance next year.
