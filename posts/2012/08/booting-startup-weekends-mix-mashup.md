**Updated: Mon 27 August**

Startup Weekend was held for the first time outside of a main centre and entrepreneurs in Palmerston North and the surrounding region ably rose to the occasion. **What's For Lunch** took out the top prize with a tablet app concept to make healthy cooking and eating fun for kids.

We remember what it's like to be a tech start-up. Aspiring entrepreneurs need all the advice and support they can get during the early stages. As a society we must also assist people to connect and share ideas and ingrain a stronger sense of entrepreneurial culture in New Zealand, especially amongst young people. That's why we love Startup Weekends.

As usual [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) offered free [domain names](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) to every team that progressed from the initial pitching sessions, plus we co-sponsored drinks on Friday evening at the opening. But wait, that's not all! We helped pull together a fantastic prize package for the [Open Data App category](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/2012/06/27/digital-earth-offers-open-data-app-opp/) in conjunction with [Mix & Mash](http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/competitions) and the global [Digital Earth Summit](http://digitalearth12.org.nz/). The requirement was to build an application that leverages New Zealand open data sources, with $1000 in cash and gifts on offer. It was heartening to see [FriendSafe](http://archived.link/http://friendsafe.co.nz/) take out this award with their geo-location app for keeping travelers safe. Well done!

By the way, we also recommend a whole bunch of [developer tools](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) that can be hosted on your domain, so you can get your Startup Weekend projects up and running even faster. The next New Zealand Startup Weekend will be in [Tauranga](http://tauranga.startupweekend.org/) 14-16 September.
