Landsat, the orbiting Earth imaging satellite has been faithfully transmitting data home for forty years. Now with the aid of [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.org/), scientists can perform amazing time series studies across the globe on all sorts of natural features as well as looking at cultural impacts such as deforestation, urban sprawl and agricultural land use. Opening up of this data puts [new perspectives](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezn1ne2Fj6Y) on the concept of a digital earth and has implications for a remote island nation such as New Zealand that depends heavily on natural resource exploitation to earn a living.

Google Earth Engine aggregates the world's satellite imageryâ€”making it available online for researchers to map trends and quantify differences around the Earth.  [Landsat](http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) passes over the same bit of ground every sixteen days and has documented a vast amount of the Earth's surface sequentially. This data was first made publicly available in 2008. But until recently it was difficult to work with. The evolution of inexpensive, high speed distributed computing changed all that.

Digital Earth has come to mean an interdependent set of technologies that bring the hope of better addressing global environmental and societal challenges.  As the technology for digitally observing our world improves, we may also begin to contemplate how we preserve our own personal digital legacy and where this sits in the wider context of digital earth. Anchoring your [online profile](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) with a [domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) remains the most enduring way to secure and manage your digital earth space. 

The [Digital Earth Summit](http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/) opens in Wellington on 2nd September. [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) is a proud co-sponsor of this year's open data [Mix & Mash competition](http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/competitions) at Startup Weekends in conjunction with the Digital Earth Summit and Land Information New Zealand.
