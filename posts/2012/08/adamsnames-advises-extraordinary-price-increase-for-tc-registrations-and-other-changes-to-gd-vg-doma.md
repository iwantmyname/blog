We thought we should let you know about a very substantial price increase that has recently been invoked by [Adamsnames](http://adamsnames.tc), the registry operator for .TC, .GD and .VG domains. Unfortunately we have no choice but to pass these increases on to our customers and we apologize for this unexpected change.

The new price for a .TC domain will be $119.00 USD annually, effective immediately. We have suspended new orders until further notice but existing registrations can still be managed in [your iwantmyname dashboard](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard).

If you have a .TC domain that is due for renewal, you may be considering whether or not you wish to continue to invest in maintaining the domain. We'd hate to lose you, but (under the circumstances) if you choose to [cancel your domain](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/235018-how-do-i-cancel-my-domain-registration-)â€”we will understand.

Adamsnames also announced a major system upgrade and is moving to a new registry back end. After the migration, new registrations and domain updates will be handled in real-time. Furthermore [changing registrars of .GD and .VG domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) now follow the industry-standard transfer procedure using authorization codes. Due to this upgrade we were able to reduce the price for new registrations as well as transfers of Grenada's and British Virgin Island's domain extensions from $49 to $45 USD.
