After almost a decade of development, WordPress has steadily evolved from being a slightly clunky system for blogging enthusiasts into a mature, widely used content management system deployed with well over [70 million sites](http://en.wordpress.com/stats/) globally. 

Word Camps are leading the charge in championing the product around the world and New Zealand is no exception. Plans are well underway for the next local event. [WordCamp NZ](http://wordcamp.org.nz/) just keeps getting better each year and the aim is to bring Kiwi WordPress fans together for some inspiring talks and updates on where the platform is heading. The conference has a cool new downtown Auckland venue this year and will be held on Saturday, 21st April, so mark your diaries now and standby for registrations to open.

We currently recommend WP Engine for professionally managed WordPress hosting services and you can easily [domain customise your WordPress site](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/wpengine-wordpress-custom-domain) with a one-click set-up from within the iWantMyName customer dashboard.
