From [Hobbits](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html) to [hurricanes](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html) to [Halloween](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/10/scared-bitless.html),
 it has been a very full and challenging year here at iwantmyname. Now 
with summer holidays approaching, rest assured that we'll be around to keep 
an eye on your domains whilst you are at the beach.

This year we launched a fresh [new design for iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html)
 encompassing improved search speed and functionality. 2012 was also the
 year in which we tracked hundreds of aspiring domain applicants as they
 prepared bids for launching new top level domains, some with merit and 
others downright [domain crazy](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/more-new-domains-wtf.html). 

We've got big plans for 2013 as well, including more development on our customer interface. February in particular is shaping up as a huge month in tech here in the capital and we are looking forward to attending [Multicore World ](http://archived.link/http://multicoreworld.com/index.php/mw/mw12)and [Webstock](http://www.webstock.org.nz/). Of course we will continue our support for [Wellington Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) and many [other meetups](http://meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/) and [community groups](http://up.org.nz/). We also plan to do our bit for the economy by taking on [more staff](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/are-you-a-kick-ass-front-end-developer-join-us.html) in 2013 and moving to bigger and brighter premises as we grow globally.

None
 of this would have been possible without the support of you our valued 
customers however. Apart from your domain business, we truly appreciated
 all of your [feedback](http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general).
 We want to make registering and managing a domain name easy and fun, so
 it really helps us to improve when we hear about our customers' 
experiences.

**Best wishes for a safe and happy Christmas from the [iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about).**
