It's Easter time. For some people this means chocolate confectionery, [egg rolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_roll) and a curiously wet tradition called [Dyngus Day](http://goodgrape.com/index.php/articles/comments/oh_dyngus_day_and_drinking_with_the_prez/). For others it's a time of religious reflection. However you celebrate Easter, there's sure to be fun with friends and family and probably some amusing photos and stories to tell. It's a great time to begin or update your blog or image portfolio.

Your friends may be flocking to Facebook, but let's face it, there's nothing interesting about its dull, corporate, cookie-cutter approach to online content sharing. If you want something a little more personal, there's now a wide range of hosted [blog services](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/) and [portfolio apps](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/) available to help you express your creativity - and we're making [new additions](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/14-new-hosting-services-applications-for-your-domains.html) to our [App Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) every week.

Even better, you can easily domain customize most of these services with a single click from within the [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/) dashboard. Don't be left with egg on your face this weekend. Get hopping and start your own personal abode on the web.
