Top level domains may be on the way soon, but the dotFM registry was amongst the first to promote a country code domain (ccTLD) for wider commercial use. Fifteen years along the track, our domain DJ charts the progress of this ground-breaking registry.

The [.FM domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia) originated as a ccTLD allocated to the tiny Pacific Island chain of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), a self-governing state formerly under United States stewardship until independence in 1986. Being small and highly dispersed and with a population of just over 100,000 there was quite limited local demand for the domain, so a plan was devised whereby San Francisco based [BRS Media](http://www.brsmedia.fm/about_us.html) would market .FM to the global online media industry.

The domain obviously offers the perfect home for anyone involved with Internet radio; but .FM has also been adopted widely by businesses and individuals from across the broader media, entertainment and music industry. Included amongst the more notable users are music recommendation sites [Last FM](http://www.last.fm/),[ BlipFM](http://blip.fm/) and [Turntable FM](http://archived.link/http://turntable.fm/) as well as popular regional radio channels such as [Jazz FM](http://www.jazz.fm/). Newly launched Official FM is the latest aspirant with its attractive offering being [featured in TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/23/official-fm-launches-its-new-music-promotion-platform/) recently. With hundreds of millions of Internet radio listeners tuning in globally, BRS are now also pitching to deliver .RADIO, one of the first [new TLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/new-top-level-domain-extensions-are-coming.html) off the block.

iWantMyName is promoting .FM domains at a [special price](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia) of $85.00 this month.
