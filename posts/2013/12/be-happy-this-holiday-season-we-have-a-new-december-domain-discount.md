<!-- excerpt -->

It's the final month of the year, and we have some great domain discounts to pass along. Some that carry over from November, but one great new one--[.BE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium).

<!-- /excerpt -->

[.BE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium) is the domain extension for Belgium, and is perfect for businesses in the European country, as well as websites that want a clever domain hack (maybe something like iwantto.be?). For the month of December, [.BE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium) domains are on sale for $14.90 USD, 21% off their normal price. 

There are a number of other domain extensions for sale, including [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory), [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) and [.CC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands), so check out our [Special Offers page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer) for the full rundown. And be sure to check back at the beginning of each month for great new updates.
