<!-- excerpt -->

For non-developers, [nothing is more intimidating](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/dont-be-scared-of-github-pages.html) than stepping into the world of GitHub repositories. It seems like you could commit an infinite amount of time to learning various programming languages and still not get to where using GitHub makes sense. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

But now it's easier than ever to inch your way into the ecosystem. [From GitHub:](https://github.com/blog/1719-github-pages-just-got-easier)

> Now, [pages.github.com](http://pages.github.com) will walk you through the steps of publishing your first site in minutes, whether it's via Git for command line, GitHub for Windows, or GitHub for Mac.
>
> For GitHub Pages veterans, we've also taken the opportunity to surface some great GitHub Pages resources to learn how to take advantage of the Jekyll templating engine, for example, or how to set up a custom domain.

If you're ready to make the leap (and I think you definitely are), [grab your domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain) and start creating your very own static HTML5, CSS or JavaScript page with GitHub Pages today.
