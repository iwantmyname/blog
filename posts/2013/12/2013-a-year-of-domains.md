<!-- excerpt -->

Where did 2013 go? The year in which we celebrated our [5th birthday](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/happy-5th-birthday-iwantmyname.html) seems to have flown by at break-neck speed. Perhaps this is partly because we were gripped by astonishing world events both good and bad. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

On the one hand we were shocked by the [cyclone disaster](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-disaster-help-if-you-can.html) that overtook the Philippines and galvanised nations into action throughout the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, we were excited by the bloom of [new top level domains](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/the-next-batch-of-gtlds-are-here-including-careers-photos-and-shoes.html) (gTLDs) that have finally been approved by internet governing body ICANN and for which we have begun to prepare.

It was also a year in which we increased our engagement in the local community through initiatives such as [Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/2013/12/18/the-twelve-gifts-of-christmas-startup-weekend-edition/), [Rails Girls](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/rails-girls-rally.html) and [Kiwi Code Retreat](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/kiwi-code-retreat---advancing-the-art-of-coding-software.html). That involvement looks set to continue early in 2014 with [Wellington Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) and [Drupal South](https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/) headlining in February.

Events in the Philippines led to us to bringing forward our long held plans to contribute a portion of our sales revenue to social causes. What more deserving beneficiary could there be in 2013? We [selected](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html) Save The Children's Philippines fund to support. 

The global economy also showed some signs of improvement this year and we responded by adding our first U.S. based employee [Chris Hall](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/chris-hall-is-a-writer.html). He's being doing an outstanding job delivering high value web content that gets us noticed in the world. If you want to keep up with the latest in tech tips and updates on the domain name business, be sure to check out our [international blog](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/) channel. It seems our promotional efforts and rising international reputation did not go unnoticed - in 2013 we even got a [nice mention in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/technology/personaltech/planting-your-flag-on-a-patch-of-the-web.html). 

On the home front, the New Zealand registry began marketing the [new .nz domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) after a hurry up from [.kiwi](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/kiwi-domain-ready-to-fly.html) which got the nod from ICANN earlier in the year. We are expecting 2014 to be just as busy with more gTLDs in the pipeline plus more development to make iwantmyname even better. 

**Best wishes from [the iwantmyname crew](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about), thanks for supporting us this year and have a safe and happy Christmas.**
