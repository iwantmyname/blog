[From Eric Mill - konklone.com:](https://konklone.com/post/the-power-and-potential-of-github-pages)

> In recent days, my usage of Github Pages has drastically increased. It's an incredibly useful way to get things online for free, and since it's part of a developer-friendly platform, you can repurpose it for all sorts of things.
>
>  I think I've stretched Github Pages pretty far, and so I thought it'd be helpful to describe the different ways I've found it valuable in my personal and professional work.
>
>  1. Publishing a dynamic, nice-looking document.
>  2. Quickly getting files online.
>  3. Giving a simple home to a working community.
>  4. Creating a simple data hub.
>  5. Creating a sophisticated data hub.
>  6. And finally, its original purpose: project documentation.
