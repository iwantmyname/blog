<!-- excerpt -->

It was in mid 2008 when two Germans and a Kiwi came together in New Zealand to start a company (a new domain name management service to be precise). I had known my now co-founder Lenz Gschwendtner from the domain industry in Germany and we shared the same business vision, so we eventually met at his home in Wellington to chat about the current state of DNS services and startups in general.

<!-- /excerpt -->

Shortly after that first meeting, with the help of my fellow co-founder Paul Spence's operations background, we began working on *iwantmyname*. In just a few weeks we went from registering the company to launching a very basic product to customers (for example, we didn't even accept [domain transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) at the beginning). 

And we proved our assumption correct--the internet was craving a domain registrar built around great customer support and user experience. Because nobody has the time to mess around with confusing services and [endless upselling](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/no-upselling-tactics-to-be-found-here.html). People wanted a simple site to buy domains and get things up fast. We were called the anti-Go Daddy, and found our place as a niche domain registrar around the web.

It's hard to believe that this week will mark iwantmyname's fifth year on the web--an achievement we couldn't possibly have accomplished without our amazing customers and [such a great team](https://iwantmyname.com/about). In our five years, we've grown to seven employees, serving 50,000 customers worldwide with more than 100,000 domain registrations, renewals and transfers processed. So thank you, thank you, thank you. We couldn't possibly say it enough.
