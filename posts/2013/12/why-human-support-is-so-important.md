[From Bill McBride - Calculated Risk:](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2013/12/will-google-kill-my-blog-on-december-6th.html)

> My credit card expired this year - as credit cards do - and Google notified me that I'd have to update my payment information to pay for the URL. No problem. I updated the information in my Blogger / Google account, but Google doesn't seem to recognize this.
>
>  I've tried contacting Google, posting messages in Blogger and Google forums, and I've received no response. Help at Google tells me I'm a "free account" (even though I pay Google every year) and there is no help for me.

This isn't indicative of all platforms that offer combination site builders and domain hosts (although we definitely recommend keeping them separate), but we can't emphasize enough how important it is to be able to contact a real person. With Google, the answer is often "you can't." But if you're [hosting your domain with us while using Blogger](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/blogger-blogspot-free-blog-with-own-url), a real person will [happily answer](http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname) your [support questions](https://iwantmyname.com/support) every time.
