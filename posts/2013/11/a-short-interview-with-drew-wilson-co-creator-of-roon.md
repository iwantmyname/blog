**iwmn:** Thanks so much for chatting! First off, tell me a little about what makes Roon a great blog platform for someone like meâ€”a guy who just wants to blog.

**Drew:** Thanks for the opportunity! Roon was built to make it super easy to go from sign up to your first published post as fast as you can type. There are no settings to configure before posting your content and it'll look great on all devices. We do have optional settings for those who'd like to customize their Roon blog a bit, but he interface and the platform was designed to put all the focus on the writing experience and not the level of visual customization. 

Roon also doesn't claim ownership over your content as other platforms do, and you can export your entire blog at anytime.

**iwmn:** We've seen a lot of platforms lately go practically CMS-free, but Roon has a web app, an iOS app and a Mac app on the way. That's a pretty impressive lineup! Do you think it makes for a better user experience that way?

**Drew:** 100%! Writing in a native app is a much better experience than writing in a web app. Giving people the options to use these native apps for free only makes the Roon platform that much more convenient and really sets it apart from all the other competitors out there. Native apps are also quicker to pull up, making it more convenient to jot ideas down as drafts when they come to you. 

**iwmn:** It seems that every day I see a new Twitter post screaming "DON'T READ THE COMMENTS." Given that Roon doesn't have comments for posts, give me your thoughts on author/audience interaction.

**Drew:** We purposefully did not add traditional comments to Roon because they aren't the right way for authors to engage and converse with their readers. Twitter is a much better platform for comments than a traditional comment thread at the bottom of a post because it forces people to be concise with what they say. We plan to move beyond Twitter and implement our own commenting system to Roon in the future, but it will not be a traditional comment thread system.

**iwmn:** So Roon is free at the moment, and that always scares me a bit. Will Roon always be free?

**Drew:** Roon will always be free, with various features available as paid upgrades. We already have two paid upgrades: Custom Domains and Analytics.

Custom Domains gets you the ability to run room on your own domain. Analytics enables you to add in 3rd party analytics tracking, like GoSquared or Google Analytics. We'll be adding more Roon specific tracking the Analytics package soon. We also have a few more paid upgrades that will launch soon. Blogging on Roon will always be free though, as will our native apps.

**iwmn:** And finally, what does the future look like for Roon? Any amazing new features coming soon? Plans for world domination?

**Drew:** We have tons of great plans for Roon. But both Sam and I know the full future of Roon will be something we can't predict. Just like most other platforms, the community has a huge part in the future of the product. We're excited to see where that leads. 

Just around the corner we'll be launching Multi-Blog. Everyone will be able to manage multiple blogs under their one username. You'll have a dedicated blog URL for each of your blogs, as well as a new "User Page" that will be a mash up of all your posts from all your blogs combined. Multi-Blog will be free for everyone. 

Shortly after that we'll be launching Discovery. It will be available on the web and in our native apps and you'll be able to browse posts from others. Discovery will bring the Roon community together and will make it easy for you to find and read posts written by others that you're interested in.

Right now we're just focused on making a great platform for people to write great content and not worry about spending time to make it look good. We take care of it all for you.
