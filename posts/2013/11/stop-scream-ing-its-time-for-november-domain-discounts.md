You guys, Halloween is over. And now that you've had your fill of all the frights and screams the season has to offer, it's time to get your hands on a new domain name. 

Here's what's [on sale this month at iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer):

<!-- /excerpt -->

[.CO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia): It's the de facto short version of .COM, but did you know .CO is the country-code domain for the beautiful South American country, Colombia? Get your .CO domain this month for only $15.50 USD.

[.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro): It's all about...me?

And now, you can get your .io domain for only $49.00 USD.

[.AC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-international-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island): Every site owner wants to ascend to greatness, so why not pick a domain that's from the Ascension Islands? It certainly doesn't take a brani.AC to pick yours up this month for $49.00.

[.AM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/am-armenian-domain-name-registration-for-armenia): It's a dre.AM of a domain extension, and now you can pick up your .AM domain today for $79.00 USD. Really, there aren't many extensions better than .AM for a good domain hack.

[.CC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands): If you're looking to take a credit card, or are creating a creative commons of sorts, it might make sense to get a .CC domain. And now's the time, as they are on sale for only $19.90 USD.

[.SX](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sx-st-maartener-domain-name-registration-for-sint-maarten): It's a bit unconventional, but with .SX domains only open to the public since November 2012, a great short domain still could be available. Find yours this November for only $29.00.
