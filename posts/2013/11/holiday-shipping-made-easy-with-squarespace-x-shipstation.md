[From Thomas Chau - Squarespace:](http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-shipstation)

> The welcome spike in sales that comes with the holiday season is all too often accompanied by the challenge of fulfilling all these additional orders. The manual process of printing shipping labels is one of the biggest drains on a merchant's already limited time. To relieve some of the burden, we are excited to announce a partnership with ShipStation, fully integrating their leading web-based shipping software to create a seamless experience that will save merchants tons of time in shipping. 

If you're looking to set up an online shop for the holidays, definitely take a look at [Squarespace with ShipStation](http://www.shipstation.com/squarespace_pricing/?utm_source=SQSP&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=announce_blog&ref=SQSP).
