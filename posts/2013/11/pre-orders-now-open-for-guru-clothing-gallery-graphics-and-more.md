<!-- excerpt -->

Come one. Come all. Pre-orders* for the following generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) start today:

<!-- /excerpt -->

+ [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru)
+ [.CLOTHING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing)
+ [.GALLERY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery)
+ [.GRAPHICS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics) 
+ [.PLUMBING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing)
+ [.CONTRACTORS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-contractors)
+ [.SEXY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sexy)
+ [.CONSTRUCTION](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-construction)
+ [.TATTOO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo)
+ [.TECHNOLOGY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology)
+ [.ESTATE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-estate)
+ [.LAND](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land)
+ [.BIKE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike)

And why would you be looking to get one of these fine gTLDs, you ask? Look at it this way. Let's say you're looking to start a gallery called *Hall*. Chances are, every derivation of the words *Hall* and *gallery* are going to be taken in the .com world. So while you could get a country code TLD (ccTLD) domain like hallgallery.is, the new gTLDs give you a great opportunity to help *categorize* the web. 

With a nice gTLD like .GALLERY, you could use Hall.gallery, because Hall is...a gallery. And if this particular Hall wasn't a place, but a guru, you could use Hall.guru. The possibilities are endless, so get excited. Try a new gTLD out. We really think they're going to change the web.

Pre-order your [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru), [.CLOTHING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing), [.GALLERY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery), [.GRAPHICS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics), and all the other gTLDs listed above today.

***

These pre-orders are simply expressions of interest and do not mean you are guaranteed to get your desired domain name. And here's why:

* Pre-order availability does not guarantee availability on iwantmyname.
* All domains ordered by multiple customers will go through an internal lottery once the pre-registration period is over.
* If your order is selected by iwantmyname, it will then be submitted against all other domain registrars who may be after the same domain.
* For some of the more popular requests, it will take a bit of luck, but rest assured, we will do our very best to secure your requested domain for you.
