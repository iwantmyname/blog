<!-- excerpt -->

The Philippines may have quite possibly suffered its worst natural disaster in recent history as Super Typhoon Haiyan passed directly across the tropical Western Pacific archipelago. If you are struggling to comprehend the enormous power unleashed by a storm of this magnitude, check out [this BBC video report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24906576)
 filmed during the onslaught, when winds were reportedly gusting over 185 m.p.h (300 km/hr)! The full extent of the disaster is not yet clear, with reports of a death toll anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 and literally millions displaced. So, how can we help?
 
<!-- /excerpt -->

Other Pacific rim nations such as Japan, Taiwan, United States, New Zealand and Chile are well acquainted with natural disasters such as [tropical storms](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html) and [earthquakes](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-photos/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503036), so I'm sure we can all 
empathize with this tragedy. But we may also be feeling a little powerless to help. A while ago we were delighted to add the [Philippines domain](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html) to our registrar offerings; so it only seems right to contribute something back at this difficult time. Children suffer most of all during a disaster, so [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) has made an immediate cash donation to UNICEF today. This is a relief agency established within the United Nations to support children at risk globally. The American Red Cross also has a [special fund](https://www.redcross.org/donate/index.jsp?donateStep=2&itemId=prod4650031) aimed specifically at getting resources into the affected region. If you wish to donate anonymously, you can do so by using the [Givealittle](http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=2663) platform and selecting your preferred recipient relief agency. 

Whilst this tragedy continues to unfold, it is difficult not to feel great concern for the Philippines nation which has already suffered so much this year with numerous storms and earthquakes. As a business based in the Asia-Pacific region we feel a social responsibility to contribute; it's a sentiment that we have backed up by [participating directly](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html) in aid programmes in the past. I hope you will join us and give what you can to the people of the Philippines. Even a small financial donation can go a long way in times of need.
