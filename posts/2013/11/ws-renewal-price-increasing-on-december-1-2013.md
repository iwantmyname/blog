A bit of unfortunate news this morning from your friendly neighborhood domain registrarâ€”if you've registered, or are looking to register, a [.WS domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa), be aware that the domain registry manager [WebSite.ws](http://website.ws) has announced that **renewal prices will be increasing** on December 1, 2013.

Please note that this price increase does not change the purchase cost, just the renewal rate after your first year, which is changing from $US 19.00/yr to $US 34.90/yr.

Ok, the bad news is over now. All that's left is this [loop of a pug licking your computer screen](http://www.sanger.dk).
