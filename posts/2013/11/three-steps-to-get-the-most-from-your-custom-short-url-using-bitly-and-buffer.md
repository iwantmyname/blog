Take a look at your Twitter feed and you'll likely see how pervasive custom short URLs are becoming:

It's a trend we're seeing more and more of, and it's a fantastic way to brand your social content. And best of all, it's a simple task to accomplish using Bitly and Buffer. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

###1. Get A Short Domain Name. 

The first step to branding your social posts is to get a shortened domain name. For instance, if you look above you'll see daringfireball.com (18 characters) shortened to df4.us (6 characters). The goal here is to make the most of your 140 characters on Twitter by limiting the length of your links. 

So set your sights for [iwmn.me/VSOb/5mCr9l3O](http://iwmn.me/VSOb/5mCr9l3O) to get a custom short domain that'll be automatically setup for Bitly. The key is to make it short, uncomplicated and related to your brand name—whether it be your company or personal brand. 

And if you already have an iwantmyname domain name, just login and head over to our [marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services), choose Bitly, then hit Install. 

###2. Get Your Bitly Account.

Once you have your custom domain, head over to [Bitly](https://bitly.com) and get an account. Then, in settings, you can set up your custom short domain for personal or business use. The setup is super simple, and because you already have the custom domain setup through iwantmyname, your work here is done.

###3. Get Buffer. 

If you're a social media manager or someone in charge of posting for a number of social platforms at once, [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com) is an invaluable tool. In one place, you can manage Twitter, Facebook, Google+, App.net and Linkedin, and see a host of stats on how your posts are performing. 

But what makes Buffer truly amazing is its integration with third-party platforms—like Bitly. To set up your Bitly service, simply go to Settings, then Link Shortening. 

Now, when you go to post a link (or automatically post from your blog), Buffer will automatically shorten your link to your chosen custom short name, like this:
