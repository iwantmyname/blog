[From Lauren Orsini - ReadWrite:](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained)

> People use GitHub to host projects ranging from music composition to cookbooks to municipal data. But what you might not know is that GitHub isn't just a storage locker, but also a showcase. That is, GitHub allows you to set up a bare-bones website you can use to display projects and collaborate.
