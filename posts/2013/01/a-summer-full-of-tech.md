[Summer of Tech](http://www.summeroftech.co.nz/) is a great initiative that matches tertiary students with intern positions in the technology sector. [Unlimited Potential](http://up.org.nz/) is Wellington's largest community of information technology professionals offering engaging networking events promoting knowledge sharing, innovation and entrepreneurship. Those are just the kind of projects we love getting involved with, so we were over the moon when UP and SoT got together to run a [tech panel session](http://up.org.nz/events/summer_of_tech_panel_agm) this week.

It's an interactive panel discussion looking at technology and society, with some high profile players from our industry venturing forth with a few opinions about where technology is taking us in the future. Cloud computing, robotics, [apps](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services), virtual wallets, internet freedom...you can be assured of some lively debate. Of course there will also be beer and pizza to round off the evening.

As part of our support for tech events in the community, we are also sponsoring [Wellington Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/). We make it easy to [domain customise artist and designer web portfolios](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/) and have an enthusiastic following amongst designers globally. Consequently, we are keen to give something back by providing a free ticket for a design student to attend the event. If you are a designer currently enrolled at a tertiary institution and have not yet registered for Startup Weekend, please [contact iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support).
