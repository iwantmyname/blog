There was no mistaking the focus for Sir Tim Berners-Lee when he spoke to a packed house of over 300 at Te Papa in Wellington this week. As one of the leading developers of software that launched the Internet, he is perhaps the strongest and most high profile advocate for openness and inter-operability across the worldwide web that he and other researchers created. It was an opportunity not to be missed by the[ iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about).

The physicist and computer scientist has a particular interest in the application of open data after being prevailed upon by the British Prime Minister of the day Gordon Brown to take charge of releasing government data into the wild in order to create economic value and social advances. The U.K. [Open Data Institute](http://www.theodi.org/) promotes and manages use of open data from government sources and assists entrepreneurs to develop related business projects. That led to other initiatives around the world including our own [data.govt.nz](http://data.govt.nz/). 

It's fair to say Berners-Lee was largely preaching to the converted, the gathering was literally a "who's who" of almost anyone influential involved in the web technology industry in the Capital. Thanks heaps to [InternetNZ](https://internetnz.net.nz/) for helping coordinate Sir Tim's visit to New Zealand and for providing a live feed so others could participate. We understand a [recording](http://new.livestream.com/i-filmscience/tbl-internetnz) of the talk will be made available shortly.
