title: "Posthaven: A Second Look At The New Posterous"
---

We wrote a [few months back](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/migrating-your-site-and-custom-domain-from-posterous-to-posthaven-made-easy.html) about Posterous closing down and the new service created by the original co-founders called [Posthaven](http://posthaven.com), which was intended to save Posterous blogs forever. The company offers hosting for blogs for just $5 a month and says that they intend to keep it that way forever.

It wasn't entirely clear what the intentions for the future of Posthaven was, but the company has been adding a number of [useful features over the last little while](http://blog.posthaven.com/posthaven-launches-fast-beautiful-image-galleries). This week, they added a new photo gallery function which offers beautiful, fast and responsive photo galleries. The company even claims they're the "fastest photo galleries on the web" and are utilizing Amazon's S3 storage to deliver the photos.

The company has also added the ability to [post to social networks](http://blog.posthaven.com/one-step-closer-to-posterous-parity-autopost-to-twitter-and-facebook), the ability to add [create pages and menus](http://blog.posthaven.com/new-features-pages-links-and-menus) as well as the ability to [embed audio, video and documents directly in posts](http://blog.posthaven.com/new-features-post-video-audio-and-documents). There are a ton more things they've been adding [over on the blog](http://blog.posthaven.com/), making the site more appealing by the minute.

With a [pledge](https://posthaven.com/our_pledge) like Posthaven's, I'd feel comfortable moving in permanently. They've even got the best [blog importer](http://blog.posthaven.com/the-posterous-migration-guide) around! We're excited by the promise of a blog that'll last forever and if that excites you too, you can [easily register and set up domains for Posthaven with iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/).
