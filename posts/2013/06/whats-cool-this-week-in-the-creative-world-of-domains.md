It's always fun flicking through new domains that have been registered and especially any cool creative websites or interesting initiatives online. Naturally we like to share the love around a bit, so here's some great New Zealand sites that came to our attention recently. 

First up, Canterbury University started up a great [video competition](http://archived.link/http://uc360.co.nz/) called UC360. Contestants are invited to submit a 360 degree panoramic video clip that is funny and reflects student life. UC360 is only open to University of Canterbury students, but the introductory video on the homepage is very clever and worth checking out just for fun.

We've [raved about this site](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/cargo-website-showcases-retro-revival.html) previously, but [Revival Furniture](http://revivalfurniture.co.nz/) are still going strong with their wonderful line of retro recycled furnishings. Imagine your favourite old comfy chair given a new lease of life with a woolly blankie upholstering. The site is also a good example of how to create a tasteful sales brochure using [Cargo Collective as your hosted website builder](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/).

Richard Fortune and Lee Bennett could best be described as leading "movers and makers" in co-creation and maker technology scene in New Zealand. Fortune co-founded the Makertorium showcase held at Te Papa and also set up [Colab181](http://archived.link/http://co-lab181.co.nz/), a maker space boasting it's own laser printer. Bennett, who once constructed his own home-built aircraft, founded [Wellington Makerspace](http://wellingtonmakerspace.com/), a well equipped project centre for creative and technically minded people. Both men see the provision of public education services as the way forward in attracting more people into the maker community. Wellington is also the home base for [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) a popular global web-based service that facilitates 3D manufacturing. 

Need a clever [domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) for your creative, design or innovation project? Check out the many [hosted website builder](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/) and [creative portfolio](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/) offerings that we can easily customise with your own domain. We've also got a big [discount on .IO domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) at present for that special web address.
