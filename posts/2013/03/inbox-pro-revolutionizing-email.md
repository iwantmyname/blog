title: "Inbox Pro: Revolutionizing Email?"

If you're like almost everyone I know and are drowning in email, you probably realize that it's a problem and there really isn't a great solution for email overload out there yet. Gmail has released a handful of tools like priority inbox, but many of us still haven't figured out a way to efficiently keep on top of things.

Inbox Pro, an ambitious new startup has set out to solve that problem and help evolve email past a basic concept. No longer should it be just a messaging protocol, it should be able to assist us in actually dealing with information overload. Currently being kickstarted using a pledge based platform, the service that promises to solve our email woes is just 12 days and $29,000 out from being a reality.

[The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/voice/2013/02/08/inboxpro-com-structured-communications/) calls Inbox Pro a "frighteningly ambitious" project and rightfully so. There are plenty of projects out there that plan to revolutionize email -- and have to some extent -- but none have caught on to the mainstream just yet.

###How Inbox Pro Works

If a Inbox Pro user is sent an email, the message will be placed in the users' queue and the sender will receive an automatic reply with a handful of options.The automatic response will give the sender an idea of how long on average the user is taking to reply and will likely bounce many senders at this stage.

If not, they are invited to "optimize" their email by following a link and categorizing it as:

 - Yes/No question
 - FYI Message
 - Short Message
 - Long Message

Each type of message will show the sender the average response time and will obviously show that short answer questions are answered faster than long ones. Additionally, emails are able to be given an expiry time by the user so that they disappear into the 'expired' box if they are not dealt with in time and the sender is notified of this case

There are plenty more brilliant features that the team plans to bring to Inbox Pro and you should read the post in full over on [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/voice/2013/02/08/inboxpro-com-structured-communications/).
