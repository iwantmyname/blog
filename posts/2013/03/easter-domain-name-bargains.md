It's hard to believe that in five short years we already became New Zealand's largest single retailer of country code top level domains (ccTLD). But we haven't forgotten about our bread and butter! That's why we've got an amazing Easter offer of 1000 [.NET domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network) and [.COM domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial) for sale at the rock bottom price of only $9.90.

With a huge 50% price reduction on the most "eggs-cellent" popular global domains, these perfectly formed domain names will fly out the door faster than freshly baked hot cross buns. If you can't find a .NET or .COM you like then choose from our selection of over 100 other domain extensions, then use our easy one-click setup to domain customise your favourite [hosted service](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services).

It's a long weekend, so now's the perfect time to get "cracking" on that new blog or website you've been thinking about. So hop to it and [register your domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) today.
