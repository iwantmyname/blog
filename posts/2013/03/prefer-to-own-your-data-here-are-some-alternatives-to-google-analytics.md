[Google Analytics](http://web-analytics-software.findthebest.com/l/1/Google-Analytics "Google Analytics") has become somewhat of the tool of choice for most people who run their own [website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website"). After all, it's free, and what's better than free, right?

You're always giving something in exchange for [Google](http://google.com "Google") offering a service for "free" and in this case, that's data on your website. There are some great alternatives out there that many aren't aware of so we've made a short roundup of the ones we liked most.

**[Clicky](http://getclicky.com "Clicky Web Analytics")**

Think of Clicky as Google Analytics' slightly worse looking cousin. It's got a great set of tools that won't leave you wanting alternatives and guarantees your data isn't disappearing into somewhere to be used for research.

Clicky features real-time statistics, [Twitter](https://twitter.com "Twitter") monitoring, a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress") plugin as well as an [iPhone application](http://www.apple.com/itunes "App Store (iOS)"). It's great at letting you dig into your data and show it in meaningful ways. Clicky is slightly faster to update than Google Analytics too, so it's great for if you've got a large spike in traffic.

Clicky is a hosted solution, so has a few price tiers as well as a free version. It's free for up to 3,000 payviews per day, and after that will cost to use. We've found that the Wordpress plugin for Clicky works much better than Google's alternatives.

To sign up for [Clicky](http://clicky.com/), visit their website.

**[Mint](http://www.haveamint.com/ "Mint (software)")**

This is a self-hosted Google Analytics solution and comes from the same developer as the very inspiring Google Reader alternative, [Fever](http://www.feedafever.com/). Mint is all about "less is more" and offers very basic functionality but shows data in a very meaningful and easy to read way.

The basic functionality can be extended upon with their "Peppers" which are 3rd-party developed tools that extend the platform. Some may be turned off by the basic nature of the solution, as it only really shows you basic statistics and they can't be sorted much further past that.

Mint is available for $30 USD a license which covers you for one website. It has real-time statistics and must be hosted by the user.

The other catch is, whilst it's a great tool, there isn't a free trial. You either jump in head-first or not at all. That said, many reports online say that Mint is a great tool. You can buy Mint from their website [here](http://www.haveamint.com/).

**[Piwik](http://piwik.org "Piwik")**

Did somebody say [Open Source](http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source "Open Source")? We're glad you did. There's a few great open source tools too, such as Piwik, which lists itself as a direct competitor to Google Analytics and is totally free.

Piwik has been downloaded 1.2 million times, so it's definitely popular for a reason. The product is stylish, self-hosted and highly customizable. There's even a live demo [available on their website](http://demo.piwik.org/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=7&period=day&date=yesterday#module=Dashboard&action=embeddedIndex&idSite=7&period=day&date=yesterday&idDashboard=1) so you can try it out before you actually go ahead and install it.

The dashboard is entirely customizable and allows for setting it up just how you like. To get Piwik, just [visit their website](http://piwik.org/features/) and download it. It's free forever!

**Open Web Analytics****

**If you're looking for something that's extremely similar to Google Analytics in its ease of use and even design style, this is the one for you. You'll feel right at home.

![analytics-open-web.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2013-03-05-analytics-open-web.png)

Open Web Analytics is an open-source self-hosted alternative to Google Analytics and is even able to run inside of Wordpress as a plugin, which makes it especially easy for those new to these kinds of services to set up.

It's very feature rich, and offers a lot of ways to sort statistics that are gathered, just like Google Analytics. Open Web Analytics updates in real time, so you've always got the latest statistics. You can even use it to show heatmaps and mouse tracking to see how your users behave on your website!

Open Web Analytics is completely free and can be downloaded from [their website.](http://www.openwebanalytics.com/)
