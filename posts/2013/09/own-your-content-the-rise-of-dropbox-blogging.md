There's something to be said for ownership. Owning your house. Owning your car. But what about your content?

Let's face it—the average blogger isn't interested in dealing with server space, the cPanel interface or ftp servers. They just want to blog without any of the hassle associated with backend development. And if current web trends are any indication, many bloggers are willing to pay a premium for things that simply work. 

Platforms with blogging capabilities like Virb and Squarespace are making huge waves in the industry by providing simple setups and beautiful responsive templates. Even WordPress—which offers loads of great templates for blogging—is seeing a boom in great tech startups offing hosted solutions with guaranteed uptime and instant site and plugin updates. And lets not forget about the massive free platforms like Blogger and Tumblr that are offering free blogging with few strings attached.

But when your content is tied to a specific blog platform, what happens to it if the platform seizes to exist? Will you have total control over it? Will you know how to export and reformat it to adhere to another platforms CMS standards?

###Enter Dropbox.

For the sake of conversation, let's say traditional blogging is like a checking account. Each bank or credit union has safeguards in place to keep your money liquid, but it'll never be as readily accessible as if you just had a pile of cash in your closet. 

Like that pile of cash, Dropbox-based blogging platforms give you on-demand access to every single post you create. Just write your copy, save it your site folder in your Dropbox account, then view it right there on the web. 

Best of all, instead of being bound to a proprietary WYSIWYG editor (i.e. needing to login to a page to write and edit content), Dropbox blogging platforms let you use just about any plain-text word processor on the market. Mou. iA Writer. TextEdit. Anything. You're in complete control of your writing environment.

###So where do we come in?

At iwantmyname, our goal is to make installing a custom domain the easiest step in the site-creation process. And through our [apps and services marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services), we offer easy domain installation to some of the best Dropbox powered blog platforms for writers, including [Sctriptogr.am](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/scriptogr.am-custom-domain) and [Calepin](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/calepin-custom-domain).

Using our domain dashboard, you can also use platforms like [Scrivr](http://skrivr.com/) which are not in our app marketplace by simply updating DNS records in accordance with the platform's specifications (there's typically an explanation of how to do this in the corresponding FAQ page).

So if you're a blogger looking for a simple solution to take control of your content, maybe it's time to give a Dropbox-based platform a shot. Or better yet, with your files all available through your Dropbox account, you could try all the platforms out for a week or two without having to deal with content exporting or data incompatibility. When your content is truly yours, you have the freedom to do just about anything.

**Update:** And if you need even more reason to take control of your content, here's a real-world horror story from .net magazine:
