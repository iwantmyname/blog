Remember how great turning 4 was? No bills. Worries. Responsibilities. Just an unrelenting desire to build block towers and eat cookies. 

Well, Pagely is turning 4 this month, and all it wants is for you to try their amazing hosted Wordpress hosting services for a monthâ€”for free.

<!-- /excerpt -->

> What's a birthday without gifts?  How about trying Pagely on us? [Sign-Up now or anytime in the month of September and pay nothing for 30 days][1]. In our history we rarely do promotional codes and even rarer has been any type of free trial.

So if you're looking for optimized load times, best-of-class security and automatic core/plugin updates, give them a shot. 

And if you need a domain name to go with your new Pagely site, [we're always here to help][2].
