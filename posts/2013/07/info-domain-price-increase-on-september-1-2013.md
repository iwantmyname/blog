[![.INFO Domain]({{ site.images_url }}/2013-07-29-logo-dot-info-domain.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information)

The .INFO domain manager [Afilias](http://afilias.info) recently announced that they will be increasing their annual registration fee for registrars on September 1, 2013. Unfortunately, we have to pass on this registry price change and our registration/renewal fee for .INFO domains will increase from $14.90/yr to $15.50/yr accordingly.

Please note that this is an increase in price by Afilias only. We will not be adding any additional margin on top of this price increase. We hope for your understanding in this matter.

If you're interested in purchasing a [.INFO web address](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information), they are currently on sale for $12 USD so now's a good time to [snap up your domain](https://iwantmyname.com)!
