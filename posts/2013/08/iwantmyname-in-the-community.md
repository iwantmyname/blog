Almost everyone knows that [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) is the coolest and most fun place to manage your [domain names](https://iwantmyname.com/domains), but did you also know that we support lots of good stuff in our local community here in New Zealand as well as [projects in the developing world](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html)? With our tech start-up scene [making waves](http://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccafannin/2013/08/19/feeling-the-startup-scene-shaking-in-wellington/) globally, it's good business sense to participate and also a lot of fun.

[Startup Weekends](http://www.startupweekend.co.nz/) have really taken off here in New Zealand and iwantmyname was one of the earliest backers, providing mentors, organisational support and cash sponsorship. Recently I enjoyed the amazing privilege of being a judge at a special [social enterprise themed Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) event in our home town Wellington. We think encouraging and educating young entrepreneurs is one of the most important planks towards building a stronger economy and a more participatory society.

Our city has a lively tech and start-up community networked by numerous meetups, user groups and world class tech conferences such as [LeanUX](http://optimalexperience.com/what-we-do/lean-ux/), [Drupal South](http://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/) and [Webstock](http://www.webstock.org.nz/14/). We sponsor the local [PHP User Group](http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/) and [JavaScript Users](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/) plus we are big fans and supporters of [Hackers & Founders](http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/). We also started the [Growth Hacker Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/), for tech founders interested in tools and tips for building a business online. The whole ecosystem here is fueled by good coffee and excellent local [craft beer](http://garageproject.co.nz/), which helps lubricate most of the deal making and brainstorming done around town. 

If you are heading down to New Zealand for a conference or holiday, make sure you catch up with the [iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.com/about) at one of the many tech conferences or meetups on offer in our area.
