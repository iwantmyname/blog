<!-- excerpt -->

We came across the following tweet from [Marco Arment](http://marco.org) today which serves as reminder that you should control your online identity:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Writers: You don’t need Medium. You can host your own blog on your own domain with lots of other tools and hosts.&#10;&#10;Be your own “platform”.</p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/statuses/362613401861636098">July 31, 2013</a></blockquote>

For those of you who don't know [Medium](http://medium.com), it has become popular amongst creative people and focuses on a collaborative writing experience with a very clean and simple user interface.

Kenneth Reitz, developer at [Heroku](http://heroku.com), further elaborates on [why he switched from Medium back to self-hosted](http://kennethreitz.org/why-i-left-medium/):

> * I couldn't embed any content in a post. Not even that tweet.
> * I couldn't track referrers to know where my readers are coming from.
> * I couldn't search Twitter for my posts because of the massively shared domain.
> * I couldn't even use [gaug.es](http://gaug.es).
> * I couldn't pick my own URLs.
> * I couldn't do anything but keep writing.

Our mission at iwantmyname is to make it as easy as possible to register and set up your own domain name. The [apps and services marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) also lists lots of hosted apps for all types from individuals to businesses. We've handpicked a few of them that are especially suited for writers who want to have more control over their content:

Now some of you might ask: but what about my content on closed platforms such as Tumblr or Squarespace? That's a valid question but Tumblr's acquisition by Yahoo! earlier this year [resulted in lots of import tools](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/worried-about-your-tumblr-blog-after-the-acquisition-by-yahoo.html) by other services and the internet community for example. Most of the mentioned companies also allow you to export your data at any time which you should look out for when evaluating your next home on the web.

If you have any questions about [registering your own domain](https://iwantmyname.com) or need a recommendation which service to choose, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://iwantmyname.com/support)!
