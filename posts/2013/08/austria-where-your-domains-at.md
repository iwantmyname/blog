Question. Which landlocked European nation was home to one of the greatest composers of all time and has borders with no fewer than eight other countries? 

<!-- /excerpt -->

Answer. The Republic of Austria or Republik Ã–sterreich, as it is known by its 8.5 million German speaking inhabitants.

Austria has a fascinating and convoluted political history but emerged from the turbulence of the first half of the 20th Century as one of the wealthiest nations on the planet. This success has hinged not only upon enduring and stable democracy but also because of it's highly strategic geographical position in relation to the powerhouse economies of Europe.

With its rugged alpine backbone being a picturesque draw card for ski tourists, Austria manages to attract an astounding 21 million foreign visitors annually. But you do not have to travel all the way to Austria to have a presence there. .AT is the Austrian domain name and has lots of fans from all over the world.
