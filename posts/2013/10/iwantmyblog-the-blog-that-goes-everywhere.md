<!-- excerpt -->

It was 2002, and I had a Xanga site. An angsty Xanga site where I talked about food and music and life and all the things a guy predisposed to have a Xanga site in 2002 were into. 

But one day it dawned on me that the hit-counter adorning the bottom of my page actually wasn't a cool feature. And that the "Currently Playing" widget attached to each of my posts didn't even work half the time. Maybe if I found a new blog platform, I could take my soapbox to level 11. 

So I ordered a pizza, watched The Big Lebowski for the 50th time, waited 10 years, and here I am. Ready to find the next great blog platform.

###The plan of action.

In the last decade, a lot has happened in the blogging world. Templates got better. Responsive design became a thing. Social media went bananas. There's quite a bit of catching up to do, and a ton of new blog platforms to try out. All said, it's going to take an incredible amount of time.

So, to make it easier for myself, I'm giving each blog platform a solid week. With my trusty [iwantmyblog.com](http://iwantmyblog.com) domain name in hand, I'll work fast to build a basic site on Monday, spend the middle of the week writing about the platform and be out by the end of Friday. Then, with a clean URL and (hopefully) a mess of content in some sort of export file, I'll take my blog on the road to the next platform. And so on. 

###Follow me. 

If you're so inclined, come follow me on my little journey at iwantmyblog.com, or just keep reading the [blog at iwantmyname.com](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/) for all the bigger stories. And if you want to connect and talk about the platform I'm currently using (or the one I should use next), just send me an email at `<chris@ideegeo.com>`. 

**Next stop:** [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am/), a Markdown-using, Dropbox-based blog platform with a surprisingly nice website.
