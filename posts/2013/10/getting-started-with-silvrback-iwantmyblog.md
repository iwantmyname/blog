There's something refreshing about blogging on a platform meant for blogging. I mean, platforms like Tumblr and Squarespace provide a nice array of writing tools and readability themes, but if you're simply looking to blog without distracting bells and whistles, a platform like Silvrback is definitely what you're looking for. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

###Focus

I've talked about [Dropbox blogging](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/own-your-content-the-rise-of-dropbox-blogging.html) a lot recently, and how "owning" your content should be more of a priority. But one of the hurdles Dropbox blogging will have to overcome is complexity. For instance, to publish a file to a blog like [Scriptogram](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/using-scriptogram-the-normal-way-and-with-mou-iwantmyblog.html), you have to write your post locally, save it to a Dropbox folder, then trust that it'll sync properly. And if you want to go back and edit it (or delete it), you have to go back into your file and make your changes, then again hope the sync works as it should. Which doesn't always work out like you think it will.

Now as Dropbox platforms become more mature (and step out of permanent beta), things may become more seamless, but right now, nothing beats a platform with a clean CMS and a managed hosting platform*. And Silvrback is just that. Simply sign up for a payment plan, fiddle with a few settings options (don't forget to set up your custom domain!) and you're ready to write. Presto change-o.

###Writing

After the setup process, the real joy of using Silvrback is the content editor. Unlike many other platforms that have you write in a confined space with a nasty case of the WYSIWYGs, Silvrback lets you write in simple Markdown, and even has a little button for toggling distractions from the screen. It's just you and your content, autosaving every time you touch a key. Even image uploading is easy (one of Markdown's few drawbacks). Just hit "Insert Image," copy the link provided into your post and check it out in the preview pane. 

So far, Silvrback seems to be a writers dream. But keep following throughout the week at [iwantmyblog.com](http://iwantmyblog.com/) as I try to break things and cause problems.

*Self hosting is obviously a better solution for some, but users looking to get started with no backend knowledge or patience for that sort of thing, managed hosting is the way to go.
