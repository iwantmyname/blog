<!-- excerpt -->

New Zealand has a lot more going on than just sheep and Hobbits. Being based in New Zealand we're especially excited to report that steps are well underway to finally bring the second level domain .nz to the public very soon. This aligns New Zealand with most other jurisdictions that already allow registrations at the second level, for example [.us](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us-american-domain-name-registration-for-usa), [.eu](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe) and [.co](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) domains, to name but a few. It also opens up previously unsurveyed domain space that will no doubt be eagerly sought after.

Currently the most popular domain extension in New Zealand is the third level extension [.co.nz](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) which is largely populated by the local business community. Opening up the .nz domain landscape will create new branding and promotional opportunities plus some amusing (and valuable) domain hack possibilities. How about thefo.nz, ipo.nz, cartoo.nz ? Let your imagination run wild!

Further public consultation on the proposal is likely in 2014 and no firm date has been set for implementation as yet; but the ball is rolling and gathering pace it seems. In the meantime we'd love to help you keep in touch as developments unfold further. Shortly we will start taking expressions of interest, so that we can let you know what's happening well ahead of the actual .nz launch. Of course there's no obligation whatsoever. Don't miss out on adding this new domain to your portfolio.
