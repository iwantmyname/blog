<!-- excerpt -->

**iwmn:** Hi Lee, thanks for doing our very first user interview! So first, tell me a bit about yourself and what you're up to these days. 

**Lee:** I'm a full stack developer and general level-headed guy, who gets the job done right and on time. For the past 5 years I've been the technical director at [Click Innovate](http://www.clickinnovate.com). I love to attend hack events and contribute to open source as much as I can.

<!-- /excerpt -->

**iwmn:** So you just got a new domain. If you don't mind me asking, what is it? And what are you using it for?

**Lee:** I've registered a few domains with iwantmyname and this most recent one was for a mobile based assassin game called [appsassin](http://vimeo.com/77907408) "appsass.in". It was registered for a [hack event I've just won](http://ilee.co.uk/yet-another-hackathon-victory/). Who wouldn't love a game where you assassinate other players with your mobile phone? :)

**iwmn:** Congrats on your win! So here's a deep one. ICANN is just now starting to roll out the [new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (extensions like .blog, .music and .dad). Give me some thoughts. Think they'll take off?

**Lee:** Good question. I think there will always be a primary urge to snap up a ".com," but with so many registered I've recently turned to .io and other TLDs that can incorporate the name. The new TLDs are clearly going to be successful (some more than others), even if only due to current exhaustion. I'd register a .app for sure for an app.

**iwmn:** Self promotion time. Tell us something the world should know about.

**Lee:** I love to write and record music when I have free/spare time. The last time was in 2010 and [you can listen for free on Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/00k6x6Vzj8OaecWMHTi4is).

**iwmn:** And last but not least, what should I eat for dinner tonight? I have a really hard time making these decisions on my own. 

**Lee:** Steak (rare) with chilli.

**iwmn:** Well said, Lee. Well said.
