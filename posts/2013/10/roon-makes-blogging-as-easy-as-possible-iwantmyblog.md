<!-- excerpt -->

It's amazing to think how much the blogging world has changed in the last 10-15 years. In just a short period of time, we've gone completely full circle, from plain HTML to terrible WYSIWYG editors to less terrible WYSISYG editors to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)â€”a simplified version of HTML.

Setting up shop in the modern realm of Markdown blog platforms, [Roon](https://roon.io/) is unquestionably built with the blogger in mind. Once you sign up (it's free), you're presented with a distraction-free screen with a pane for writing, a pane for managing content and familiar icons dedicated to inserting images, previewing posts, editing text and posting to social platforms. 

Less obvious is where to find your settings (hint: your image on the bottom left is a button). But within these settings options are all the customization tools available--and some of them are quite important:

+ You can use a custom domain name in Roon, but it costs $12/yr. A modest price considering the free cost of the service. Once you get to this point, don't forget to install Roon in the [iwantmyname marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/)--it makes adding your domain name a cinch.
+ Analytics can be used, but unlocking the tool to input your tracking code costs another $12/yr. Again, a modest price.
+ There are no HTML/CSS customization options. Just a toggle between a serif/sans serif font, an input for an accent color and some bio entry tools. Before you start with Roon, get a good look at what the template looks like. It's clean, easy to read and responsive, but if you don't like it, maybe this platform isn't for you.
+ There's also a wonderful export button that lets you export your content if you ever choose to move platforms. Not that you should be looking to leave, but if you do, the Roon team sends you a nice folder with all your posts in Markdown file format. I kind of love that they do this.

Additionally, there's an [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id634949849) available for mobile posting, and it comes complete with all the tools available on the web app. If you get your hands on an iPad with an [Incase Origami](http://goincase.com/shop/incase-origami-workstation-for-ipad-2) and Apple keyboard, there's really no need here for a computer.

It's...the future.

**Final Thought:** One thing I really like about Roon is that it purposefully doesn't include a comment system. According to [Roon Support](https://roon.io/support/), "if you add your Twitter username to your Roon account your readers will be able to comment on your posts via Twitter."

This brings me back to an [old post](http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/whats_fair) from John Gruber on Daring Fireball:

> You write on your site; I write on mine...What makes DF an efficient and effective soapbox is exactly that it is not noisy. My goal is for not a single wasted word to appear anywhere on any page of the site.
