From Christine Willett - [ICANN](http://blog.icann.org/2013/10/first-new-gtlds-get-the-green-light-for-delegation/):

> The time has come! Today, the first four domains from ICANN's New Generic Top-Level Domains Program were cleared to proceed to delegation. This marks the start of a measured roll out of new gTLDs, which are designed to expand opportunities for businesses, communities and Internet users around the world.
>
> These first new gTLDs, or strings, are:
>
> + شبكة (xn--ngbc5azd) - the Arabic word for "Web" or "Network"
Registry : International Domain Registry Pty. Ltd.
> + онлайн (xn--80asehdb) - Russian for "Online"
Registry: Core Association
> + сайт (xn--80aswg) - Russian for "Web site"
Registry: Core Association
> + 游戏 (xn--unup4y) - Chinese for "Game"
Registry: Spring Fields, LLC

This is amazing news, as we'll soon be seeing more and more gTLDs (i.e. generic domain extensions like .blog and .music) roll out to the public. You can already subscribe to updates on the above mentioned top-level domains [.онлайн](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-онлайн), [.сайт](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-сайт), [.شبكة](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-شبكة), [.游戏](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-游戏)—we will notify as soon as further information about final launch dates and pricing comes to hand.
