From [Ghost](http://blog.ghost.org/public-launch/):

> Today we are very proud to announce the first public release of the Ghost blogging platform to the public.
>
>Following three weeks of intense testing after [launching](http://blog.ghost.org/launch/) to our 6,000 Kickstarter backers, today we are releasing an updated Ghost 0.3.2 to everyone in the world.

For those who haven't read up about Ghost yet, it's a wonderfully simple blog platform designed to give writers the ability to write without any of the hassle associated with more robust site-building platforms like Wordpress and Squarespace (here's a link to the [original "manifesto"](http://john.onolan.org/ghost)).

And if you're a designer, you also might want to check out the $5,000 Most Wanted Competition. It looks like a great way to get your name out to (and support) the Ghost community. 

> Our launch partners [Envato](http://envato.com/) today announced a [$5,000 Most Wanted Competition](http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/envatos-most-wanted-5000-for-ghost-themes/110967) to seed their brand new Ghost Themes category on ThemeForest.
