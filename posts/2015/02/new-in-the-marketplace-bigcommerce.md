For many people, e-commerce was the first big draw of the internet. You could go online, pick out things like clothing or electronics, then have the items shipped directly to your house. It was the future. 

But the first e-commerce sites really weren't very sophisticated. They were slow, complicated, and pretty walled off from the rest of the internet. Compare that to [Bigcommerce](https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/bigcommerce) and...well, there really isn't any comparison. With Bigcommerce, you get custom websites, secure carts, digital product catalogs, marketing tools, reporting, mobile-optimized shopping, etc., etc. And their online stores can literally be created by business owners who have no coding or design capabilities whatsoever. It's truly amazing.

Here's what the web is saying about Bigcommerce:

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiadishman/2014/03/19/why-bigcommerce-says-its-ready-to-take-on-amazon-web-services-to-help-retailers/): "Stringfellow says that Bigcommerce’s biggest competitive advantage is that it allows any small retailer to scale from its first sale into the millions. “On average a Bigcommerce client generates nearly twice as much revenue as our nearest competitor,” he underscores. Stringfellow also notes that merchants can choose the look and feel of their store via a marketplace of responsive themes. “We are also consistently optimizing the merchant’s store management interface, the website and all client interfaces to ensure we present the most optimal experience.”"

[Signal v. Noise](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2727-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-bigcommerce): "That desire led to BigCommerce, which is now approaching 10,000 paying customers. According to Harper, the company has grown 480% over the last 4 years and is the fastest growing ecommerce platform in the world. It was ranked the 14th fastest growing software company (#633 overall) on the Inc 5,000 list for 2010 and it now has 50 employees spread between its Sydney, Australia and Austin, Texas offices."

[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/bigcommerce-raises-40m-from-steve-cases-revolution-growth-to-help-smbs-manage-e-commerce/): "As founders Eddie Machaalani and Mitchell Harper explain, for as little as $25 a month merchants can set up a storefront and make their first sale within 48 hours. As ecommerce continues to grow in an Amazon-dominated world, Bigcommerce wants to be the layer for SMBs to operate a various sales channels. So a merchant could sell on Amazon, and eBay but have Bigcommerce be the platform from which they sell these goods.

“Bigcommerce is the big equalizer,” Case said of the company. “Now every entrepreneur can have Amazon-like e-commerce capabilities, in hours – not months or years.”"
