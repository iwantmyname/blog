How many times have you come up with a big idea, spent the money, time, and effort needed to get it going, only to watch it flame out after a few months due to a lack of traction. It's hard to know how successful an idea will be before launch, but and easy way to find out is with [QuickMVP](https://iwantmyname.com/services/marketing/quickmvp).

QuickMVP's "5-Minute Technique" is just about as simple as it sounds. You create a quick landing page that tests the demand for your idea, set up some Google Ads with their built-in ad creator to spread the word, then sit back and see what happens. It sounds ridiculously easy, but the methodology has been used successfully by many of today's brightest entrepreneurs.

Here's a little case study from the [QuickMVP blog](http://quickmvp.tumblr.com/post/88837748550/validating-an-ny-times-best-selling-title-with) about Tim Ferriss' naming of The 4-Hour Workweek:

> He bid on keywords related to the book’s content such as ‘401k’ and ‘language learning’: when those keywords formed part of someone’s search on Google the title popped up as a headline and the advertisement text would be the subtitle.
>
> Ferriss was interested to see which of the advertisements would be clicked on most, knowing that he needed his title to compete with over 200,000 books published in the US each year.
> 
> At the end of the week, for less than $200 Tim discovered that “The 4-Hour Workweek” had by far the best click-through rate. The rest is history.

The next time you're in the testing stage of a big idea, keep [QuickMVP](http://quickmvp.com) in mind—it's a bit of a no-brainer. The process isn't quite free, but anything beats throwing money at an idea that might not be market-ready.
