Is it useful? If so, how can we make it even *more* useful?

These are the questions we've been asking a lot of ourselves lately, and they represent what I think is the goal of this vast world we call the internet. Just think of the progression from the pre-internet world to now:

+ 1970's - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a record to play at home. 
+ 1990's - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a CD to play in your car. 
+ 2000's - You read an album review online (quite useful), then download the album to listen on any of your devices (still a chore).
+ The future - The album you want and all the content around it are integrated. There are no barriers. Listen, discover, and share, instantly. I can't think of anything more useful than that.

That's the goal of the internet. Reduce the noise, reduce the work—all so you can instantly get what you want, right when you want it.

Before starting at iwantmyname, I used iwantmyname for one very specific reason. They had a [big collection of platforms](https://iwantmyname.com/services) available for me to plug-in to without having to find any DNS instructions. When I think of an idea, the last thing I want to do is figure out how to get the thing I want to use up and running. With iwantmyname, I could start sites on platforms like Squarespace, Virb, and Tumblr in a snap. 

But what I only subconsciously realized was how much clutter I'd removed from my life. Instead of reading review after review of every new CMS under the sun, I had a place to go that had some cultivation going on. A place where I could quickly check out some of the coolest platforms on the web, and then add them to my domain with just a few clicks. iwantmyname bridged that gap from discovery to creation, and it saved me time. So much time.

Fast forward to today and we have so many hosted platforms to discover in the iwantmyname [Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services). You'll find big ones like [Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url), [Cargo](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain), [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url), [Shopify](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software), and [Big Cartel](https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain), as well as the platforms that tend to fly under the radar (but are still mighty useful) for non-developers, like [Ghost](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain) and [GitHub Pages](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain). Without needing to login or buy anything, you can browse through 100+ platforms, and when you're ready, you can grab a domain and start creating content in a flash. 

It's easily one of the fastest ways to go from platform discovery to site creation on the web while still giving you the flexibility to change platforms in the future and add other useful things like [email](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/) and [custom forums](https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/).

## The future of the Marketplace

Then we come back to our original question. How can we make our [Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) more useful than it is today? A couple weeks ago, the whole team met in Wellington to plan out the future of the site. Plenty of things were discussed, but one of our main focuses was the Marketplace—particularly, what we can do in the future to make it more useful. And the solution (well, at least one of the solutions) was content. 

Vigorously remove any content doesn't help people get from point A to point B faster, and put a much larger content focus on the platforms we plug-in to than our own. We already have the tools in place to get you going on a platform, and we already have a large (and growing) selection of platforms available. What we're missing is the added content needed to remove the initial research barrier. Not editorial, but useful content that breaks down what each platform does, and how their featuresets can uniquely work to bring what's in your head to life.

![Future Marketplace]({{ site.images_url }}/2015-04-16-future-marketplace.jpg)

In this future Marketplace, you should be able to have a solid idea of what a platform does without having to go searching elsewhere, and hopefully that extra level of information will translate to real time saved. And that's what we're after. Saving you time so you can get back to building. 

Enough about our plans though. Is there anything you'd like to see in the Marketplace to make it more useful? If so, [drop us a message](https://iwantmyname.com/support). We're always open to suggestions.
