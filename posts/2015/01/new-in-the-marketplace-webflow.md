*Our [App Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the "New in the Marketplace" blog series.*

It seems like every website builder has some sort of drag-and-drop feature these days, but the functionality is never quite what you think it will be. There are often limitations, and the dragging and dropping is often limited to template locations and conventional ideas. With [Webflow](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/webflow) though, you really can tinker to your heart’s desire—it’s almost like a modern rethinking of Dreamweaver, but fully hosted and not tied to a Creative Cloud.

Here’s what others are saying:

[TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/11/responsive-website-builder-webflow-raises-1-5-million-from-khosla-tim-draper-others/): "Today, Webflow lets designers build responsive websites using a drag-and-drop website builder with an intuitive interface in order to customize their site with common web elements, like sliders, maps, buttons, divs, videos, social widgets, and more. On the backend, Webflow generates W3C-compliant HTML5 and CSS3 code. There aren’t many competitors for a service like this, beyond to some extent, Bootstrap, Foundation or Adobe’s Edge Reflow – but those require more a more advanced skill set to use."

[Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/05/designing-responsive-websites-browser-webflow/): "Webflow is a tool targeted at designers who are looking for an alternative to Photoshop and Fireworks for responsive web design. It’s not an all-encompassing solution for creating websites — at least not yet — but by enabling me to focus on layout, interaction and content behavior without having to code, it sped up our team’s design phase immensely."

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2014/05/08/webflow-lets-designers-create-websites-without-learning-to-code/): "Webflow’s vision is to do the same thing for web design as tools like Blogger and WordPress did for personal publishing. Those tools completely took down technical barriers (previously you had to be a master of HTML and FTP to get your thoughts online) and opened up the world of publishing to orders of a magnitude of more people, and in the process transformed the web. Similarly, web design currently requires designers to be masters of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the change is inevitable and Webflow plans to lead the charge."

Best of all, the platform has a free tier to get started on, and a ton (seriously, a lot) of short [tutorial videos](http://tutorials.webflow.com) to help you learn the platform.
