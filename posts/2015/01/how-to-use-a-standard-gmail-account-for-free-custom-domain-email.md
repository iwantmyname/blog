[From Ian Macalinao:](http://simplyian.com/2015/01/07/Hacking-GMail-to-use-custom-domains-for-free/)

> It’s pretty much common knowledge that GMail is awesome. It’s fast, connects seamlessly with the rest of your Google services such as Drive, has a cool app called Inbox, and is overall an extremely powerful email service. However, to use it with a custom domain, you need to purchase Google Apps for either $5 or $10/month, which for casual users is a bit unnecessary. On top of that, you don’t even get all of the features a personal account gets, e.g. Inbox.

> However, there’s a free way to use your GMail account with a custom domain: Mailgun.

Neat trick for more advanced users to set up custom domain email using a standard Gmail account and [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com) (for up to 10,000 emails a month). [Yes, you can still get free custom domain email addresses](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/yes-you-can-still-get-free-custom-email-addresses.html) — even in 2015.
