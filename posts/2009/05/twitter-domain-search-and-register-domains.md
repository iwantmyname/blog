In addition to being [Apple geeks](https://iwantmyname.com/iphone), we're also big suckers for **simplicity and productivity** at iWantMyName. So we thought: why not offer a domain search feature for a service where we spend lots of time anyway? Hence the concept of our [**iWantMyName Twitter Search Bot**](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname) was born.

As of today you're able to **check domain name availability** by sending a direct message to the _@iwantmyname_ Twitter account. Just start following us, send "d iwantmyname thedomainyouwant.com" and we'll reply with the search result including a link to immediately register the domain:

**Search for alternatives** if a domain is taken:

Immediately **register the domain** if it's available:

 ![twitter-domain-search-free.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2009-05-19-twitter-domain-search-free.png)

So **whenever you think "I want my name"** just open the Twitter client of your choice and off you go!
