At iWantMyName we strongly believe in an open and inclusive internet for all people on this planet. Hence we are always happy to support new technical developments that move us towards a truly internationlized web. We are making a special effort to roll out new services that enable multi-lingual functionality across the global web infrastructure, as these services become available.

Although it may still take a while until we will see localized versions of the .COM, .NET or .ORG suffixes, ICANN is making steady progress in pursuing changes to introduce internationalized country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .РФ (.RF - Russian Federation) or .бг (.bg - Bulgaria) with a possible start date as early as 2010.

### .NAME introduces IDN registration

As a further step to tear down language barriers on the web [VeriSign](http://www.verisign.com ".COM / .NET / .NAME Registry VeriSign"), the domain registry for [.NAME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names ".NAME domain"), enables the registration of [internationalized web addresses](https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names "Register Internationalized Domain Names") with non-latin characters beneath this domain extension. From Nov 7th, you will be able to search and register domains in the [same language scripts](http://www.verisign.com/domain-name-services/domain-information-center/idn-domains/scripts-languages/index.html ".COM / .NET Internationalised Domain Names Information") (e.g. Arabic, Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese or Japanese) as it is already possible for [.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial ".COM Domain") and [.NET](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network ".NET Domain") web addresses.
