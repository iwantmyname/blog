It's often the little tools that make the services we love really useful. Therefore we've added another way to check domain availability at iWantMyName. With the domain search bookmarklet you can **select any word or text in a browser window and click on the bookmarklet to check whether the respective domain is available or not**.

To install the domain search bookmarklet you just have to drag the following link to your bookmarks bar:

~~Domain Search~~
