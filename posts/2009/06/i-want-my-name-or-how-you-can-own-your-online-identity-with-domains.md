There's a lot of buzz around the [Facebook Vanity URL launch](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130) this weekend where you will be able to register your username such as facebook.com/username instead of having a long profile address. Of course it will be nice to have your name on Facebook, we will try and get [our names](https://iwantmyname.com/about) too. But [not everybody is excited](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/not_everyone_is_excited_abot_facebook_vanity_urls.php) and the whole story shows the dilemma that people are facing when it comes to owning who you are online. Do you really want Facebook (or MySpace, Twitter, etc.) to be your primary address identifier for other people? All these services are currently [battling](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/06/09/facebook-usernames-and-the-battle-over-your-digital-identity/) over your identity but what if you don't like Facebook anymore [in 2 years](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/06/the-future-of-facebook-usernames.html), the [Twitpocalypse](http://archived.link/http://www.twitpocalypse.com/) is upon us or MySpace mysteriously vanishes?

**The answer to these questions is simple: Own your personal domain name!**

Domains are around [since 25 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics) (!) now and there's no sign that they will go away anytime soon. **A domain name is the only address that you can really own and control**. You **[register](https://iwantmyname.com/)** it, you pay for it and you **[use it the way you want](https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns)**. It's as simple as that. And even if you are not planning to use it right now, it's really a must have for every internet user.
