Offering an **easy domain registration service** was one of the main reasons why we've built iWantMyName. How many times have you been to your current domain provider and just wanted to buy a domain name but were presented with tons of different options, special offers or hosting plans that you really do not need at all? Maybe you even gave up completely because you didn't know what to do?

We are focussed on an easy domain registration process **without all these hassles**. This process starts on our home page where you will find only a search box and a few links (which completely disappear when you're logged in). The streamlined process continues with a search result page that brings you directly to the shopping cart without offering you unwanted additional products and ends with a simple confirmation page to finish your order. It's 3 steps in total and only takes 30 seconds as you can see in the following video:
