The sudden shutdown of popular URL shortener [tr.im](http://tr.im "tr.im URL shortener") was already covered by the [main](http://mashable.com/2009/08/09/trim-shuts-down/ "tr.im on Mashable") [tech](http://archived.link/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/ "tr.im on Techcrunch") [blogs](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_hammers_nail_in_coffin_for_trim.php "tr.im on ReadWriteWeb") so we won't go into further details on the business side. In short the main problem resulting from this are the broken links someday and there's only one solution how you can prevent this in the future: **run your own URL shortener**.

Again, it all comes down to [owning your namespace as discussed earlier with Facebook's username landrush](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/i-want-my-name-or-how-you-can-own-your-online-identity-with-domains.html "Own your identity"). **You are only able to fully control what's happening with your links if you own the domain name** and run your own URL shortener on it. Anybody who's considering Twitter as an important part of their business or personal brand should start thinking about customising their short URLs now (also see our [domain hack examples](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html "How to find a domain hack") how they are used to create short links).

We have compiled a list of hosted services, scripts and plugins that make running your custom URL shortener possible:

## Hosted URL shortening services with custom domain##

* [awe.sm](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/url-shortener/awe.sm-hosted-url-shortening-service "awe.sm URL shortener") - A custom URL shortener with API. detailed analytics, uptime guarantee and SLAs. According to their website you can take your data with you anytime.
* [Tinyarro.ws](http://tinyarro.ws "Tinyarrows URL shortening service") - Use a custom domain with Tinyarro.ws' tiny links service. As their own service uses the âž¡.ws domain you should also be able to use [IDNs](https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names "Virtual Keyboard IDN search and registration").
* [budurl](http://budurl.com/ "URL shrinker budurl") - The budurl Enterprise edition offer the possibility to use your own domain. Their dashboard provides extensive analytics and real-time stats.

**UPDATE: 03/02/2010**

Popular URL shortening service bit.ly is now offering a Pro version with custom domain functionality. Read more about [bit.ly Pro for your own domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service) and [how to find a memorable short domain](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/buy-short-domain-name-bitly-pro-custom-url-shortener.html).

Some of you might argue that there's still a risk should one of these services stop to exist but at least you own the domain and can redirect links to another website or landing page.

## Run a URL shortener on your own machine##

* [YOURLS PHP script](http://yourls.org/ "YOURLS - Your Own URL Shortener") - Small set of script to shorten links using a classic PHP and MySQL setup. Also offers an API and a Wordpress plugin.

* [Short URL Wordpress Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/short-url-plugin/ "Short URL Wordpress Plugin") - Create short URLs with this Wordpress plugin. Offers basic analytics and requires Wordpress 2.5 or higher.

* [Movable Type script](http://roub.net/blahg/archives/2009/07/rolling-your-ow.html "Movable Type Short URLs") - Paul Roub's script to create a self-hosted URL shortener for the Movable Type blog software. You need some technical knowledge for this.
