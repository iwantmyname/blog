Yahoo's [Geocities](http://geocities.yahoo.com/ "Geocities") service is about to [close](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/ "Geocities closes") in 2 months and it's getting time to look for an alternative, if you haven't already done it. **Today we'd like to recommend both some free and paid services for hosting your own website.**

But let's start with one basic thing first and that's [**your own domain name**](https://iwantmyname.com/domains "Your own domain name"). A domain should be the foundation for every website because, compared to an internet address like _geocities.com/yourwebsite,_ you have full ownership and control over it. This gives you the advantage of being able to switch to another website hosting service if you become dissatisfied with features, price or customer support.

By seperating the three elements website hosting, email and domain registration you can even further minimise the risk of being caught in another Geocities-like incident. In such a case you simply have to point your domain name to a new hosting service whilst still retaining the same overall branding and email address. Our [Domains For Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns "Domains For Apps") offering can help you to achieve this 3-way setup.

The following 20 services make building a website, blog or community easy. It's worth to take your time and compare their features and prices to find the tool that's best suited for you.
