It is with a huge amount of pride that we announce the launch of two new domain registrar sites:

In conjunction with a [great partner](http://xxlwebhosting.nl "XXL Webhosting") in the Netherlands we've created **[Benikvrij](http://benikvrij.nl "Benikvrij") (**Am I free), a Dutch language version of our service. With all the functionality of our existing site, local web apps, plus full Euro currency integration Benikvrij introduces the iWantMyName platform to one of the largest domain markets in Europe.

But we aren't just stopping there. We've also opened a wholly owned and operated German language domain registrar site and we called it simply [**meinName**](http://meinname.com "Mein Name") (my name).

The German language site is a special achievement because [ideegeo](http://ideegeo.com "ideegeo") in part has its origins in an idea that began in Germany. So meinName is a little bit like a return home for us.

The new sites demonstrate how we can powerfully leverage the underlying platform technology behind iWantMyName and how we can make other partnerships work in new markets. Expect to see further rollouts and cool new services in the future as we change the face of domain name management.
