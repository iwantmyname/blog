title: 6 Free DNS Hosting Services For Your Domain Names

categories:
  - DNS

---

One of our core philosophies at [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com "Domain") is openness. For example, we we don't force you to use our nameservers and DNS hosting services for your domain names. It might even make perfect sense to seperate [domain registration](https://iwantmyname.com/domains "Register Domain") and DNS hosting in some cases. That's why you can always update the nameservers of your registered domains in real-time through your online dashboard to host it somewhere else.

There are many free DNS hosting services out there and depending on the level of service or amount of domains (some of them offer paid account upgrades) they might already be sufficient for your needs. Some of the most popular ones are:

*   [ZoneEdit.com](http://www.zoneedit.com) (5 domains free)
*   [EveryDNS.net](http://www.everydns.com) (from OpenDNS founder [David Ulevitch](http://david.ulevitch.com/))
*   [editDNS.net](http://free.editdns.net) (free for up to 5 domains)
*   [XName.org](http://www.xname.org) (non-commercial)
*   [FreeDNS](http://freedns.afraid.org) (unlimited domains, 20 subdomains)
*   [Zerigo](http://www.zerigo.com/managed-dns) (also integrates with [Heroku](http://addons.heroku.com/zerigo_dns))
