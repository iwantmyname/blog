title: Ugh, invalid username/password

[From Kevin Burke:](https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/invalid-username-or-password-useless/)

>So what we've done by promoting "Invalid username or password" is made our login form UX much, much worse, without increasing the security of our product.

>If people don't log in to your site every day (every site on the web except Facebook or Google), not remembering credentials is a huge barrier to accessing your site. Don't make it harder by adding a vague error message that doesn't increase your site's security at all.

>But there's a tradeoff there between security and UX, I hear you say. I am trying to show you there is no tradeoff, as presented above; you are choosing between a better user experience and a worse user experience.
