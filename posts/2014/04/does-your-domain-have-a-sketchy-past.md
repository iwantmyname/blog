title: Does your domain name have a sketchy past?

---

<!-- excerpt -->

Let's pretend your website is a child, and it's your sole responsibility to name it. Technically, you could name it anything you want, but like all things, names come with connotations. You probably don't want to name your child after the scam artist next door. And you certainly don't want to name it after a village plunderer.

So do your research. Here's a little video guide from Matt Cutts of Google Webmasters on how you can protect yourself from registering domain names with iffy histories.

To recap, here are his three three main tips:

1. Do a "site: DOMAINNAME.com" search. If you see anything fishy, be weary.
2. Search for the domain name without the domain extension. So instead of "site: DOMAINNAME.com", just search for "DOMAINNAME." You never know what you might find. 
3. Search for your desired domain on [archive.org](https://archive.org/). If your site used to be a scam site, you could suffer a continued SEO hit. Also note that if your site used to be something you find unsavory, you may get residual unsavory emails.
