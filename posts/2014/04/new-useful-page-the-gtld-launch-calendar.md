title: "New useful page: The gTLD launch calendar"
excerpt: no
---

It started with a [big list](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions). And we were quite pleased with our big list, but it needed more context. So we built categories and buckets for released and about-to-be-released gTLDsâ€”and it worked out great. But one more thing was needed. 

We needed a way to show all the gTLD launch information we know, and we needed it to update automatically so it wouldn't require insane amounts of time to manually maintain. So we built it, and we're really happy with how it turned out. 

Say hi to our new [gTLD launch calendar](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates). It has launch dates and prices for all the gTLDs we have information on, and it's quite easy on the eyes. 

Pre-orders for all listed gTLDs are open until the launch date given, so get your domain on the list before it's open to the public.
