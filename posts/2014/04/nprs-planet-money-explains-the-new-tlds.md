title: NPR's Planet Money explains the new top-level domains
excerpt: no

---

I'm a bit of a rabid podcast listener, and like any fan of a given medium, I have lots of opinions. I like Downcast more than any other podcast app, I like story driven shows over freeform conversations, and I really love NPR's Planet Money. 

And this week's Planet Money, titled "The Wild West Of The Internet," was right up my alley:

> There are over 100 million websites ending in .com. But new options for website names are becoming available. Not only is there .com and .gov .edu, but now .ninja has been added. Also .bike, .plumbing and .cool. In all, over 1,000 new top-level domains, as they are called, will be added.
>
> Today on the show, what happens when you just create a whole bunch of real estate out of nowhere? We meet some of the new land barons with big dreams. And a guy who worries it's just going to be a big mess.

If you're a fan of the show, or just want to get a better grasp on what's going on with these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), [give this episode a listen](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/16/303735386/episode-532-the-wild-west-of-the-internet). I think you'll enjoy it.
