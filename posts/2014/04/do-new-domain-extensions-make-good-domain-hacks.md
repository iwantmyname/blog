title: Do the new domain extensions make good domain hacks?

<!-- excerpt -->

First, a definition. In short, a domain hack is a trick to use a top-level domain (TLD) as part of the word. So, instead of using WORD.COM, you'd use WO.RD.

Traditionally, domain hacks have been used with country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like .IO in rad.io and .ES in watch.es. And amongst the right crowd, they worked because:

A. If you use a short, common word/phrase like "radio," it's easy to remember. 
B. Even if you didn't remember what the TLD is, you knew to put the dot before the last two letters, because aside from .COM and a few others like .INFO, all the domain extensions were two letters. So "radio" is rad.io and "watches" is watch.es.

Basically, if you knew your audience was savvy enough to not automatically add .COM to the end of everything, domain hacks were great. But then came the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). 

In an [article](http://www.thedomains.com/2014/04/20/how-many-letters-on-to-the-right-of-the-dot-is-too-many-to-be-a-hack/) titled "How Many Letters On To The Right of the Dot is Too Many To Be A Hack? [sic]," The Domains listed domains like hollywoodreal.estate and palmbeachreal.estate as domain hacks and asked if they were too long.

<!-- /excerpt -->

To me though, the question is not if they are too long, it's that they may wreck the understanding internet users currently have. As I said earlier, the current understanding is that the dot will come directly before the last two letters of the word. But as a user, how do you navigate something like this:

+ Company name: iPhone Reviews
+ Possible domain hack 1: iphonerevie.ws
+ Possible domain hack 2: iphone.reviews

Five letter TLDs, three letter TLDs—the introduction of anything other than two letters introduces doubt to the equation, and that's tricky. Do you use .TIRES as a domain hack for something like chrisre.tires, when it could get confused with chrisretir.es? Will you ever be confident enough to know that any strange combination of letters isn't a gTLD? 

###Expect to see far fewer domain hacks

Instead of getting lost in confusion, I think it's important to think of why people used domain hacks in the first place. 

Aside from being cool, domain hacks opened up a whole new universe of possible TLDs to use (.ES, .IO, .IT). They let you break free from the clutches of .COM—which is exactly what the hundreds of [new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) are intending to do. 

And now, instead of having to explain a ccTLD domain hack to someone, you can probably just replace it with a gTLD. So this...

+ "My email address is hello at Dave dot ventures." 

Instead of this...

+ "My email address is hello at Daveventur dot es. That's Daveventures with no dot com. Just put the dot before the ES."

With these new namespaces now open, I think we'll see far fewer domain hacks in the future. You'll still see them here and there because they're fairly fun to dream up (chrisre.tires was a pretty good one, if maybe a few decades premature), but the necessity seems to be coming to an end.
