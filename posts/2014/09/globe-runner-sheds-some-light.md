There was a time not so long ago when the domain selecting process was as easy as finding a short, available name that sounded good. But then came the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). Do you go with the shortest, most brand-centric domain name in the .COM space now or do you get the exact name you want in a new gTLD like .CLUB, .LINK, or .TODAY? It's a big question that everyone in the space is asking, and now there's some data to help make your decision.

<!-- /excerpt -->

From Globe Runner's article "[Search Engine Marketing Study: .Com Vs. New gTLDs](http://globerunner.com/com-vs-new-gtld/)"

>Our overall goal when setting up these tests was ultimately to determine whether using a .Com domain name or a new gTLD domain name is better when it comes to search engine marketing and Google AdWords. We are not totally convinced that one is necessarily “better” than the other.
>
>What we did see, though, is that Google AdWords tends to favor the new gTLDs, as they served up more impressions, for less cost, and a better average position then the .Com domain names we used. 

In short, if you're a google AdWords user, it'll generally cost you less to get more impressions with gTLDs than with .COM. But the other aspect of the study is conversions. The study ran two tests, one with a .DIAMONDS site vs. a .COM and one with a .MENU site vs. a .COM.

***

###.DIAMONDS

>There were more conversions on the .com domain name for both the download of the PDF file and for clicks on the “Shop Diamond Rings” button on the site, and the total conversion rate was higher on the .Com domain name than it is on the .Diamonds domain name. So while the Google AdWords tends to favor the new gTLD domain name, consumers appear to favor the .Com (we saw nearly a 20 percent better conversion rate on the .Com domain name).

###.MENU

>The CTR was actually better and cheaper using the .Menu domain name. Also, the average position of our ads using the .Menu domain name was better (it was higher) than the .Com. So it was clear to us that Google AdWords actually prefers the .Menu domain name over the .Com.

***

So this brings up a big point for me—not all gTLDs are equal. And it has nothing to do with the gTLD itself, but of the clientele you're trying to reach. People tend to be much more conservative when large amounts of money are on the table, and trying to lure someone in to buy diamonds online with a .DIAMONDS domain name seems screams of a potential scam. But .MENU, especially when attached to a restaurant people already know, presents no threat at all. If I were a local business depending on matching branding for discoverability, I'd absolutely go with a new gTLD if the .COM was already taken.

Be sure to read through the [whole report](http://globerunner.com/com-vs-new-gtld/) though to see the entirety of the test. If your marketing relies on Google AdWords or PPC marketing, the results may be quite useful.
