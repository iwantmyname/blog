<!-- excerpt -->

2014 is finally here, and with it comes a bundle of resolutions bound to be broken by Spring (I seriously don't think my "cut down on dessert" thing will last very long).

But if your resolution is to start a new website, we've got your back. In addition to [continuing our sale](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer) on [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory), [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) and [.CO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) ($49, $19.90 and $15.50 respectively), we have two additional extensions that might be perfect for what you're looking for.

<!-- /excerpt -->

+ **[.CA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada)** - Canada. The [most polite country](http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/25958) on Earth, and perhaps the future birthplace of your next domain. .CA domains are fantastic for businesses and personal sites in Canada, and can make for great domain hacks if you're feeling clever. Something like colderameri.CA or delicioustapio.CA might do the trick. Or perhaps you're starting a fan club for the movie Casablan.CA? Either way, .CA domains are on sale this month for $15.50, down from $19.

+ **[.ASIA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia)** - .ASIA is an interesting generic domain extension because it fully spells out a place. And with Asia already being one of the most popular search keywords on the web, having a .ASIA address might be your ticket to enhanced visibility. Grab yours this month for $15.50, down from $24.90.

And from all of us here at iwantmyname, we hope you had a wonderful New Year. Here's to 2014 being the best year yet.
