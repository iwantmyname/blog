It's looking like big year ahead for the iwantmyname crew. Apart from adding a few more staff in 2014 and getting out in the community a bit more, we are also well advanced with our preparations for the global roll-out of hundreds of newly released top level domains.

<!-- more -->

We've already been offering customers the opportunity to [register interest in the new domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions). On the local front, we have also been seeing increasing activity around both the [.kiwi domain](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-kiwimore-gtlds-coming-soon.html) and the new [second level .nz domain](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/its-time-to-drop-the-conz-pre-ordering-starts-today.html). If you are a business owner, then it's time to start thinking about how these new domains fit into your brand strategy.

On the technical side, we've already begun work on improving our [domain name search](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) function, making it easier and faster to search for your favourite domain from over 100 extensions on offer. That work opens the door for some long awaited improvements to our customer dashboard. As always, we value [feedback](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) from our mates, so we can make your domain registration experience even better. 

We already support a lot of events and local initiatives across the New Zealand tech community, but expect to see us out and about more often this year. We've just helped to launch a [Docker Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Wellington/), we'll be shouting beers for [Hackers &amp; Founders](http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/), [PHP Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/) and the [Growth Hacker Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/). February is looking busy too with [Wellington Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) and [Drupal South](https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/). 

There will be some noticeable changes here on our blog too, as we will be merging our New Zealand blog with the new and improved international blog shortly. But don't worry, we will still be reporting local interest stories. Stay tuned!
