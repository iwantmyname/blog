<!-- excerpt -->

Customer support may be the single most important aspect of our (and any) business. It's so important to us, in fact, that [all of us](https://iwantmyname.com/about) dedicate a considerable amount of time to answer questions and help out. And with [99% customer happiness](http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname) over the 6+ months we've been measuring support satisfaction, we'd like to think we've been doing a good job. 

But in order to grow and improve, we need help. Specifically, we need someone to:

+ Reply to inquiries via [email](https://iwantmyname.com/support) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iWantMyName) from all over the world
+ Add to and maintain our [Support Center](http://help.iwantmyname.com/)
+ Work with the team to improve our overall customer experience

And because we're based in Wellington, NZ, we're specifically looking for someone to take over the opposite side of the globe--EST, the east coast of North America. Or a European location if you don't mind working later in the day.

So if you're super smart, like to teach (and learn) and feel good about working in your pajamas every day (totally optional), head over to our [jobs page to find out how to apply](https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/customer-support).
