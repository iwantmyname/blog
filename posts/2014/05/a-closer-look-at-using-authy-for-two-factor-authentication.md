title: A closer look at using Authy for two-factor authentication

---

<!-- excerpt -->

Yesterday I [went over](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/a-practical-look-at-using-iwantmynames-two-factor-authentication.html) using a setting up two-factor authentication, so now lets do a quick dive into Authy itself. Specifically about what it is, what platforms you can use it on and how the Authy setup works.

###What is Authy?

[From Klint Finley - Wired:](http://www.wired.com/2013/07/authy/)

>Authy is one of several companies working to bring a security technique called “two-factor authentication” to the masses. With two-factor authentication, you provide more than just a username and password when you log into a service. You provide additional credentials, such as a hardware dongle, a fingerprint, or a unique PIN number that was just text-messaged to your phone. That way, even if someone knows your password, they can’t find their way into your stuff.

>But Authy’s service isn’t something you use all on your own. You need help from third-party software developers. The company offers tools that let developers add its two-factor authentication to specific applications. Then, if you use one of these third-party apps, Authy provides another tool that ties into the app and manages your credentials. This tool can also double as a client for Google Authenticator, a similar service from the web search giant.

###Downloading Authy

There are a number of ways you can set Authy up now, including:

+ [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017)
+ [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy)
+ [Google Chrome for Mac, Linux or Windows](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gaedmjdfmmahhbjefcbgaolhhanlaolb)

Authy for Chrome is brand new (here's the [official announcement](http://blog.authy.com/authy-for-pc)), and lets you authenticate all your codes right from your computer. [From Frederic Lardinois - TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/28/authy-brings-two-factor-authentication-to-the-desktop/):

>As the company’s founder and CEO Daniel Palacio told me last week, being able to get your second factor from your desktop and laptop makes for a far more seamless user experience. Instead of typing in a code, you can just copy and paste it from the desktop app. For those users who don’t have a smartphone, this also provides an easier alternative to the usual SMS messages services like Authy utilize to send their codes.

>...

>But doesn’t that defeat the purpose of a two-factor application? Authy — unsurprisingly — claims it doesn’t. “Two-factor authentication is still valid regardless of whether the second authentication factor ‘you have’ comes from your cellphone, your tablet, or right from a desktop app in your laptop,” the company writes in a blog post today. “What really matters, is that it is something only you can have.”

###What the setup looks like

I personally have Authy downloaded on iOS and Chrome, so I'll walk through what the setups looked like.

**iOS**

Once you download the app, you're shown a screen that lets you attach a phone number to your Authy app. Then, to verify that you are the owner of the phone number, you just follow the directions in the screen below.

Now, when you add your number into a platform like iwantmyname, verifications and such will go to the correct device.

**Chrome**

Once you install Authy for Chrome, you're shown a similar screen as the iOS install that lets you enter your phone number. Just add it in, type in the code from the following text and you're good to go.
