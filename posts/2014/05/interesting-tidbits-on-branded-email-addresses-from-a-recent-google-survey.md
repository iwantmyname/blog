title: Interesting tidbits on branded email addresses from a recent Google survey

---

<!-- excerpt -->

There's no magic recipe of apps and tools you should and shouldn't use to guarantee business success, but it seems the days of getting by without branded email addresses are (finally) coming to a close. From a consumer's point of view, a random `@gmail.com` or `@yahoo.com` address will never compare to `@brand.tld`, and the logical connection is that consumer trust weighs heavily in the purchasing process. 

But, in the world of business decisions, sometimes logic needs to be backed up with facts, and the latest [Google survey of young businesses](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/youngbizsurveyreport.pdf) is just what the doctor ordered. Here are some interesting tidbits:

<!-- /excerpt -->

+ "By nearly three to one (60% vs. 23%), those who got a professional email address after they started their business saw an increase in customer engagement."
+ "42% of respondents said they saw an increase in sales after getting a professional email address."
+ "The majority of respondents (59%) said a professional email address has a high impact on customer trust, with half (50%) of respondents saying such an email address has a high impact on having happy customers."
+ "Among consumers surveyed who are more likely to communicate with or buy from a business with a professional email address, 47% said it is because they have more confidence in the businessâ€™ legitimacy."
