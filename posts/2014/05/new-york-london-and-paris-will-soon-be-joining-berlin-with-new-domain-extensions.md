<!-- excerpt -->

It's hard to estimate the potential popularity of any new top-level domain (TLD), but I think it's safe to say that city TLDs are going to be a big deal. [.BERLIN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin)—the first city TLD—is currently the second most popular new TLD available with nearly 50,000 domains registered. And that number will certainly rise once the TLD gains traction with more local businesses. 

Just think about it—if you owned a small business in Berlin, wouldn't it make more sense to use .BERLIN than a generic TLD like .COM or a country-code TLD (ccTLD) like .DE?

<!-- /excerpt -->

And .BERLIN is only the start. The current list of city TLDs currently available for pre-order includes:

+ [.NYC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc)
+ [.LONDON](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london)
+ [.PARIS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-paris)
+ [.TOKYO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo)
+ [.DUBAI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dubai)
+ [.QUEBEC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-quebec)
+ [.SYDNEY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sydney)
+ [.VEGAS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas)
+ [.HELSINKI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-helsinki)
+ [.CAPETOWN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-capetown)

And that's just a sample. In our "City & Regions" [category](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) we have 51 TLDs—all of which have large built-in audiences that, if .BERLIN is any indication, will get onboard fairly quickly. So if you're a local business owner (or savvy resident) in a city getting its own TLD, now is the time to get your name on the pre-order list.
