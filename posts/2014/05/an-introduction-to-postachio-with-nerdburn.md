<!-- excerpt -->

Blog platforms come in all shapes and sizes, but some of the more interesting platforms today are the ones that work without traditional hosting space. And with Evernote recently [topping 100 million users](http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/05/13/evernote-reaches-100-million-users/), we thought it'd be the perfect time to ask cofounder [Shawn Adrian](http://nerdburn.com/) ([@nerdburn](https://twitter.com/nerdburn)) about his Evernote-powered blog platform, [Postach.io](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postachio).

<!-- /excerpt -->

**iwmn:** I'll start with the million dollar question. How does Postach.io/Evernote blogging work? Is it easy to make a site?

**Shawn:** Our whole goal with creating Postach.io was, and still is, to make web publishing easy, with fewer steps. From the feedback we’re getting from people I think we’re on the right track. People love the simplicity.

To make a site, you simply connect your Evernote account, choose a site name, then tag content “published” in Evernote to post to it. It literally takes only couple of minutes to be blogging, quite professionally.

**iwmn:** What does a Postach.io site look like? Are there themes? Do I need to know any code or anything to change things?

**Shawn:** You can check out a bunch of Postach.io sites by visiting our [Discover feed](http://postach.io/discover)—although we need to work on the algorithm that brings interesting content to the top, you’ll see a variety of sites on Discover.

We currently have 13 themes, and all are fully responsive for web and mobile. Right now, to create a theme you need to know HTML and CSS, but we’re working on making it much easier to customize the presentation without code knowledge.

**iwmn:** Is there any disadvantage to Postach.io in terms or SEO?

**Shawn:** Nope, in fact, our customers have shared that by using Postach.io they’ve seen more traffic to their blog posts than before they migrated over. We’ve done a lot to ensure we’re coding our themes according to latest best practices.

**iwmn:** Kind of related to SEO, are there any speed concerns with Postach.io? Is it as fast as a traditional blog hosting platform?

**Shawn:** Feel free to test it! One of our secret fetishes here is building scalable apps. It's a thrill to get hit with a bomb of traffic then see the server handle it without a hiccup. What a rush! We’re confident that Postach.io sites stand up to the best of them when talking about speed.

**iwmn:** Since Postach.io works in Evernote, can I bring in things like social integrations, analytics platforms and comment systems?

**Shawn:** We have a ton of integrations and embeds, but we’re working on more as well. In the coming months you’re going to see even deeper integrations to popular platforms—currently we support Google Analytics, Disqus commenting, SoundCloud, YouTube, Vimeo, Mathjax, Gist, Slideshare and a bunch of others.

**iwmn:**  So the Postach.io [premium tier](http://blog.postach.io/postach-io-premium-announcement) recently came out. What's included? And how much is it?

**Shawn:** It’s $50 a year, and it includes the ability to collaborate on a site with another person, and password protection. It’s a great option for small businesses and teams, or people who want one of our t-shirts, included with every premium subscription :) 

**iwmn:**  What will Postach.io look like in the future? Any big updates in the works?

**Shawn:** Oh man, I’m glad you asked. We proved the concept by launching an Evernote powered blogging platform, but the real magic isn’t specifically in using Evernote, it’s blogging using the tools you love to author content in, like Evernote. 

This summer we’re rolling out support for something like 10 more platforms, so you can write, collect, or capture content in the platform of your choice and it will automatically be live and beautiful on your Postach.io site.

**iwmn:**  Last question, and be honest here. How much do you like pistachio ice cream? Best thing anyone could ever eat?

**Shawn:** You know, I can’t speak for the rest of the team here, but I’m curiously fascinated by pistachio ice cream. It’s not love yet, but the taste is curious and I have a crush. We’ll see where it goes! 

[Gavin](https://twitter.com/geekforbrains), my cofounder, actually thought of our name. He has a habit of waking up in the night with ideas, and this one came to him at 4am. He might be a bigger fan of pistachio ice cream than I am ;)
