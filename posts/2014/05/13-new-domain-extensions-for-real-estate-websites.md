<!-- excerpt -->

Real estate is, and will likely always be, a huge employment sector. But for many real estate agents, the web has just recently become a necessary tool of the trade. These days, websites are the first points of reference for home buyers and the biggest marketing tool any agent will possess. And that makes finding a memorable domain name hugely important.

<!-- /excerpt -->

With a quick Google search, I'm finding that most local agents are using a YOURNAMErealestate.com or YOURNAMErealty.com naming convention. And there's fine, but wouldn't YOURNAME.realestate or YOURNAME.realty be better? That's three characters you can cut from your domain (com), and that can make a big difference when printing business cards, displaying ads or committing names to memory.

So instead of .COM, here are some great new and upcoming generic top-level domains (gTLDs) you could use instead:

###Broad

+ [.BROKER](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-broker)
+ [.REALESTATE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-realestate)
+ [.REALTY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-realty)

###Specific

+ [.CONDOS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-condos)
+ [.FORSALE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-forsale)
+ [.LEASE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-lease)
+ [.MANAGEMENT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-management)
+ [.PROPERTIES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-properties)
+ [.PROPERTY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-property)
+ [.RENT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rent)
+ [.RENTALS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rentals)
+ [.VACATIONS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vacations)
+ [.VILLAS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-villas)

###A few naming tips

This really applies to any industry, but the most important factor when determining a domain name should be memorability. And today, the most memorable sites are short .COMs. The problem many people are running into is that the list of available short .COMs is shrinking, so moving to a newer gTLD like .REALTY can be a good alternative. 

Also, with a newer gTLD, you can often skip the FIRSTLAST.TLD naming convention (chrishall.realty) and move to something a bit shorter like LAST.TLD (hall.realty) because there more domains available. Always play around with your domain name before registering to get the shortest relevant option.
