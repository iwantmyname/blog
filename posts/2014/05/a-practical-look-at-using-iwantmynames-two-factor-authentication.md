In principle, making your online self more secure seems like a no-brainer. Of course you don't want to get hacked. Of course you don't want your identity to be stolen. But at what length are you willing to go to ensure your safety?

One easy (and totally free) step we recommend you take for every platform that supports it is two-factor authentication (2FA). Stripping technical jargon, 2FA basically makes it so that in order to login to your account, you have to type in a code that's only accessable on your phone. So if Hacker X tries to access your account, they'll need the code sitting on your phone to get through. 

It's something we think is really important, so here's a quick look at how to set it up, and what using it looks like:

<!-- /excerpt -->

###The setup

1. Login to your account, then select "Login & Security" under the "Account" dropdown menu
2. Under "Two-step verification" type in your phone number and country code, then download the Authy app for iOS or Android (an SMS text option is available if you're on an unsupported platform).

###Using 2FA

Now that you're all setup, your login will look like this:

![Authy login]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-05-01-authy-login.png)

Just open up your Authy app (or SMS text) and type in the code provided—and that's it. You've quickly—and painlessly—added a second level of security to your iwantmyname account.

###But will this get annoying?

The million dollar question. Yes, adding 2FA will make logging into your iwantmyname account a touch more cumbersome, but we're not a Bitcoin platform you're logging into every day. If you're like me, you probably only mess with your account once a month—or less. And at five seconds per login (the Authy codes expires every 20 seconds, so even if you're slow, it can only take that long), you're only looking at losing a few seconds of your life a month. 

And that's a really small price to pay for peace of mind.
