<!-- excerpt -->

It's no secret that the tech community loves the [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) top-level domain (TLD), and it's been especially popular with our savvy customers. So it delights us to say that .IO is improving in two waysâ€”the price is going down and WHOIS masking is being enabled.

###Reduced price

The new standard price of .IO is **$59 USD**, down from $69 USD. We're still running a .IO registration sale for $49 USD, so the new price reduction will come into play upon renewal. 

###Whois masking

Privacy is a huge concern for many people, but until now, [WHOIS masking](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425) wasn't available for .IO domains. Now, when you enable WHOIS masking from your dashboard, you'll be able to hide your street address, city and phone number from the public (as shown in the image above).

Additionally, we've dropped the price to $59 USD and added WHOIS masking for both [.SH](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sh-domain-name-registration-for-saint-helena) and [.AC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-international-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island), the domain extensions for Saint Helena and Ascension Island. Both make great [domain hacks](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html), so get brainstorming!
