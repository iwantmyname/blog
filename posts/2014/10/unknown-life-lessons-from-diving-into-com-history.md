I may be promoting everything that's wrong with the internet today, but I kind of love a good list. And today I came across a great one—a list of the 100 oldest .com domain names, which go all the way back to March 15, 1985. Here are the first ten, from [Domain Holdings](http://www.domainholdings.com/recent-sales/100-oldest-domain-names/):

1.	March 15, 1985 - Symbolics.com
2.	April 24, 1985 - BBN.com
3.	May 24, 1985 - Think.com
4.	July 11, 1985 - MCC.com
5.	September 30, 1985 - DEC.com
6.	November 7, 1985 - Northrop.com
7.	January 9, 1986 - Xerox.com
8.	January 17, 1986 - SRI.com
9.	March 3, 1986 - HP.com
10.	March 5, 1986 - Bellcore.com

Further down the list you get a who's-who of major tech companies: IBM.com, Intel.com, GE.com, AMD.com, Tandy.com, Apple.com. It's an interesting list, but thinking of what the world was like in 1985, I was craving context. The stories behind the domains that were registered before Tim Berners-Lee even conceived of a "World Wide Web." So I headed to [symbolics.com](http://symbolics.com/) to see what I could find (did the site still exist?). 

First off, it's a strange site, clearly not related to the old [Symbolics, Inc.](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Symbolics) in any way, with an odd, side-scrolling homepage that showed little in the way of content. So I went to the FAQ to find out what's up, and this little gem appeared.

+ Q. What is the point of this site?
+ A. To offer curious Internet visitors an interesting way to navigate through historic Internet facts.

Huh. Next stop, the about page. At the top, it calls out that the site is now owned by a "small investor group" in Dallas, TX, and that there are advertising opportunities available (on the home page I'm guessing). But the story that follows makes it clear that the owner, Aron Maystedt, is really just hanging onto the domain because it's a collectible—like a first-edition book. Or perhaps the *first ever* book. Here's [the story](http://symbolics.com/about-symbolics/):

>So. How did I come to own the first domain name registered on the Internet? Symbolics.com was registered on March 15, 1985. I was 5 years old. I like to tell everyone that I had incredible foresight as a toddler. But that’s not the case.

>Let me tell you a bit about the Symbolics Computer Corporation. These are the people who registered the name in 1985, and they were a company way ahead of its time.

>The original Symbolics company pioneered computer development. Symbolics designed and manufactured a line of Lisp machines, single-user computers optimized to run the Lisp programming language. The Lisp Machine was the first commercially available “workstation” (although that word had not yet been coined). Symbolics also made significant advances in software technology, and offered one of the premier software development environments of the 1980s and 1990s.

>Enter me, in 2009. I had always known (well, since the late 90s) that Symbolics.com was the first domain name registered on the Internet. It was a goal of mine to acquire one of the first few names ever registered. I know that others before me had reached out to Symbolics, and inquired about the purchase price of the domain name. For whatever reason, my timing was perfect (thank you Lord) and I contacted Symbolics right about the time they actually started considering selling the asset.

The story was amusing, but it didn't have any of the wonder of being the first one to register a domain name. I thought I'd try to find something at the "new" [Symbolics site](http://www.symbolics-dks.com/), but no luck. Nothing to be found. SF Gate did run a good article back in 2010, titled "[25 years of .com domain names](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/25-years-of-com-domain-names-3270287.php)", where they contacted the Symbolics founders for the story. Unfortunately, they "didn't even remember the event."

How funny is that. They registered the very first .com, and it didn't even register in their memories. There's a lesson in there somewhere, I just don't know what it is yet.
