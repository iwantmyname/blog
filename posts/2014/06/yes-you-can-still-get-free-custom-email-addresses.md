There was a time when you could easily get free custom email addresses through Google, but those days have come and gone. Now if you want to set up a name@yourdomain.tld email address, you have to pay up like you're a business. Multiple users, vast amounts of space, tons of add-ons. But if you're just looking for something small that may or may not ever grow, having a freemium option is ideal. And for that, you should check out Zoho Mail.

In short, Zoho Mail offers [just about everything](https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing2.html) gmail does, including lots of space, document storage and integration with productivity tools like calendars and task lists. Zoho Mail also has a webmail interface that works surprisingly well, and can easily be added to your favorite mail app for a more personalized workflow. Best of all though is the aforementioned free tier, with 5GB mail and document storage for up to 10 users (and it's ad-free).

##Setting up your custom email address

Once you're ready to get started with Zoho Mail, the setup is quite simple. First, head to your iwantmyname dashboard and select **Apps & Services** under the **Setup** menu. Under the **Mail** category, you'll see [Zoho Mail](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite) (or just type in Zoho Mail in the search field). From there, just add it to your domain and click **Install Zoho Mail**.

Now that the domain is set up, head to [Zoho Mail](http://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html) and select **Get Started**. Then, after you type in all the information needed, you're on to verifying ownership of your domain.

As you can see in the screenshot below, just select **TXT Method** and click **Verify**. Since you already have your domain configured, everything should go through without a hitch.

That's it! You now have your very own custom email address (it may take a while to start working, so hang tight if it's not instant). And as always, if you have any questions about the install, just let us know via our [support](https://iwantmyname.com/support) channel.
