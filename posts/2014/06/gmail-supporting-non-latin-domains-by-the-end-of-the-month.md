<!-- excerpt -->

[From John Yunker - Global by Design:](http://www.globalbydesign.com/2014/06/26/gmail-non-latin-email-addresses/)

> At the ICANN 50 conference Jordyn Buchanan of Google confirmed that Gmail would support EAI (email address internationalization) by the end of this month.

> I don’t have the details yet, but at a minimum I assume it means a Gmail user could create an email address using a non-Latin label, such as [RussianName]@gmail.com. And this address would work with others on the Gmail platform, though not other email platforms. And this is not because Google doesn’t want to work with other platforms, but because there are so many mail servers involved in successfully delivering email.

>But assuming that this is full EAI support, then the user could also use a complete non-Latin email address, such as [RussianName]@[RussianDomain].

The internet has changed quite a bit with the launch of the new [generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), and buried amongst all the news of [.xyz](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz) and [.club](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) is the success of [.在线](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF), the Chinese TLD for 'online'. With [more than 33,000 domains registered](http://namestat.org/), it's the seventh most popular extension currently available—and that's without the ability to be widely used for email, one of the most essential tools of the modern web. 

It's all changing though, and at the end of the month we'll be seeing Gmail (and likely [Google Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain) email addresses as well, or soon after) in an assortment of languages. And making the internet more accessible for everyone is certainly a good thing.
