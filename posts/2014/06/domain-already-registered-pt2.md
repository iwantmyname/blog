<!-- excerpt -->

As mentioned in [the previous part of this post series](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html), you can look for a variant of "theperfectdomain". But be aware of potential confusion if the domain extension (e.g. .NET / .GURU / .CA) is the only difference between your domain and someone else's.

You could try small changes to the domain name you want. Like adding or dropping an article. Instead of "companyname", use "thecompanyname" or "getproductname". Again, there is still a good chance people will get confused.

Instead of directly referring to your company, group, or topic name, you could focus on something relevant and important, like what the product or service enables you to do. A photographer could register a domain using "shoot" or "snap", or referencing "memories". A group of pilots could use "fly" or "wings" or "soar". Using slang or terminology common among your group could make for a memorable domain name as well.

You could use one of the new gTLDs to hack the domain and create an interesting and relevant phrase. For example, if you had wanted to register "bobsphotos.com", but it was taken, instead you could register "bobs.photos". Or "mydoma.in".

Another consideration is where you or your organization is located geographically. Should you go local with your identity, or embrace the international nature of the Internet? Should you use a gTLD or a ccTLD? ccTLDs are country code top-level domains, and are all two-letter domain extentions representing countries or regions, e.g. [.FR](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france) for France or [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) for Indian Ocean.

You can use a ccTLD to represent yourself or organization geographically, being proudly Canadian ([.CA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada)) or Belgian ([.BE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium)) or Japanese ([.JP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/jp-japanese-domain-name-registration-for-japan)). Or you can use a ccTLD for one of the aforementioned domain hacks.

Google now treats 20 ccTLDs as generic, i.e. like they were among the hundreds of three-letters-or-longer gTLDs. Familiar ones include .CO, .ME and [.TV](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu). [Here is the current full list.](http://www.thedomains.com/2013/05/02/the-20-cctlds-that-google-treats-as-generic-tlds/)


## How do I get my domain/site to rank better in search results?

What you want to do is improve your site's Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

If you're registering a domain name similar to an existing site that has the domain name you wanted, be aware that the other site has been online longer and become more established. It will take a while and some effort before your site could rank well (and possibly better) in search results.

The way it works is that search engines like Google use an algorithm to determine how websites should rank for any given search term. For example, if you search for a company name (e.g. one used in that domain name), Google looks at all the pages on the Internet that are the most relevant relating to that name. That could include websites, news articles, blogs, etc.

As a site becomes more active, develops more content, and gets more engagement (i.e. people visiting, sharing links to its articles, etc.) it becomes more currently relevant. The odds that that information is what a searcher is looking for increase. 

Then the search ranking starts to change. Given a bit of time, the site could even start to show up on searches that don't involve the name, but for topics and terms it covers well. [Read more about Search Engine Optimization](http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo).

It's important to note that Google's systems are very smart, and are continually improved to guard against scams and gaming the system. Stuffing content with keywords relevant to your site or creating links to your site's content all over the Internet won't work to improve your search rankings, because Google's algorithms are very good at distinguishing _quality_ links and references from scammy ones.
