title: Three tips for making the most of the new TLD pre-order period

---

<!-- excerpt -->

Even with hundreds of new Top-Level Domains (TLDs) coming out in the coming months, it's inevitable that more than one person will want some specific domain names. For example, I'm fully aware that there will likely be a big rush to get christhedomain.doctorâ€”but with these three tips, I'm ready for the launch, and hopefully you will be too.

### Tip 1: Have a backup plan

Even if you think your domain is entirely unique, have a backup plan. Especially if you're depending on this domain for personal or professional branding. 

Also keep in mind that many generic keywords are being sold for premium prices through the registries directly (such as .KIWI's premium domain page, [found here](https://dot-kiwi.com/premiumnames)). With a little creativity though, you should easily be able to find a similar domain with minimal search loss.

### Tip 2: Explore other [gTLDs](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425299-what-is-a-gtld-)

In the past, it was easy to feel trapped with a limited selection of domain extensions. Now though, if you can't get your desired .PHOTO domain, you can just go with .PHOTOS, .PHOTOGRAPHY or .PICS. There are [plenty of domain extensions to choose from](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), so explore your options.

### Tip 3: Make sure you're prepared

If everything works out right and you get your domain, you're going to need accurate account details. Please note that if you get a new card or something changes, change it in your iwantmyname account ASAP. Inaccurate details can prevent you from getting your domain.
