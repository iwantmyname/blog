If you search the web long enough, you'll find quite a few opinions of the new gTLD rollout. Some think it's a moneymaking scheme. Some question the public interest. 

But let's put the cynicism aside for a moment. .COM was the de-facto champ in the domain race because it was first one dedicated for commercial use. But in addition to becoming scarce (all the four-letter options are gone), .COM is quite generic. It doesn't categorize nationalities. Or industries. Or groups. It's just a generic catch-all that, today, is the de-facto web standard. 

In short, this new gTLD rollout is a grand experiment. An experiment to see if the public is ready for change. So we reached out to Desiree Boxberger of [.UNO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-uno) to answer a few questions about their vision and what the future holds. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

**.UNO is quite different from many other gTLDs because it's not a categorical phrase, meaning it has no built-in target audience. What kinds of businesses and brands do you see adopting your gTLD?**

.UNO is a new domain with broad appeal and offers substantial cultural and linguistic relevance in both the Spanish and Italian languages. .UNO means "one" but it also means "first," "best," and "unity" when used in context. Our primary market consists of 490 million Spanish-speaking people around the globe. 

.UNO serves to unite Spanish-speakers in one easy-to-remember place and provides a dedicated space to find information, shop and collaborate in their language of choice and comfort. In simple, .UNO = Spanish.  

**One thing we hear a lot about these new gTLDs is, "why?" We're big fans of the namespace expansion at iwantmyname, but why does the world need new TLDs in your eyes?**

We fully support ICANN's expansion of the domain name system and believe it will spark renewed interest, drive innovation and further expand global eCommerce opportunities. Finding a short, memorable and relevant domain name, in the traditional 22 top level domains, is near impossible. Why? Because they are either:

1. registered and unavailable
2. registered and the owner wants to sell at a high price
3. available and not desirable or valuable
 
A domain name is absolutely key to success on the Internet and small businesses starting out just can't afford to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a short, memorable and relevant domain name. At .UNO, we offer a renewed opportunity to secure a short, memorable and relevant domain name for much less.

**The internet is booming right now in Latin America, and as we know, new users means new sites. Do you think .UNO could ever replace .COM as the TLD of choice for Latin American users? Is that even the goal?**

We certainly would welcome being the #1 choice for a top level domain in Latin America; however, we're not about replacing other types of domains. We believe many users, in Latin America and elsewhere, will continue to use their existing domains but in different ways.

For example, if a business has a .com they may use that for strictly their English site, add a .UNO for a Spanish site, and use or add a country-code domain for in-country search results, depending on their location. Each domain serves an intended purpose and gone are the days where one domain covers all areas of your business. Our focus is to really expand choice and at an affordable price.  

We believe .UNO will be well positioned for adoption in Latin America because of its relevance to the culture, the language and the ability to globally transact commerce outside country borders under the unification of a common language, Spanish.  

With .UNO, it's now "Press 1" for Spanish on the Internet.  

**As far as marketing goes, how does a TLD like .UNO get into the general lexicon? Will it be a slow rise or are there plans in the works to get sites to switch over?**

We are simultaneously driving a top-down bottom-up marketing approach. We are actively engaged with large corporations in the U.S., who have Hispanic initiatives, to drive adoption of a .UNO domain name for their Spanish language website. We're also talking with Hispanic Chambers' of Commerce and Hispanic owned small businesses about the benefits of using a .UNO domain name as a Spanish language website and how to increase SEO results with Spanish content. We are working with Hispanic and Latino celebrities and we're attending key Hispanic social events to drive wide spread awareness with consumers and individuals. 

Organic builds are never easy but we're fully committed and determined to globally spread the word, drive adoption and change the world with .UNO. 

**What is the future of .UNO? In 5 years, where do you think the TLD will be?**

Because .UNO is one of the first new domains to hit the market, it will take time to build general awareness in order to drive adoption and use. This will be a challenge for all new top level domain registries as they map out their go to market strategy. 

Our forecasts indicate that .UNO will have about 2 million domains under management by year five. We believe this is a conservative estimate based on the size of our market segment and anticipated popularity as awareness spreads and interest grows. With Hispanic populations growing at one of the fastest rates, coupled with the fact that Hispanics are technology adopters, we believe .UNO is well positioned to be very successful.
