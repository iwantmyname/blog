Chat log from this morning:

> **Timo:** It's great to see new TLDs being ordered together with traditional ones. -short pause- Traditional TLD sounds odd.
>
> **Lenz:** post apocalyptic TLD world
>
> **Timo:** post .com era

This morning, the first of the new gTLDs officially went live, making [.BIKE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike), [.CLOTHING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing), [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru), [.HOLDINGS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holdings), [.SINGLES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-singles), [.PLUMBING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing), and [.VENTURES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ventures) the official firsts for the rapid expansion of the internet namespace. And while the launch isn't exactly a trip to the moon, we're so excited about it that a few of us didn't sleep last night (Lenz' sleep tracker counted 2hr 31min).

As far as kinks go, we found a few (as expected), but things have gone rather well. Best of all, orders are going smoothly for the most part, and we're learning a ton for our next launch. One specific thing we've found is that the pre-order system is still a bit vague—so we've written a nice [support article outlining the process](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1439307-how-does-the-gtld-pre-order-process-work-). It's certainly a work in progress, so if anything is still unclear, please [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).

### The leader (so far)

Out of the seven gTLDs that came out today, the clear leader in registered domains (so far) is .GURU, with more than three times the popularity of the next highest TLD, .BIKE. I suppose it makes sense though—we've always known our customers are the smartest domain buyers on the web. 

Specifically, we're seeing a good number of .GURU domains using:

+ first/last name.guru
+ various beer/coffee interests.guru
+ business/consulting terms.guru
+ how-to tasks.guru

### Our smart folks are also starting ventures

Also holding up quite well is .VENTURES. But again, where you have smart customers, you probably have some awesome startups needing names. Last names, cities and short tech-centric words have been big so far.


### .PLUMBING, a surprising player

One of the most surprising stats we're seeing is that .PLUMBING domains are becoming quite popular. In what typically isn't seen as an earlier tech adopter industry, some savvy plumbers are getting the first jump on the SEO goodness a .PLUMBING domain could provide.

### Very few are holding

In my eyes, .HOLDINGS is the most traditional of these new gTLDS. And traditional industries are known to transition slowly. It'd be nice for .HOLDINGS domains to pick up in pace, but it may take some time for companies to switch over from the more conservative .COM namespace. Only time will tell.

Just because new gTLDs are arriving doesn't mean the pre-order period has stopped. Check out our [gTLD pre-order list](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) and grab a name before it's too late!
