[From Kevin Murphy - Domain Incite:](http://domainincite.com/15707-nominet-names-the-date-for-shorter-uk-addresses)

>Nominet is to start selling .uk domain names at the second level for the first time on June 10 this year.

>The controversial Direct.uk service will enable people to register example.uk names, rather than example.co.uk names.

<!-- /excerpt -->

Let's start with the low-hanging fruit. Second level domain names are great because they strip away complexity. .CO.UK, .ORG.UK, .ME.UK—they just reek of excess (ok, that was a bit dramatic). 

Simply put, domain names look much nicer when they're tidied up. But here's where things get interesting. Say you have a .CO.UK domain you're perfectly happy with.  Instead of being a cool alternative like the new gTLDs, the new .UK domain is a necessity. It's your brand name, simplified.

But at least you have plenty of time to think about it. [From the Dot UK FAQ:](http://www.dotuklaunch.co.uk/faq/how-will-it-work)

>For the vast majority of you who already have a domain with us...we will automatically reserve the equivalent .uk for you for free for five years. At any point during that period you can decide to register the new .uk domain as long as your existing domain continues to be registered to you.

> If your domain name is eligible for the .uk equivalent, but you don’t want to register it, no one else will be able to register it in the five year reservation period. But once the five years are up, the domain will become available to anyone who wants to register it.
