Nine out of ten writers agree—writing is tough. And one of the toughest things writers face is falling into comfort zones. 

Worst of all, it seems that the better you are at your craft, the easier it is to identify that you have flaws. But that doesn't make them any easier to fix. Without an aggressive editor or an angry comment section to pick you apart your flaws, sometimes even obvious weaknesses get overlooked.

So what are solo content creators to do? Enter Hemingway. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

Hemingway has gotten quite a bit of buzz today in the content world because it fills a real gap in content creation. In short, it's a web-based blog editor that picks apart your flaws. 

[From Hemingway:](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

> Hemingway highlights long, complex sentences and common errors; if you see a yellow highlight, shorten the sentence or split it. If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic — try editing this sentence to remove the red.

> Adverbs are helpfully shown in blue. Get rid of them and pick verbs with force instead.
>
> You can utilize a shorter word in place of a purple one. Mouse over it for hints.
>
> Phrases in green have been marked to show passive voice.

As [Dan Nosowitz of the Awl puts it](http://www.theawl.com/2014/02/a-farewell-to-smarms), "It's kind of a dickish website but, like, so was Hemingway."

Basically, if you're a content writer or blogger, you'd be silly not to give Hemingway a chance to pick apart your content. If nothing else, it'll give you a quick look at what you're not doing so well—and that kind of information can be invaluable. 

### Wish list. 

I like Hemingway quite a lot, but there are a few things I'd like to see changed/improved in future iterations:

+ I don't think Hemingway is designed to be a full-featured content editor, but I'd love to see some visual Markdown support. For example, if Hemingway had a built-in Markdown output display, I'd drop Mou in a heartbeat. 
+ There are already hints that a desktop version is in the works, but I hope it happens soon. I just don't know if I will ever be comfortable switching to an entirely web-based content editing platform. Maybe I'm just old.
+ Right now, the only format you can save to is .doc. And that's fine to start, but I'd love to see some .md output with some Dropbox integration. 

### So how did I do?

+ Readability: Grade 8. Hemingway says to "Aim for a grade level less than 10 for bold, clear writing."
+ 2 of 32 sentences are hard to read
+ 3 adverbs. "Aim for 6 or less."
+ 1 word or phrase could be simpler. 
+ 2 uses of passive voice. "Aim for 8 or less"
