Joel here is our newest backend developer, specifically tasked to make our user experience a bit more intelligent. From his mouth to the world, Joel "has a PhD in Ecoinformatics, an obsession with artificial intelligence and consciousness, and aims for the automation of tedious tasks to free up more time for the novel and fun things in life."

Like "pondering and working on machine learning," "efficient graph database technology," and "building electronic art projects that explore the interaction between software and the physical world."

Oh, and he was also an electronic DJ, playing in clubs and festivals around New Zealand and abroad. And is currently learning to juggle, "just like the famous information theorist Claude Shannon."

All in all, he's just a (really really smart) fun guy to be around. So say hi. He's on Twitter [@ferrouswheel](https://twitter.com/ferrouswheel).
