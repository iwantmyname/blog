title: Tumblr gets two-factor authentication

---

<!-- excerpt -->

[From Staff.Tumblr:](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/80583764030/the-smile-of-a-loved-one-your-childhood-blanket)

> The smile of a loved one. Your childhood blanket. A handsome bodyguard to take you in his arms. “Security” can mean a lot of things in this crazy life, but nothing says “security” like Tumblr’s two-factor authentication. It’s available as an option in your [Settings page](https://www.tumblr.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fsettings%2Faccount) as of right now.

> You know how you need two keys to launch a nuclear missile? Two-factor authentication works like that. One key is your password, the other key is your cellular phone, and you need both to access your Tumblr Dashboard.

Basically, if you want to be extra sure your Tumblog is secure—or anything on the web, including [your data at iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/friends-dont-let-friends-go-without-two-factor-authentication.html)—turn on two-factor authentication whenever and wherever you can.

Be safe out there everyone. And kudos to Tumblr for making their sites significantly more secure.
