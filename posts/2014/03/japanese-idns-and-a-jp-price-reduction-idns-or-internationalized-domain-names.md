title: Japanese IDNs, .コム and a .JP price reduction
---

<!-- excerpt -->

IDN's, or Internationalized Domain Names, are probably going to change the internet. No, they *will* change the internet—it's just hard to tell how much. 

Without doing any sort of in-depth usability study, it's easy to see why domains using international characters would be popular in foreign countries. The internet is supposed to be for us all, but it's currently dominated by the latin alphabet.

Well, just recently, Google launched its first Japanese IDN, .みんな (translated to "everyone"), and it's currently the 27th most popular gTLD on [ntldstats.com](http://ntldstats.com/). And soon, .コム will be coming, ironically giving Japanese speakers a transliteration of the web standard—.COM.

As Akram Atallah of ICANN said when announcing the "[Dawn of a New Internet Era](http://blog.icann.org/2013/10/dawn-of-a-new-internet-era/)":

> As more of the world’s developing countries come online it is a given that only a portion of the world’s expanding base of Internet users are native English speakers, so IDNs provide a huge opportunity to increase engagement, commerce and connectivity and represent a bold step forward in the globalization of the Internet.

This is a big deal for the localization of the Japanese internet, and is becoming a big deal for non-english speakers all over the world.

### .JP domains are now a bit more economical

On a similar topic, we're reducing the price of [.JP domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-jp) to $79, reduced from $89. If you're looking to grab a local Japanese domain on the proven .JP namespace, now is a good time to do so.
