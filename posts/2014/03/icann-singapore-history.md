<!-- excerpt -->

The [49th ICANN meeting](http://singapore49.icann.org/en/) officially started today and the community is back in Singapore where internet history was made when new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were approved in 2011. Coincidentally, Singapore was also the location of the first ever ICANN conference in 1999 so there couldn't be a better place to get together again now that [new gTLDs are a reality](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions).

<!-- /excerpt -->

It's always inspiring to see internet veterans like [Steve Crocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker) talking about the early days when he was helping to define protocols for the ARPANET which developed into today's internet as we know it. Or hearing about [Jon Postel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Postel) managing the whole DNS on a little index card.

There is more history being discussed and that is [who will run the internet](http://domainincite.com/16177-who-runs-the-internet-an-icann-49-primer). It was recently announced that the last legal vestige of US control will dissapear in 2015. This transition of [IANA](http://iana.org) (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) from American stewardship to the international community starts today. IANA is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources. The proposed international stewardship could be a multi-stakeholder solution with ICANN, W3C, regional internet registries like RIPE or ARIN, root operators, IETF, ccTLDs and others. This week's discussions will be an important first step towards a truly global and open internet which should not be run by just one country. 

### What else is happening?

New gTLDs are still a big topicâ€”especially their [universal acceptance](https://blog.icann.org/2014/03/the-tld-universal-acceptance-project/):

> Based on practical operational experience, not all systems (e.g. browsers, spam filters, registration databases, user profiles, ISPs, etc.) work seamlessly when new TLDs are added. Users may experience failures in resolution or other issues with newer TLDs, which in turn impacts consumer trust on the DNS. The issue of the Universal Acceptance of TLDs (Top-Level Domains) is critically related to the introduction of new gTLDs, as well as the introduction of IDN ccTLDs.

As we pointed out in our [open letter to web platforms](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/an-open-letter-to-web-platforms-about-gtld-adoption.html), there is still a lot of work to do. Companies like Twitter [have been catching up](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/twitter-is-now-supporting-most-of-the-gtlds.html) but browser support can still be patchy. We are looking forward to attendees from Mozilla, Google and Microsoft [giving us an update on that](http://singapore49.icann.org/en/schedule/mon-tld-acceptance).
