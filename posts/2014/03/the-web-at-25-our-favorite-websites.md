The web is 25 today. A big birthday indeedâ€”but what do you get a good friend who has everything? Cake? A [Mistobox](http://www.mistobox.com/) coffee membership?

After a bit of thought, we decided to pool together all of our favorite websites to create a "best of" list. Some sites are new, some are considered old, but all have played a part in making the internet what it is today.
