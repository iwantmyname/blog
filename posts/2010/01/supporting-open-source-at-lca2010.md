title: Supporting Open Source at #LCA2010
---

After a very wet and stormy weekend here in Wellington it was with a palpable sense of relief that the heavens parted and sunshine once again blessed the city as delegates filed into the Convention Centre for the opening of the [Australasian Linux Conference LCA2010](http://www.lca2010.org.nz/). As locally based event co-sponsors, we are especially keen for visiting delegates to enjoy a taste of the natural environment in our scenic hometown.

So why is a commercial developer of domain registrar software supporting an open source event? Perhaps that question is best answered by our chief technologist Lenz Gschwendtner who will be speaking at the [LCA Miniconf on Parallel Computing](http://multicorenz.wordpress.com/lca2010-miniconf/) 10.30am Tuesday 18th January. Lenz recently wrote an article explaining how we managed to roll out the iWantMyName platform into [three new destination markets](http://archived.link/http://norbu09.org/2010/01/15/3-new-destination-markets-in-some-weeks.html) in the short space of just a few weeks. Being a modular platform, we make use of some fantastic open source projects (such as [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/), [Catalyst](http://catalystframework.org/)) to implement and run the system. But we also give back to the community, by adding various source libraries to CPAN and [GitHub](http://github.com/norbu09) as we extend our skill set and progressively develop the platform further.

The business of open source is an important theme that cuts across the entire conference this year and that is another reason why iWantMyName is supporting this event. We think it's cool that the acceptance of open source technology is growing across business and government in Australia and New Zealand. Not only will it lead to greater business productivity, but it will almost certainly allow much greater innovation and diversity as developer communities flourish. In fact our parent company ideegeo set up an [Erlang user group](http://groups.google.com/group/erlounge-wellington) in 2008 and we are very active in other ICT groups around Wellington. No doubt many new ideas will be born in the conference hallways this week as various global communities come together.

To help these ideas along we are running some great offers on our newly launched [Kiwi iWantMyName site](https://iwantmyname.co.nz). Of course we have a great deal for our homegrown and much loved [.geek.nz](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/geek.nz-geeky-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) domain or if you need a domain for a community project, check out what we can offer for [.org](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation) or [.org.nz](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) domains. For perl hackers we offer [.pl](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/pl-polish-domain-name-registration-for-poland) and for the enthusiasts amongst you [.io](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) (input/output) or [.sh](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/sh-domain-name-registration-for-saint-helena) (shell). Use our domain search to run a name check on over 80 different [domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.co.nz) - the best selection available by far Down Under. Then you can use our great management dashboard to hook your new domain up to any of the popular [hosted services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) we feature such as GMail, Zoho and Blogger. Bingo! Your own customised office within a few minutes.

We are very keen to get feedback on our site and meet some of our customers in person.
