It's all about .ME this month with the launch of a [fun contest](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/win-free-domain) that could give you a refund on the purchase of your own personal .ME domain. People are already making good use of .ME to domain customise their favourite [web services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) such as [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url), [Blogger](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/blogger-blogspot-free-blog-with-own-url) or even [MobileMe](http://archived.link/https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/apple/mobileme-personal-domains). Search and register your favourite name and then configure your shiny new domain using your iWantMyName account dashboard. This video explains [how to set up a domain on Posterous](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) for example.

Not only have we reduced our prices for .ME but it's really simple to [get yourself in the draw](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/win-free-domain) to receive a full refund of the purchase cost of your .ME domain. If you blog, tweet or tumble, just post a link or a message about iWantMyName after you register a .ME domain with us. We will be refunding one lucky customer each weekday throughout August and September.

Tell the world all about what you've got planned for your new domain and mention iWantMyName. You could be our next winner. It's that easy. Everything you need to know can be found [here](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/win-free-domain). But remember you need to [register a .ME domain with iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/me-domain-sale-promo-offer) this month to be in the draw.
