Do you already own your name as a personal domain name? If not, is it because your FirstnameLastname.com was taken? That shouldn't be a reason to dismiss the idea just yet! Today, we show you five great domain alternatives to .COM for your home base on the web:

### 1. .ME Domain

[![.me logo]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-08-26-logo-dot-me-domain.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro)

[.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) has grown in popularity as a personal web address since its launch in 2008. It's officially the country code top-level domain for Montenegro, but what could describe you better online than a nice sounding FirstnameLastname.me for [your own website](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder) on [Flavors.me](https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/customize-flavors.me-website-with-your-own-domain) or [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url)?

### 2. .NAME Domain

[![.name logo]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-08-26-logo-dot-name-domain.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names)

The [.NAME extension](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names) has existed since 2001 and was specifically introduced for individuals. Perfectly suited for your [personal site](https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile), [blog](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting) or [your own email address](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting), e.g. hello@joesmith.name in conjunction with [Google Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain).

### 3. .TEL Domain

[![.tel logo]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-08-26-logo-dot-tel-domain.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication)

Specialized domain to store and share your contact details with others. All data is presented on an [easy and clean website](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/03/your-tel-website-has-a-shiny-new-design.html) that is included with every [.TEL domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication) so you do not need to purchase any additional hosting services.

### 4. .INFO Domain

[![.info logo]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-08-26-logo-dot-info-domain.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information)

Inform people about who you are. [Register a .INFO domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information) to [forward it to other online profiles](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/04/10-most-popular-services-to-forward-your-domain-url-to.html) or a [family wiki](https://iwantmyname.com/services/wiki-hosting) for example. Everything that contains information about you is a perfect fit for your personal .INFO web address.

### 5. .IM Domain

[![.im logo]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-08-26-logo-dot-im-domain.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man)

The [Isle of Man's domain suffix](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man) can be used as short form of "I am". Many family names are still available so you could set up sub domains in the form joe.smith.im for family members. Another idea is to get a .IM domain as a [personal URL shortener](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener) using [free services](https://iwantmyname.com/services/free-hosting) such as [bit.ly Pro](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service) or [Droplr](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/customize-droplr-with-your-own-domain).

As you can see it doesn't always have to be a [.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial), especially for your individual web presence. Of course you can also [register the top-level domain from your country](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) if you do not have any plans to go international with your personal brand. Some countries even have specialized web addresses for individuals such as [.ME.UK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) (United Kingdom) or [.GEEK.NZ](https://iwantmyname.com/geek.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) (New Zealand).

The most important thing is to own your name online and [not to rely on a third party web address](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html) such as facebook.com/username. Be creative in the choice of your personal domain name and check if it is still available with our [domain search](https://iwantmyname.com).
