It's all about .ME this month with the launch of a fun [fun promotion](http://archived.link/https://iwantmyname.com/win-free-domain) that could give you a refund on the purchase of your own personal .ME domain. People are already making good use of .ME to customize their favorite [web services](https://iwantmyname.com/services) such as [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url), [Blogger](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/blogger-blogspot-free-blog-with-own-url) or even [MobileMe](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/apple/mobileme-personal-domains) with their web address.

Not only are [.ME domains on sale](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-domain-sale-promo-offer) but it's really simple to [get yourself in the draw](http://archived.link/https://iwantmyname.com/win-free-domain) to receive a full refund of the registration cost of your personalized domain. If you blog, tweet or tumble, just post a link or a message about iWantMyName after you register a .ME domain with us. We will be refunding one lucky customer each weekday throughout August.

Tell the world all about what you've got planned for your new domain and you could be our next winner. It's that easy. Everything you need to know can be found [here](https://iwantmyname.com/win-free-domain). But remember you need to [register a .ME domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) with iWantMyName this month to be in the draw.
