Today we want to share with you a small branding advice that can be easily applied to your domain names and takes you only 2-3 minutes to set up. Subdomains such as blog.domainname.com or wiki.domainname.com are often used to map domain names to specific services but it's also possible to simply forward them to another web address.
This is how the URL forwardings to your social network profiles could look like:
![blog-forward-social-usernames.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-07-24-blog-forward-social-usernames.png)
For example, you can like iWantMyName on Facebook (please do!) at [**like.iwantmyname.com**](http://like.iwantmyname.com) or follow us on Twitter via [**follow.iwantmyname.com**](http://follow.iwantmyname.com). So should your preferred social network change back to MySpace or Twitter be renamed to Twoogle you don't have to adjust all your links except the new target web address for the subdomains. This makes your link branding completely third-party independent since you have full control over your [own domain name](https://iwantmyname.com).
