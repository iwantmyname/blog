You can now register [.CO domains (Colombia)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) at iWantMyName. The .CO extension is not only the official Colombian country code top-level domain (ccTLD) but also a shorter alternative to [.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial) or other ccTLDs such as [.CO.UK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) (United Kingdom) or [.CO.NZ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) (New Zealand). New domain name registrations are available at an affordable price of $34.90 USD.

So what can .CO stand for? Here are some examples:

*   Company
*   Corporation
*   Community
*   Cooperation

You could also follow Twitter's example which registered the t.co domain name for their [own URL shortener](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener) or have a look at the following lists with domains to get an idea of what's still available after the initial Sunrise and Landrush registration phase:


*   [265 .Co Domains That Weren't Registered in Landrush](http://domainnamewire.com/2010/07/18/265-co-domains-that-werent-registered-in-landrush/)
*   [233 U.S. Cities Over 100,000 Population Available to Register As .CO Domains](http://archived.link/http://www.dotsauce.com/2010/07/18/us-cities-over-100000-population/)

Maybe there's one or the other neat domain hack that's interesting for you too: [words ending with 'co'](http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/co/)

As you can see, many opportunities are still out there, so don't wait too long (the best ones are going fast) and [register your own .CO domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) today.
