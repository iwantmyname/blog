Two of the services recommended in our [web application directory](https://iwantmyname.com/services) offer some valuable insights on how using your own domain name, instead of a sub-domain, can boost your website traffic and / or increase sales. But this is not the only advantage. With a custom domain you also have ownership and [control over your online identity](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html) so that if necessary you could move from one service to another, whilst retaining your branding. On top of that, you can even [change your domain name provider](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) and take your web address with you similar to switching your number between mobile phone companies.

Here is what hosted e-commerce solution [Shopify](http://shopify.com) and social network hosting service [grou.ps](http://grou.ps) are saying about using custom domains:

> "Choose a good domain name for your store. Having your own domain rather than using the subdomain supplied with your store adds credibility and professionalism. Choosing a good name can also increase visitors to your store. When I registered DrChristophersHerbs.com I saw an increase in sales due to the keyword density of the name itself. In fact, 66.74% of my traffic comes from search engines, most of them searching for "dr christophers herbs" which corresponds with my domain name. - Addison Kirk of DrChristophersHerbs.com" - via the [Shopify blog](http://blog.shopify.com/2010/3/15/two-greats-tips-from-store-owners)
> "Fact: our custom domain users generate 4x more traffic than our users who are use the grou.ps domain name." - via [@grou_ps Twitter](https://twitter.com/grou_ps/status/10503117650)

So if you are serious about your online presence, it clearly makes sense to invest in [your own web address](https://iwantmyname.com).
