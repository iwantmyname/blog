title: A Big Thank You For 2010
---

iWantMyName is turning 2 years old in December 2010 and I'd like to personally thank you for supporting us thus far. While our first year was focused on getting everything up and running, the second year has been mainly about improving the stability and performance of iWantMyName. We are now already looking forward to 2011 with further improvements in mind, especially to the dashboard, domain search and overall usability of the site.

We would also love to receive comments from our valued customers. If you have any technical issues or complaints, please [tell us what we can do better](https://iwantmyname.com/support). Also, if you had a good experience, please share with your friends. Every referral and every piece of feedback helps us to build the best experience for domain seekers.

Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable holiday season [from the whole team](https://iwantmyname.com/about) at iWantMyName!
