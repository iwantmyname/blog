Owning a personal or business related domain name is the first step to controlling your identity online. It also makes personally branded material more discoverable, reaching a wider audience.

[Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/) is great blogging platform that lets you easily share stories, images and other digital content with the world. Everything about Tumblr makes setting up and managing a blog easy.  We now have a special custom domain promotion for both new and existing Tumblr users. Simply use [this link](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/tumblr) and we will apply a 20% discount on your domain registration with iWantMyName.

**5 good reasons why you should secure your own domain name for your Tumblr:**

* YourName.com is a shorter web address than `yourname.tumblr.com`
* Use custom email addresses `@yourname.com` with your domain
* Can keep the domain and switch to another service at any time
* Helps you to rank better in Google so that people can find you easily
* And last but not least - you have complete control of your domain name, it's all yours!

With iWantMyName [web services](https://iwantmyname.com/services), it's super easy to register your domain name and set it up for your Tumblr page. Feel free to share this Tumblr custom domain promotion with your friends. All they have to do is visit [https://iwantmyname.co.nz/tumblr](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/tumblr) and they will get 20% off on any new domain registrations.

The best part is that domain-customising your tumble log literally only takes a few seconds to set up. Make sure you select "use a custom domain" option under the customize / info dropdown when you first [register](http://www.tumblr.com/register) for Tumblr. Enter your chosen domain name at this point. Then from within your [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) dashboard simply click on "domains" then "install new service" to direct your domain to Tumblr.
