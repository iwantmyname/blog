At [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) we feel strongly that more innovation is needed within the global domain registrar industry. That's why we developed our registrar platform from the ground up. Our philosophy revolves around providing a spam free, easy to use interface that doesn't get in the way of the customer. Acquiring and managing domains shouldn't be hard work!

Thousands of customers worldwide already use our services and the number is growing daily. This extraordinary level of growth has encouraged us to continually add new features and to improve the existing technology. We launched sites in the [New Zealand](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/), [U.S.](https://iwantmyname.com/), [German](http://meinname.de/) and [Dutch](http://benikvrij.nl/) markets and new partners can roll out the platform in their own language within a few hours. 

One of the big opportunities that we see on the horizon is Internationalised Domain Names (IDN). This allows domain seekers to secure their digital identity using non-Latin character sets such as Arabic, Chinese or Cyrillic for example. Unlike many registrars, iWantMyName is already fully enabled for IDN. Want to allow your business customers to search for and register 新年快乐.com? No problem.

Our sites have received [glowing reviews](https://iwantmyname.com/about) from many satisfied users all around the world. Now we are actively seeking [partnerships](https://iwantmyname.com/partner) both in New Zealand and abroad. For bloggers and other high traffic sites we can offer a great [affiliate program](https://iwantmyname.com/affiliate) that only takes minutes to set up. We pay you for any sales that are completed after click-throughs from your own website. The programme is managed by a completely independent service provider who works everything out and then sends you a cheque periodically.

For technical deployments such as integrating our API, white label reseller solution or a tailor made site that reflects a particular language or cultural setting, please [contact us](https://iwantmyname.com/support) directly.
