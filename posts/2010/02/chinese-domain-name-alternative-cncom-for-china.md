Registering a domain name under the official China country code top-level domain (ccTLD) .CN will not get easier anytime soon. Latest news is that the [.CN registry has employed 600 workers](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9155358/China_s_.cn_cleanup_shows_politics_behind_Web_rules) to manually check all domain registrations for policy violations such as pornographic content and inaccurate records.

Consequently, we have decided not to offer .CN domains as long as any restrictions are in place. However, if China is your destination market, we would like to suggest two alternative solutions: .CN.COM and .ASIA web addresses.

### .CN.COM: An unrestricted domain extension for China###

The alternative .CN.COM internet extension is managed by [CentralNic](http://centralnic.com), the registry for [.LA (Laos)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-domain-name-registration-for-lao-peoples-democratic-republic) and many other popular second-level domain suffixes such as [.EU.COM (European Union)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu.com-domain-name-registration-for-european-union) or [.US.COM (United States)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us.com-american-domain-name-registration-for-united-states-of-america). Domains under .CN.COM are completely unrestricted, enabled for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), including Chinese character sets, and can be registered by anybody worldwide. This makes it the perfect web address if you do not want a domain name that is heavily regulated.

We have now enabled .CN.COM at iWantMyName with a special introductory offer. All new registrations are only $19.90 USD until the end of April. Please see our [domain promotions](https://iwantmyname.com/domain-promo) for further details.

In our next article about .CN domain alternatives we will talk about .ASIA, the new generic top-level domain (gTLD) for the Asian community.
