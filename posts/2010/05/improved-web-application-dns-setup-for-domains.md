We've recently released major upgrades to our dashboard which dramatically improve the setup and management of your domain names. Hopefully this will make things even easier for you!

**Web application setup**

There is a new overview page that lists all available apps and services. We've also added more documentation and information within the dashboard for custom domain mapping of your favourite service.

Our web app directory now contains more than 30 services in the following categories: [email](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting), [blogs](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting), [website builder](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder), [forums](https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting), [ecommerce](https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting), [portfolios](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting), [social networks](https://iwantmyname.com/services/social-network), [url shortener](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener) and [wikis](https://iwantmyname.com/services/wiki-hosting).

**New DNS manager**

This tool has been completely re-written. Let us know if you have any troubles using it. We've got big plans for DNS management which are especially interesting for developers so stay tuned!
