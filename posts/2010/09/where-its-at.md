![austria]({{ site.images_url }}/2010-09-07-austria.png)

This month we launched a [promotion for the .AT domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria). For only $19 you can score a nifty domain that can offer many permutations for word play and domain hacks, especially in English. The .AT domain of Austria also has some quirky facts behind it.

A gre.at example of how to use this domain can be found .at [LetsEat](http://www.letseat.at/). The site offers a website builder service specifically targeted .at restaurant owners. Once they sign up for the free service, users end up with a web address that looks like this: http://letseat.at/restaurantname. Incidentally there are many excellent free online services such as this available to help small businesses. In fact with iWantMyName [Domains for Apps](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) we make it easy to domain customise a whole bunch of useful services.

Austria is a landlocked mountainous nation in central Europe with a population of 8.3 million. Bordering south-east Germany, but with its own distinct culture, Austria has one of the highest per capita incomes globally and an enviable standard of living. Obviously the world agrees th.at .AT is a useful domain too. There are well 
over 900,000 .AT domains registered globally. That's about three times 
the size of the .NZ registry. The number of registered .AT domains is expected to reach 1 million around the end of this year. Germans own about 20% of all .AT domains, but the little Austrian town of Holzhausen (pop. 800) holds the record for the largest number of .AT domains per capita with over 1200 .AT domains registered.

Now's a good time to join in the fun with this month's [huge price reduction](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria) on this popular and nimble domain.
