[iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/) is a next generation domain registrar and DNS management service. We also appreciate how much hard work is involved in starting a new venture online. That's why we are pleased to be [supporting](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/startup-weekend-science.html) the next generation of web entrepreneurs at [Startup Weekend Mega](http://mega.startupweekend.org/). We are offering a one year free domain registration to help get new projects up and running throughout the weekend. Also, check out these [great resources](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html) for web and software entrepreneurs plus a bunch of useful [hosted services for developers](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/14-new-hosting-services-applications-for-your-domains.html).

**Here's what you need to know to claim your free domain:**

1. The offer is open to Startup Weekend Mega teams that move through from the Friday evening selection round.
2. The domain holder must be a paid and registered participant at Startup Weekend Mega.
3. Offer applies to .com, .net, .org, .me domains, one per team.
4. If you want a different kind of domain (we offer almost 100 [domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions)) contact us and we'll make a deal.
5. You need to [open a free account at iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/signin) and complete the checkout process.
6. Then send us the offer code and your email address so we can refund your purchase within 48 hours.
7. SW Mega organisers will give you the code on Saturday.

Need to contact us for support or advice? We hang out on the [iWantMyName Twitter](https://twitter.com/#%21/iWantMyName) channel a lot or you can use our [support email](https://iwantmyname.com/support). We also plan to be live online during Saturday and Sunday afternoons from 2pm Pacific Daylight Time.
