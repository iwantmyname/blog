This month has seen an increase in the variety of country code top level domains (ccTLD) on offer at [iWantMyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/). With four new domains joining us, it means we have by far the [largest selection of domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) of any New Zealand registrar, with almost 100 on offer.

France played its first ever rugby test match against a [New Zealand](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) side in 1906 and was soundly thrashed. History repeated itself in 2011 during their recent pool match encounter with the All Blacks at the Rugby World Cup. So we figured the least we could do was to add .FR to our list of domains. Rugby has a huge following amongst the French and many fans have made the pilgrimage Downunder to support "Le Bleus", as the French national team are affectionately known. So if you are planning to export sporting goods or other services to Europe in the future, now is a great time secure a [French domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france) for your business.

Italy has done well against Cup minnows Russia and [USA](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/us-american-domain-name-registration-for-usa), but struggled against the Aussies. Perhaps that's because, although she shares a border with France, Italy has a slightly different sporting culture. Football is the overriding passion, slightly ahead of making fun of their risque politicians. But we added the [Italian domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy) to our United Nations of domains because .IT offers lots of crazy word play for domain hacks and is a great domain to own if you operate an information technology (I.T.) company.

Latvia doesn't feature in the World Cup. In fact they probably never even heard of the game of rugby. But we "luv" the [.LV domain ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/lv-latvian-domain-name-registration-for-latvia)and think their maroon and white national flag is rather cute too. The emerging Baltic state, whose inhabitants have strong ethnic links to both Russia and Germany, has been part of the European Union since 2004. Finally, somewhat closer to home, we [added a little oomph!](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html) by including .PH the [domain name of the Philippines](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/ph-filipino-domain-name-registration-for-philippines).
