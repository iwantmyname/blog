New Zealand is expected to take a big economic growth hit after a second devastating [earthquake](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/christchurch-quake-shock.html) in Christchurch. The seriousness of this catastrophe cannot be overstated. That's why we urge everyone to get behind [Startup Weekend](http://auckland.startupweekend.org/) a networking and web venture catalyst event being held in Auckland on the weekend of **1st-3rd April**.

Now more than ever before in New Zealand's history we all have to pull together to help keep the ship afloat. Entrepreneurs have the power to lead us out of recession and to generate new wealth that will help rebuild Christchurch. But we need to actively cultivate communities of interest and leverage the wonderful talent we have here in New Zealand. At [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) we already mentor young web entrepreneurs and are deeply involved in community building within the ICT industry. That's why we are so pleased to be able to support the inaugural New Zealand Startup Weekend.

We are looking for smart and entrepreneurial developers, designers, web strategists, marketers and investors from all over the country to rock up, collaborate and build stuff. Bring an existing team or just turn up and volunteer your business or tech skills to a brand new project on the day. See you there!

PS: If you can help out with cash sponsorship or services that would be brilliant.
