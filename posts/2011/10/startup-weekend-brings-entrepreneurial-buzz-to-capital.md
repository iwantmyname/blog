It's almost time for [Wellington Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) and we are once again getting excited about being involved in the initiative. Startup Weekend is a global phenomenon that assists entrepreneurial designers, developers and business heads to devise, build and launch a product in the short space of 54 hours.

iWantMyName is shouting drinks for all participants on Friday evening when the event will be opened by Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown. Several of the [iWantMyName team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) will also be on hand throughout the weekend to help with [business and technical advice](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html) whenever called upon. Of course we will also be providing each of the teams with a [free domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/iwantmyname-backs-startup-weekend.html) for the new project in the same manner that we did for Auckland Startup Weekend and Startup Weekend Mega in Silicon Valley.

Being a [community-minded](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html) company we love to get behind events and initiatives that are of special interest to developers and designers in particular, especially where we can roll our sleeves up and get involved too! Of course we've also aggregated a huge selection of [domain customisable developer apps](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) that are really handy for getting shiny new web projects up and running.
