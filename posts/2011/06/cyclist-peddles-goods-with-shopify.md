Claire Pascoe loved bicycles and cycling so much that when she left New Zealand to go on her travels she soon spotted a unique opportunity for an importing business. Impressed by the multitude of artistic pannier bags available for riders overseas, she decided to bring some home and open her own online shop.

But setting up an e-commerce site is really hard isn't it? Turns out that it's not hard at all. [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) is a hosted service that lets you easily set up your own "e-tail" store on the Internet. We think Shopify is great, so we included it within our [services suite](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services). That means once you've opened your Shopify store, you can easily [add a Shopify set-up](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software) to your new domain with a single click. We've even included a video to talk you through the entire process.

Claire thinks Shopify is great too and now uses it to run [Beautiful Bike Bags](http://www.beautifulbikebags.co.nz/) where you can check out her wonderful selection of creative cycle bags. Now (unlike our friend pictured above) there's simply no excuse for cyclists to feel overburdened on the way home after a spot of shopping.
