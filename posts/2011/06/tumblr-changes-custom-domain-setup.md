Blog hosting service Tumblr recently [released a new dashboard version](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/6390139071/upgrading-messages), unfortunately making it harder to find the settings for adding your custom domain to their system. The feature moved from the easy to remember URL `tumblr.com/customize` to the setting page for a specific Tumblr site.

Here's a quick tutorial on how you can domain customize your Tumblr web address in their new dashboard:
