May is New Zealand Music Month. What began as an initiative to promote more airtime for Kiwi artists has evolved into a full blown celebration of talent from our local music industry. In the current economic climate it's more important than ever to support local artists. The [NZ Music Month website](http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz/) has all the gen including a comprehensive gig guide, news and multi-media content. 

Locally developed music portal [MusicHype](http://musichype.com/) loves Kiwi music too and is helping fans to connect with both New Zealand and global artists. They even scored a very cool domain musichy.pe by cleverly using .PE the [Peruvian domain extension](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/pe-peruvian-domain-name-registration-for-peru). Bands and musicians can also easily set up their own promotional sites using their chosen domain name with [great services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/music/) such as BandCamp. 

A memorable domain makes heaps of difference when it comes to expressing yourself creatively on the web. Being able to manage your domain easily with a friendly local registrar makes a big difference too. So iWantMyName is rocking your world by [dropping the transfer fee](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) on all .NZ domains from this month. We've also seriously whacked the fees on transfers for other kinds of global domains. That's got to be music to anyone's ears.
