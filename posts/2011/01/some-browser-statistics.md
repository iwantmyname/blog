Who would have thought this two years ago. [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) was accounting for 41% of our visitors in December with [Firefox](http://firefox.com) ranking 2nd (27%) and [Safari](http://apple.com/safari) 3rd (21.50%). From the 5% using Internet Explorer, 70% are browsing with IE8+.
We quite like this.
