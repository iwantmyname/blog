Remember [C.H.iPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHiPs), the popular 1970s cop show? Lead characters Jon and Ponch had Motorola radios prominently displayed on their police motorbikes. Now Motorola makes a different kind of chip and has just sold it's mobile division to cash rich Google in a US $12.5 billion mega deal that pulls no punches about where the online behemoth is heading.

The controversial deal has raised eyebrows amongst some analysts who fear that Google will alienate other hardware manufacturers just as sales growth of its Android based platforms has taken off. On the other hand, the deal allows Google to have far greater control over its mobile product supply chain; meaning it can compete with Apple more effectively.

Industry critics have been focusing on the mobile story and the opportunity for Google to gobble up swags of proprietary patents with the acquisition; but there is another story that has been somewhat overlooked. Motorola Mobility also manufactures set-top boxes and IPTV equipment, a whole new area that Google has yet turn its full attention towards. 

In an unrelated move, Google also recently [acquired the G.co domain](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/gco-official-url-shortcut-for-google.html) for use as a url shortener. This will allow it to offer more secure short links to its branded sites as social content sharing continues to grow. The domain purchase is a big win for the [.CO domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) registry that is rapidly gaining traction as a successful and trusted service provider with many big name customers.
