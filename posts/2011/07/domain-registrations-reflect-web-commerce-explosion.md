The number of registered domains grew by over 4.5 million in the first three months of 2011, suggesting that the industry remains in good heart. Despite other businesses emerging only tentatively from global economic recession, domain registrars clocked up almost 8% in growth over the previous 12 months.

Domain registration growth rates parallel a burgeoning Internet scene as web services continue to eat into traditional business models. Rapid growth in mobile and social content also draw in ever greater numbers of consumers. Internet infrastructure provider Verisign manages provisioning for .com and .net domains, which make up around half of all registrations and [reports quarterly](http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/why-verisign/research-trends/domain-name-industry-brief/index.xhtml) on Internet growth. On average Verisign currently handles an astounding 57 billion domain name system queries each day. At peak levels of demand this can reach 67 billion transactions.

The value of Global web commerce is expected to reach almost US$1 Trillion within a couple of years and will be a key driver in overall growth of the Internet. Annual mobile commerce currently sits at a mere 2% of consumer sales transactions, but is expected to grow to US$15 billion in value within 5 years in the United States alone. So there remains plenty of scope for growth in new web and mobile commerce Internet offerings - and in the demand for domain names.
