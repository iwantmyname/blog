July brings chilly winter winds along with snow for ski fans (hopefully). So to counter the effects of winter we are offering some heartwarming [domain transfer deals](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) throughout July including some freebies.

Lately more and more people have begun wondering why the big registrars are not offering a better user experience and greater innovation. At iWantMyName, we just got on with building a great product that our customers love including offering [60+ transferrable extensions](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) and providing easy domain customisation on everyone's [favourite hosted services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services).

We've heavily discounted domain transfer charges for some of the most popular top-level domains:


*   $12.50 **[**.COM**](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-registrar-transfer-commercial)** / **[**.NET**](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net-domain-registrar-transfer-network)** / [**.ORG**](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org-domain-registrar-transfer-organisation)
*   $15 **[**.INFO**](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/info-domain-registrar-transfer-information)** / [**.NAME**](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/name-domain-registrar-transfer-names)
*   $29 [**.ME**](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/me-domain-registrar-transfer-montenegro)
Domains such as [.IO](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-registrar-transfer-british-indian-ocean-territory), [.CO.UK](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.uk-domain-registrar-transfer-united-kingdom) or [.CO.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-domain-registrar-transfer-new-zealand) can still be transferred completely **free of charge** of course!
