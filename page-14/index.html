	<p>From ICANN, in an article titled <a href="https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2014-07-15-en">&ldquo;Fraudulent ICANN Domain Name Certificates&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been brought to ICANN&rsquo;s attention that some online entities have attempted to sell fraudulent &ldquo;certificates&rdquo;, which they claim are required to protect generic top-level domain names. The perpetuators of this scam threaten registrants on the protection service with the objective of securing a fee from the registrant. The &ldquo;certificates&rdquo; look official and include an unauthorized use of the ICANN logo.</p>

<p><img src="../media/2014-07-18-icann-fraud-1.png" alt="Fraud"></p>

<p>Please note that ICANN does not issue certificates to registrants and does not collect fees from registrants directly.</p>

	<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">new generic-top level domains</a> (gTLDs) have been a moderate success up to this point. If you take a look at ntldstat.com&rsquo;s <a href="http://ntldstats.com/">new gTLD registrations chart</a>, you won&rsquo;t find dramatic gains, but the line is consistently trending upwards with more gTLDs coming out each week. And that&rsquo;s not likely to change.</p>

<p>At some point though, the success of the new gTLDs won&rsquo;t be determined by numbers (numbers can be skewed), but by visibility. Specifically, by the amount of big sites that use gTLDs as their primary internet outposts. So while we wait for BMW.com to become BMW.auto, we can hold ourselves over with Domain Incite Pro&rsquo;s <a href="http://domainincite.com/pro/popular-new-gtld-domains/">newly released feature</a> that tracks sites using new gTLDs by <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa Rank</a>.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t any sites using gTLDs in the Alexa top 500 yet, but there are 34 in the top 100,000 (which is a big deal considering the new domain extensions are still fairly new). I won&rsquo;t list them out individually (some could be malicious), but breaking them out by gTLD shows some pretty interesting trends.</p>

	<p>Running a restaurant is a hard business, and as more and more customers choose to dine at places with good design aesthetics, it&rsquo;s become increasingly important to have a similarly beautiful website. But going with an agency or freelancer to build your site can be quite expensive, so it may be wise to make your site yourself.</p>

<p>Fortunately we&rsquo;re not living in the early 2000&rsquo;s, a time when cheesy Flash site creators using animated banners were all the rage. The web platforms of today can help even the most novice restauranteurs create slick, responsive sites with integrated social platforms and menu systems.</p>

<p>So to make things easy, here are four modern platforms from our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services">one-click marketplace</a> to choose from, as well as a batch of great naming suggestions to make your site as easy to find as possible.</p>

	<p>iwantmyname has made quite a few changes over the last few months.

But there&rsquo;s still one gap in our collective skillset that we need to fill—UI design.</p>

	<p>Blogging has gotten a bad rap over the last few years because the medium is inundated with so much noise. But starting and maintaining a good (i.e. useful) blog takes an amazing amount of dedication to a very specific window of interest, which is why it&rsquo;s so rare to see blogs that are more than a year old.</p>

<p>The trick to staying engaged with a specific topic is to always have something to say, and for that, we have a great post from John O&rsquo;Nolan of <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain">Ghost</a>, titled &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ghost.org/great-blog-post-ideas/">How To Come up with Great Ideas for Blog Posts, Every Single Time</a>.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Anyone who has ever put down for a high quality website knows the costs associated. You&rsquo;re paying for planning, hosting, design, strategy, and all sorts of other minute details that go into creating a polished domain. But getting an idea of what those costs will look like can be hard—here&rsquo;s a good place to start.</p>

	<p>Big life events tend to be accompanied by countless images of every important moment, but in today&rsquo;s digital world, what happens after that? You&rsquo;re probably not going to print them all for a book, and uploading them all to large photo-storage sites seems rather impersonal. For photos like these, you need something you can customize to fit your style without any sort of platform branding slapped on top, with optional password protection for privacy if you need it. And of course it shoud also work with your very own custom domain name.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a ton of great options available. Some edgy and modern, and some more flexible and subdued. And best of all, they&rsquo;re not going to cost you a fortune to maintain. For $10 USD or less, you can create something quite amazing.</p>

	<p>Looking at the <a href="http://ntldstats.com/tld">new generic top-level (gTLDs) domain stats</a>, it&rsquo;s clear that a number of the new domain extensions are merely flashes in the pan. Some, like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.club</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.guru</a> are doing well, but niche gTLDs like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-archi">.archi</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-qpon">.qpon</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blackfriday">.blackfriday</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-christmas">.christmas</a> may need some time and luck to gain traction.</p>

<p>But one category makes a lot of sense for local residents and businesses, and also has a basis for success the other gTLDs don&rsquo;t have—cities. Around the world (aside from the US), county-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are hugely popular, with .co.uk domain extension registrations in particular numbering well into the millions. And that sort of localized naming scheme seems to translate well to cities, with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin">.Berlin</a> currently sitting as the second most popular gTLD currently available.</p>
