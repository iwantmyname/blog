	<p><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url">Squarespace</a> is an amazing, all-in-one site builder that makes top-end web design accessible to everyone. Seriously, with no skill going in, you&rsquo;ll be able to build sites, stores, photo galleries, and blogs in minutes. It&rsquo;s that intuitive.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s not quite as intuitive though is the domain setup. We pride ourselves in providing one-click installs to a ton of platforms, but sometimes there&rsquo;s an extra step involved that can turn that one click into a bunch of clicks. Have no fear though, with this short guide, you&rsquo;ll have your domain working with your Squarespace site in no time.</p>

	<p>Being involved in the local community is vastly important to us, so this year we made a conscious decision to support more events that at least some of the iwantmyname team could actively participate in. Since we are already one-third of the way through 2015, I think it&rsquo;s about time to take stock of what has been achieved so far and look at where we plan to go in the future.</p>

	<p>No matter what service you offer or product you sell, a good chunk of any business is customer support. But unlike many other aspects of running a business, how companies handle customer support can vary widely, even among companies in the same industry.</p>

<p>In our little corner of the Internet, the domain industry, we have a couple of unique challenges. First, domain registration is a comparatively low margin business, so to keep our business afloat, we rely on the support of a lot of customers. Tens of thousands, with 150,000+ domains under management. And no matter how stable your platform, when you&rsquo;re dealing with that many moving parts, any flaw, bug, or confusing process will be uncovered very quickly.</p>

	<p><img src="../media/2015-04-29-domain-dot-hack.png" alt="domain dot hack"></p>

<p>In the early days of domain registration (the dark times before the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a> were launched), there was a point where it was quite hard to find a domain that was both short and memorable. Many of the good <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial">.COM</a> domain names were taken, as were the more common words and phrases in various country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom">.CO.UK</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada">.CA</a>. So what do people commonly do when there&rsquo;s a shortage of something that&rsquo;s in demand? They get creative.</p>

<p>The idea of a domain hack is to take a word or brand, like iwantmyname, and use the domain extension as part of the word. So instead of iwantmyname.com, a domain hacker would go with iwantmyna.me (using the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro">.ME</a> TLD) or iwantmy.name (using the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names">.NAME</a> TLD).</p>

<p>We published a fairly <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-getting-the-right-domain-name-for-your-brand.html">extensive guide</a> a while back to help you figure out what to do if there&rsquo;s a domain you want that&rsquo;s already been registered, or similar issues. But we didn&rsquo;t go into a lot of detail about exactly <em>how</em> to contact the current owner of a domain that you&rsquo;re interested in acquiring though. Or what to do if you do manage to get in touch and make an offer. If you&rsquo;re in this boat, we have some tips on how to navigate these waters.</p>

	<p>Many companies say they love open source, but what does that actually mean? Does it mean they use a lot of software other people have written? Does it mean they like that they don&rsquo;t have to pay for things? Or do they understand that <em>loving open source</em> also means contributing back to the community the code came from?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start again. We at iwantmyname love open source! And when I say we love open source, I mean that we&rsquo;re always trying to work and live up to its ethos—to continuously share the things we learn, and to approach challenges with facts instead of emotion. Open-source development is all about learning and developing in the open, with people we may never meet in real life—it doesn&rsquo;t matter to any of us what we look like, who we are, what our gender is, our race, religious beliefs, or sexual preference. It&rsquo;s all irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how we can work together to make projects awesome.</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p><img src="../media/2015-03-23-vanuatu-cyclone.jpg" alt="Vanuatu"></p>

<p>For those of us who live in temperate climates, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine
the unfolding horror of a category 5 tropical cyclone bearing down on your
home with winds exceeding 200 mph. But that was the scenario facing the
inhabitants of the far flung islands of Vanuatu recently. The tiny Pacific
Ocean island archipelago took a direct hit from Cyclone Pam, resulting in
many villages being entirely flattened.</p>

<p>Incredibly and thankfully, the death toll as a result of the storm has been kept to a minimum, but a large section of the population has been left without food, water, and housing. Now a major relief operation is underway involving NGOs and neighbouring governments from the South Pacific region such as New Zealand and Australia. Technology is also playing a part in the recovery with power and communications providers rallying to get services running again quickly. We have seen <a href="http://pacificpolicy.org/2015/03/surviving-cyclone-pam/">encouraging reports</a> suggesting that some progress is being made, against all odds.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time a huge cyclone has ravaged communities in the
Pacific. Typhoon Haiyan wreaked havoc across the islands of the Philippines
in 2013. You may recall our efforts to contribute during the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html">Haiyan relief
operation</a>. With your help, we will be financially supporting UNICEF&rsquo;s operation on the ground in <a href="https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> today with an immediate donation of $6,500. We are thrilled to learn that our cash will pack twice the punch because New Zealand philanthropists Gareth and Jo Morgan have agreed to <a href="https://www.unicef.org.nz/UNICEF-New-Zealand-issues-fundraising-challenge-to-reach-82000-children-in-Vanuatu">match</a> the first $1 million in donations.</p>

<p>iwantmyname has a longstanding policy of setting aside 10 cents from every
domain registration for charitable purposes, but with the crisis being so
great, we&rsquo;ve dug a bit deeper to help out our neighbours in their time of need. If you want to make your own donation to the Vanuatu relief fund, you can do so <a href="https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu">here</a>.</p>

	<p><a href="http://melodykramer.github.io/how-betty-who-is-89-gets-her-news/">From Melody Kramer:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After we drank tea, I watched Betty read articles on her iPad. Her Internet was really slow. She kept accidentally clicking on the ads, or on parts of the story that she didn’t mean to click on. And she was getting a bit frustrated and worried — that by clicking on something, she was going to install malware or not be able to return to her story.</p>

<p>There are 13 million people between the ages of 75 and 84 in the US. There are 5 million between the ages of 85 and 94. (census) That population will grow. At some point, it will be composed of digital natives but that’s a while away. In the interim, are there better ways to design websites for this population? Are there better ways to design the news for them? Of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like any good web entity, we&rsquo;re always planning for the next evolution of our website. Whether we like it or not, trends change, platforms that were built for one thing get weighed down by incremental additions, and new technologies emerge (like responsive design) that change how sites move through the world. Those things are always moving targets that need to be addressed, but one factor that cannot be overlooked, no matter when your design/redesign occurs, is usability. At the end of the day, the single most important thing you can offer is an easy path from idea to completion.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a good example of where the internet is going. After I wrote our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/what-should-the-internet-do-with-money.html">post about .money</a>, I started looking through various finance websites. What I found didn&rsquo;t really surprise me, but it&rsquo;s worth noting nonetheless.</p>
