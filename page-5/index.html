<p>It&#39;s a new year, so let&#39;s talk a bit about domain discounts. This month, we have a host of sales carrying over from December, plus two location-based TLDs moonlighting as cultural favorites. .Vegas, hailing from the US city of Las Vegas, is synonymous on the web (and elsewhere) with gambling culture, and will likely draw interest with gaming sites and travel microsites. And .Asia, the world&#39;s largest continent, is attempting to bring online nations together for business and trade. </p>

<p>Take a look at 2015&#39;s first domain discount list, and start the new year right with a shiny new online space.</p>

<p>2014 is done, folks. Our new gTLD catalogue is now filled with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">257 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a>, including the ever-popular <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.club</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link">.link</a>, and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.guru</a> (and of course, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi">.kiwi</a>), and we have a ton more to come in 2015. </p>

<p>Now the big question...has the new gTLD launch been a success? Well, it depends what your metric is. .Xyz recently hit the 750,000 domains registered mark, making it the most registered new gTLD out there, and as Peter Roesler of Inc. <a href="http://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/will-new-top-level-domains-matter-in-2015.html">put it</a>, &quot;If you want to use one of the new TLDs to build a site with an easy-to-remember name, you won&#39;t be disappointed&quot;. Sure, the registration numbers aren&#39;t to the level of .com yet, but I think any gTLD registry owner would tell you it&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. </p>

<p>In 2015, I&#39;d expect to see steady gTLD growth as more people become aware of their existence (if the general public knew about the glorious <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza">.pizza</a> extension, we&#39;d see an online pizza renaissance for sure). And with another year of new launches, paired with the ever-dwindling supply of good remaining .coms, the growth might be faster than people expect. </p>

<p>Prognostication aside, we have a big year of gTLDs ahead of us, and it all begins with the 11 new extensions we&#39;re launching this month. </p>

		<p>I’ve never resold or purchased a domain on an aftermarket in my life, but hearing stories about that side of the domain industry is vastly entertaining. There’s intrigue, secret internet dealings, big characters, big egos—it’s all there. And this week, one of my favorite new podcasts, Reply All, covered Longform.org’s attempt to purchase their corresponding .com from Michael Berkens, reseller extraordinaire and founder of The Domains. It’s a good one—give it a listen.</p>

<p>(Just a heads up...if you’re easily offended, there are a couple curse words in this episode. Nothing big, but they’re there.)</p>

<p>There are very few certainties in life—death, taxes, the fact that eggs always taste better with a dash of hot sauce, and that on January 1st, the little numbers in the year will change ever so slightly. </p>

<p>Pre-internet, this wasn’t such a big deal. Sure, you might write the wrong year on a check or document, but it wasn’t an error the world would have to see on a daily basis. Not like on a website, where nearly all the footers in existence—the big footers, small footers, dark footers, and light footers—share one tiny trait. © 2014.</p>

<p>I say “nearly” because every year there are those who forget to manually change the year from one to the next. It’s a bit of a minor tragedy, but entirely understandable. Fortunately, Mikko Järvenpää has your back, with a clever site called <a href="http://updateyourfooter.com">updateyourfooter.com</a>. </p>

		<p>The holidays are upon us, and we’d like to thank you all for making 2014 so great. In the last year, we upped our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/about">team</a> size to ten, passed the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/celebrating-100000-domains-at-iwantmyname.html">100,000 domains registered</a> mark (and beyond), added more than <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">250 new generic top-level domains</a> (gTLDs) to the list, and managed to keep our <a href="http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname">support satisfaction at 97%</a>. It’s really been incredible—so thank you, thank you, thank you. We can’t say it enough.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting January 2015, we’re launching our monthly newsletter. In it, we’ll include all our domain sales, new gTLD launches, important news, and interesting tidbits to make your month a little better. Here’s the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/monthly">signup page</a>—we really think you’ll enjoy it. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE">Developers, developers, developers!</a> 2015 will be a big year for our API, and we’d love to hear <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/12/api-survey.html">your thoughts</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Speaking of support</h3>

<p>Just a note. With Christmas here and New Year’s coming up, support may be a little slower (but no less thorough) than our usual standard. Our <a href="http://help.iwantmyname.com">Support Center</a> is stocked with answers to a bunch of questions though, so be sure to check there first if you’re running into any issues.</p>

<p>So... sweet as. And happy holidays!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because Apple makes it, Mail is for everybody. But it’s not for everybody. Apple designed it to serve the masses, and if you want more–or less–from your email client, Apple Mail may not suit you. Maybe its old-school approach to mail, lifted from classic mail clients like Eudora and NeXTMail, just doesn’t fit the modern emailer. Maybe you want deep links to productivity apps on your Mac that Mail just won’t provide. Or maybe you’re just tired of being in a dysfunctional relationship with Mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We think Mailbox is the best alternative to Apple Mail out there, but it only works with Gmail or iCloud. If you’re not using either of those providers, the best Mail alternative compatible with most POP/IMAP/Exchange servers is the $10 Airmail 2. Airmail feels like an attempt to create a true replacement for Apple Mail, rather than rethinking the way we process email like Mailbox. However, Airmail also has the concept of filing a message to a “To Do” folder for later processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Email is one of those things people really struggle with, but there are so many tools and apps out there you may find to be more tuned to your liking. If you’re looking for a New Year’s resolution you can actually stick to, commit to making your life a little saner with an email app that fits your workflow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using a new top level domain name instead of a .com or other gTLD does not give you a benefit in Google search results. Ditto for using a .com instead of a new TLD. They’re basically the same.</p>

<p>That’s what Google says. And it makes sense when you think about it. A lot of people that think new TLDs have an SEO advantage are thinking with their heart, not with their head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it doesn’t make sense for Google to favor a new TLD over an existing TLD at this point, it could make sense in the future. It would make sense if it improved search results. Let’s go through some of the arguments that ranking new TLDs ahead of other TLDs would benefit search results, and consider if they are valid now and if they will be in the future.</p>

		<a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/12/multicurrency.html">New feature alert—we now support USD, NZD, AUD, GBP and EUR!</a>
	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-14-multicurrency.png" alt="Multicurrency"></p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been on the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/">iwantmyname website</a> lately, you might&#39;ve noticed a change in parts of the site—a new multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices (and accepting payments) in only USD (US Dollar), you can switch currencies to NZD (New Zealand Dollar), GBP (British Pound), AUD (Australian Dollar), and EUR (Euro). It&#39;s a small feature, but one we&#39;re really happy to roll out.</p>

<h3>A Little Backstory</h3>

<p>For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard. </p>

<p>But now we&#39;re a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we&#39;ve officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we&#39;re really happy with how it&#39;s working (being based in New Zealand, it&#39;s nice to be able to pay in NZD).</p>

<hr>

<p>So next time you&#39;re looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currency: in the footer (see screenshot below), on all our price lists (like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions">this one</a>), and in your account payment settings. We&#39;ve also set it up to be location aware, so new customers should automatically be assigned to their correct currency. Once switched, all prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.</p>

<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-14-nzd.png" alt="NZD"></p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions about multicurrency, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/support">feel free to ask</a>. We&#39;re always here to help.</p>

		<p><a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2014/12/15/best-fake-name-used-in-a-domain-name-scam-ever/">From Andrew Allemann - Domain Name Wire:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s how it works: A scammer, typically pretending to be an Asian domain name registrar, sends an email to the owner of a domain name and says that someone else is trying to register domain names using the same brand. The scammer says they’re reaching out as a courtesy. If the recipient doesn’t respond, the scammer says it will go forward with registering the domain names. The con is to try to get you to register the domains as a preventative measure.</p>

<p>Most of these scam emails identify the name of the purported company trying to register the “brand” in various ccTLDs. My wife got one of these emails over the weekend, and the name of the purported company is, well, quite hilarious.</p>

<p>I grew up in a booming suburb of sorts, and one of my most vivid memories (you can&#39;t choose what sticks!) was of a strange clump of business-centric hotels that popped up just off the freeway near my house. Even to a grade-schooler, the likelihood of all these rooms filling up on a given weekend was extremely low, yet the construction marched on. Knowing the basics of supply and demand, I was baffled, so I asked my dad to explain the logic. He said, &quot;Well... it looks like all the market researchers saw the same opportunity at the same time.&quot;</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned since then is that competition is good, but unless the demand is huge, some of the players will inevitably lose out. So here I am, looking at a handful of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) related to photography, wondering A. why the world needs five extensions for the same purpose, and B. which one(s) will rise to the top.</p>

<p>The &quot;why&quot; question will have to be for a later post, but predicting popularity is a thought exercise I can get behind. So let&#39;s lay out the contenders:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo">.photo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography">.photography</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos">.photos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics">.pics</a></li>
