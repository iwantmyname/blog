<p>For many people, e-commerce was the first big draw of the internet. You could go online, pick out things like clothing or electronics, then have the items shipped directly to your house. It was the future.</p>

<p>But the first e-commerce sites really weren&rsquo;t very sophisticated. They were slow, complicated, and pretty walled off from the rest of the internet. Compare that to <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/bigcommerce">Bigcommerce</a> and&hellip;well, there really isn&rsquo;t any comparison. With Bigcommerce, you get custom websites, secure carts, digital product catalogs, marketing tools, reporting, mobile-optimized shopping, etc., etc. And their online stores can literally be created by business owners who have no coding or design capabilities whatsoever. It&rsquo;s truly amazing.</p>

	<p>Actually getting your own website with your own domain name online can be a bit like exploring a foreign land. Navigating uncharted territory, trying to decipher unfamiliar language. Creating a web presence is not for the weak.</p>

<p>At iwantmyname, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into trying to make that process as painless as possible. And now, with designer <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/say-hi-to-the-newest-iwantmynamer-kevin-layshock.html">Kevin</a> on board, we&rsquo;re hoping to make even greater strides in user experience friendliness.</p>

<p>One thing some people still sometimes struggle with, though, is just how to get a website up and running. If only it all happened by magic as soon as your domain was registered!</p>

<p>Generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches have gotten off to a bit of a slow start in 2015, but the overall stats are looking more impressive by the day. According to <a href="https://ntldstats.com">ntldstats.com</a>, there are now 4,121,213 new gTLDs registered (a nearly 400,000 jump from Jan 1), and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">so many options to choose from</a>—there&rsquo;s literally never been a better time than today to get a unique domain with your brand name.</p>

<p>This month, we have eight new domain extensions, including .yoga, .work, and .energy. It&rsquo;s hard to predict individual TLD popularity because of the abundant options available, but some industry specific options (like .delivery for home delivery startups) have done pretty well in niche markets.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentleman, podcasts are a thing now, and real people are listening to them. What was once a tiny community of hobbyists and public radio hosts is now an industry with hit shows being covered by national publications. But what makes podcasting magic is that there&rsquo;s virtually nothing stopping you from starting your own show and building an audience—all you need is a half-decent mic, a quiet room, and some simple editing software.</p>

<p>It seems like every website builder has some sort of drag-and-drop feature these days, but the functionality is never quite what you think it will be. There are often limitations, and the dragging and dropping is often limited to template locations and conventional ideas. With <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/webflow">Webflow</a> though, you really can tinker to your heart’s desire—it’s almost like a modern rethinking of Dreamweaver, but fully hosted and not tied to a Creative Cloud.</p>

	<p>Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&rsquo;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.</p>

		<p>Security is one of those things people tend to shy away from because it&rsquo;s inconvenient, but keeping things safe is often as easy as using the right service. If you do a lot of online chatting, be sure to check out this secure messaging scorecard from the EFF—it&rsquo;s an interesting read.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard">From the Electronic Frontier Foundation:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the face of widespread Internet surveillance, we need a secure and practical means of talking to each other from our phones and computers. Many companies offer “secure messaging” products—but are these systems actually secure? We decided to find out, in the first phase of a new EFF Campaign for Secure &amp; Usable Crypto.</p>

<p>This scorecard represents only the first phase of the campaign. In later phases, we are planning to offer closer examinations of the usability and security of the tools that score the highest here. As such, the results in the scorecard below should not be read as endorsements of individual tools or guarantees of their security; they are merely indications that the projects are on the right track.</p>

		<p>Naming and choosing domains often go hand-in-hand, but many don&rsquo;t take either as seriously as they probably should. To get a glimpse of the professional naming process, take a gander at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/the-weird-science-of-naming-new-products.html?_r=0">&ldquo;The Weird Science of Naming New Products&rdquo;</a> by Neal Gabler of the New York Times Magazine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea is to do everything — to leave no word unturned. He visits the website onelook.com, which shows how words work with other words, or sketchengine.co.uk, which combs texts and concordances, flags parts of speech and shows how a specific word appears in billions of words of text. He visits rhymezone.com to find all the words that rhyme with a word. That is how he came up with the name for an ideation application for the Palm Pilot — he began with “brain,” looked for rhyming words and concluded with BrainForest. For this project, he thought of words about travel, but also about entertainment, the sense of engagement, connection, energy, even spheres. And he laid them all out on an Excel spreadsheet — 1,200 names in all by the time he had finished.</p>

<p>For a single project, namers can come up with as many as 6,500 names. Big naming companies will do anywhere from 40 to 50 projects a year, and smaller ones 15 to 20, which adds up to a lot of names. Of course, only one name will be chosen for each project, and that is the only one the client will own. The rest, however, won’t necessarily go to waste. Every naming agency keeps a list of its discards in a computer program. These are then classified by message (at Catchword); by distinctiveness, appeal, memorability and concept (at Interbrand); or by whatever other way the namers might want to retrieve them. Catchword has 650 of these categorized lists. And many of the names will be recycled, which suggests that there is a kind of Platonic ideal of good names, independent of products good or bad — a name so good that it could work, if not on anything, than at least on many things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now clearly many (if not most) people/brands can&rsquo;t afford the premium costs of naming firms, but we should all strive to dig a bit deeper into our brands and ideals before coming up with names (if you don&rsquo;t have at least 100 ideas on paper, you&rsquo;re probably not trying hard enough). Just another something to add to your 2015 resolutions list.</p>

	<p>It’s never more apparent how puzzling domain names are to people than when I get asked about my job. “A domain registrar? What the heck is that?” I get it all the time, but what surprises me most is that many of these same people already own domains in some form or another—usually brokered through legacy web-design firms charging $20-30/mo for Flash websites with glitzy visitor counters (seriously, if you&rsquo;re paying $30/mo for a site built a decade ago, you&rsquo;re getting ripped off).</p>

<p>So my goal of goals is to set them on the right path, usually with an abridged version of this very post—my spiel on domain names, what you’re buying, what the deal is with all the new domain extensions, what email has to do with it all, and a bit about Whois privacy.</p>

	<p>Let me start this article by confessing that we’re not SEO gurus at iwantmyname. Everything we&rsquo;ve done in the last few years in terms of SEO was done with a basic understanding of the topic and by providing a good product with relevant content and landing pages. This always served us well and we were happy with our rankings overall. With that out of the way, I’d like to tell you about our experience with switching our blog to a subdomain. </p>
