<p>Our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services">App Marketplace</a> is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &ldquo;New in the Marketplace&rdquo; blog series.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the more interesting challenges podcasters face is exposure, and most of the podcast hosting platforms on the market don’t provide much in terms of built-in audiences. <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/podbean">PodBean</a> does, and their built-in podcast marketplace has more than 500,000 independent podcasts covering any category you could ever want. And on top of that, PodBean gives you the tools you need to create customizable websites that can instantly ship shows off to all the biggest podcatchers, with options like unlimited bandwidth and storage, a simple platform for creating premium content, and advertising options via third-party networks for additional monetization.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still summer in NZ, but with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil">Punxsutawney Phil</a> seeing his shadow in on Feb. 2, the US and Canada will have winter chills for at least six more weeks—and chilly bones deserve especially good domain discounts. So this month, .CLUB, one of our most popular new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), is on sale, and we&rsquo;re hoping to see a bunch of new clubs (Summer.club? Winter.club?) pop up all around the world. And if clubs aren&rsquo;t your thing, we have 12 other extensions set at great prices.</p>

<p>For many people, e-commerce was the first big draw of the internet. You could go online, pick out things like clothing or electronics, then have the items shipped directly to your house. It was the future.</p>

<p>But the first e-commerce sites really weren&rsquo;t very sophisticated. They were slow, complicated, and pretty walled off from the rest of the internet. Compare that to <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/bigcommerce">Bigcommerce</a> and&hellip;well, there really isn&rsquo;t any comparison. With Bigcommerce, you get custom websites, secure carts, digital product catalogs, marketing tools, reporting, mobile-optimized shopping, etc., etc. And their online stores can literally be created by business owners who have no coding or design capabilities whatsoever. It&rsquo;s truly amazing.</p>

	<p>Actually getting your own website with your own domain name online can be a bit like exploring a foreign land. Navigating uncharted territory, trying to decipher unfamiliar language. Creating a web presence is not for the weak.</p>

<p>At iwantmyname, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into trying to make that process as painless as possible. And now, with designer <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/say-hi-to-the-newest-iwantmynamer-kevin-layshock.html">Kevin</a> on board, we&rsquo;re hoping to make even greater strides in user experience friendliness.</p>

<p>One thing some people still sometimes struggle with, though, is just how to get a website up and running. If only it all happened by magic as soon as your domain was registered!</p>

<p>Generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches have gotten off to a bit of a slow start in 2015, but the overall stats are looking more impressive by the day. According to <a href="https://ntldstats.com">ntldstats.com</a>, there are now 4,121,213 new gTLDs registered (a nearly 400,000 jump from Jan 1), and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">so many options to choose from</a>—there&rsquo;s literally never been a better time than today to get a unique domain with your brand name.</p>

<p>This month, we have eight new domain extensions, including .yoga, .work, and .energy. It&rsquo;s hard to predict individual TLD popularity because of the abundant options available, but some industry specific options (like .delivery for home delivery startups) have done pretty well in niche markets.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentleman, podcasts are a thing now, and real people are listening to them. What was once a tiny community of hobbyists and public radio hosts is now an industry with hit shows being covered by national publications. But what makes podcasting magic is that there&rsquo;s virtually nothing stopping you from starting your own show and building an audience—all you need is a half-decent mic, a quiet room, and some simple editing software.</p>

<p>It seems like every website builder has some sort of drag-and-drop feature these days, but the functionality is never quite what you think it will be. There are often limitations, and the dragging and dropping is often limited to template locations and conventional ideas. With <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/webflow">Webflow</a> though, you really can tinker to your heart’s desire—it’s almost like a modern rethinking of Dreamweaver, but fully hosted and not tied to a Creative Cloud.</p>

<p>Starting a blog is quite the endeavor. It’s a commitment to consistent writing, creative thinking, and unending doubt as to whether or not you’re hitting your goals. But one think blog creators often overlook is the means for audiences to have conversations around your work. Too often, the commenting/forum tools used look like they were created in the late 90s, and often function in ways that discourage natural thought processes—and that’s something <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/muut">Muut</a> is trying to change.</p>

	<p>Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&rsquo;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.</p>

	<p>In the early days of the internet, .COM was the top choice for companies and their online presences. Then, in the second half of the 2000s, we saw country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory">.IO</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro">.ME</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia">.CO</a> become popular alternatives for tech startups and developers. Now, after the 2014 introduction of the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a>, we’re looking at yet another shift. So which TLDs will take the reigns in the tech/startup world? Let’s take a look at some of the contenders.</p>
