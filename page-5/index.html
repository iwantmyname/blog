<p>These days, data is king. Big Data, data mining, data-driven decisions. It gives the impression that when you&#39;re building your online presence, whether a community, business, or audience (or all of the above), you need to learn as much about those you interact with as possible. Especially before you engage in any important decision-making. </p>

<p>Knowing everything (ideally with the first impression/interaction) should give us the insights we need to develop the perfect product, grow the most engaged audience, and pretty much be our crystal ball, right? Well, not exactly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Silicon Valley has been up in arms of late over burn rates. With private companies raising larger rounds at higher valuations than ever before and chasing broader market opportunities than possible in the past, it’s no surprise that entrepreneurs are spending at an unprecedented rate to grow as fast as they can. But, despite these understandable circumstances, several of the industry’s most respected investors have raised a red flag on the issue, arguing that it’s a symptom of good times company building that could leave a ton of companies dangerously exposed when market conditions inevitably shift.</p>

<p>For those arguing that spending with reckless abandon is the only way to build the kind of massive, high value businesses that the venture model demands, there are counterpoints available across the Valley. One such business is Zoho, the 18-year-old enterprise software company that has bootstrapped itself to hundreds of millions in revenue, and profitability.</p>

<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-15-startup.jpg" alt="StartUp"></p>

<p>If you&#39;re a podcast listener, Alex Blumberg&#39;s new show, StartUp, just might be the best new show around. Here&#39;s the synopsis, from the StartUp about page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m Alex Blumberg. My experience is in public radio, as a producer for This American Life and as a co-founder of the business-economics series Planet Money. After years of reporting on other people&#39;s businesses, I decided to start my own.</p>

<p>This show follows what happens next – my difficult journey from man to businessman. It&#39;s a classic start-up story, but one that&#39;s recorded in real time. I&#39;ve documented disastrous pitches to investors, difficult conversations with my wife, and tense negotiations with my co-founder. The result is an honest, transparent account of something that happens all the time, but that we can rarely listen in on: starting a business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d definitely recommend starting at the beginning, but the latest episode, titled &quot;How To Name Your Company&quot; is a fantastic look at how hard branding really is. Give it a listen. </p>

<p>From the Moz Blog, in an article titled &quot;<a href="http://moz.com/blog/my-recipe-for-success-how-to-launch-a-successful-blog">My Recipe for Success: How to Launch a Successful Blog</a>&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, five months on, where are we? Well, I&#39;m particularly happy with the results so far, and this is why I wanted to outline the approach that I&#39;ve taken from a content, social, and SEO perspective to get results.</p>

<p>On the topic of results, here&#39;s where we&#39;re at right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page 1 rankings in Google for the terms pescetarian, pescetarian blog, pescetarian recipes and pescetarian meals. Go ahead, Google it if you don&#39;t believe me ;)</li>
<li>4,700+ followers on our Facebook page</li>
<li>The average engagement on one of our Facebook posts will often result in around 100 likes, 5-15 comments, 20-50 shares and 100-300 clicks through to the website</li>
<li>850+ Twitter followers</li>
<li>500+ Pinterest followers</li>
<li>550 double opt-in email subscribers</li>
<li>30,000+ unique visits to the blog</li>
<li>15,000+ unique visits coming from social media traffic alone</li>
<li>65,000+ backlinks</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it&#39;s early in our campaign, I&#39;m going to share how we&#39;ve achieved what we have so far and give you as much actionable information as to how you can go out and replicate the early success that we&#39;ve had. This will include the exact strategies that I&#39;ve implemented, the tools that I&#39;ve used and any tips for accelerating growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On personal blogs, I&#39;ve been a pretty strong proponent of what I call the John Gruber method—if you consistently write something worthwhile, people will eventually come. But if you have time, dedication, and resources, the &quot;people will eventually come&quot; part can sometimes be changed to &quot;people will come very soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Truth is, there&#39;s a real science behind generating blog traffic, and it involves some combination of great content, SEO, social media, email, and a open eye to new ways to promote what you write. You just have to know where to start—and you could do a lot worse than starting with the article above.</p>

<p>From Pando Daily, in an article titled <a href="http://pando.com/2014/10/09/whats-in-a-name-the-fading-tyranny-of-dot-com/">&quot;What’s In A Name? The fading tyranny of dot com&quot;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For someone like Michael Heyward, who co-founded anonymous social networking app Whisper in 2012, as a mobile first company, he says, there was not an ounce of trepidation at not having the Whisper.com domain name. (Whisper.com itself is a junk address, filled with spam links.)</p>

<p>Heyward says that 99 percent of Whisper’s exposure comes from its app. The company has a Whisper.sh landing page, to showcase popular posts from the app and publish legal and company information.</p>

<p>In 2014, Americans spend more time in apps than they do using the Internet on desktop. With social media sites becoming a greater engine for content discovery, new sites such as Quartz are popping up that don’t really even have an official homepage.</p>

<p>I write content for a living—always have, probably always will. So when I&#39;m looking to create websites (which I do quite often), I try to take advantage of platforms that let me do my thing without needing too much help from designers and developers. </p>
