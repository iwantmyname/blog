<p>First, a definition. In short, a domain hack is a trick to use a top-level domain (TLD) as part of the word. So, instead of using WORD.COM, you&#39;d use WO.RD.</p>

<p>Traditionally, domain hacks have been used with country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like .IO in rad.io and .ES in watch.es. And amongst the right crowd, they worked because:</p>

<p>A. If you use a short, common word/phrase like &quot;radio,&quot; it&#39;s easy to remember. 
B. Even if you didn&#39;t remember what the TLD is, you knew to put the dot before the last two letters, because aside from .COM and a few others like .INFO, all the domain extensions were two letters. So &quot;radio&quot; is rad.io and &quot;watches&quot; is watch.es.</p>

<p>Basically, if you knew your audience was savvy enough to not automatically add .COM to the end of everything, domain hacks were great. But then came the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). </p>

<p>In an <a href="http://www.thedomains.com/2014/04/20/how-many-letters-on-to-the-right-of-the-dot-is-too-many-to-be-a-hack/">article</a> titled &quot;How Many Letters On To The Right of the Dot is Too Many To Be A Hack? [sic],&quot; The Domains listed domains like hollywoodreal.estate and palmbeachreal.estate as domain hacks and asked if they were too long.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pretend your website is a child, and it&#39;s your sole responsibility to name it. Technically, you could name it anything you want, but like all things, names come with connotations. You probably don&#39;t want to name your child after the scam artist next door. And you certainly don&#39;t want to name it after a village plunderer.</p>

<p>So do your research. Here&#39;s a little video guide from Matt Cutts of Google Webmasters on how you can protect yourself from registering domain names with iffy histories.</p>

<p>When Afilias announced the start of their <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pink">.PINK</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-red">.RED</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blue">.BLUE</a> sunrise periods, this is how .PINK was positioned (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/afilias-adds-color-choice-internet-192000232.html">click over</a> for .BLUE and .RED):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.PINK addresses embrace a wide range of uses, from the lighthearted fun of baby furnishings and toys to the simmering sensuality of lingerie products to the compassion and courage of cancer caregivers and patients. Young women — and men — of all ages love the optimism of .PINK and can now have a business or personal name that expresses their “pink-itude.” Finally, you can show the world that you “Think .PINK!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m definitely a proponent of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), but from the start, I wondered how popular color TLDs will be in the long run (the first day was pretty rough). </p>

		<p>Like little online children, we love each generic top-level domain (gTLD) the same. .GURU, .RED, .PHOTOGRAPHY—all are lovely in their own special way. But if we were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one, we&#39;d choose .KIWI, New Zealand&#39;s choicest new domain extension. </p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

</div>

<p>On May 1st, .KIWI is set to launch, and we&#39;re really hoping it takes off with local businesses and bloggers. Because...well...we&#39;ll finally have a TLD that&#39;s as unique and quirky as we are.</p>

<p>So go on—<a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi">pre-orders</a> are only open for a while longer. Make sure you&#39;re ready when .KIWI takes off!</p>

		<p class="small text-muted">The following is a guest post written by Peter Orum.</p>
	

	
		




	

<p>Up to now, my main web project has been founding a <a href="http://www.paintingsilove.com">social networking site</a> for artists to comment on each other’s paintings.  However, I have recently resumed taking black and white street photography after a long break, and I’d like to establish and promote a personal site for my photos.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the iwantmyname <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/which-photography-gtld-should-you-use.html">blog</a>, there are a range of different gTLDs to use for photography, including .GALLERY, .PHOTO, .PHOTOS, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .PICS &amp; .PICTURES. When I found that the .PHOTOGRAPHY domain extension was available, I tried to grab street.photography, but it was already taken. So in trying to get something as close/relevant to that as possible, I was able to get streetbw.photography. As I really wanted something starting with just &#39;street,&#39; I also pre-ordered ‘street’ with some of the other gTLDs, just on the off-chance.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a bit of a rabid podcast listener, and like any fan of a given medium, I have lots of opinions. I like Downcast more than any other podcast app, I like story driven shows over freeform conversations, and I really love NPR&#39;s Planet Money. </p>

<p>And this week&#39;s Planet Money, titled &quot;The Wild West Of The Internet,&quot; was right up my alley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are over 100 million websites ending in .com. But new options for website names are becoming available. Not only is there .com and .gov .edu, but now .ninja has been added. Also .bike, .plumbing and .cool. In all, over 1,000 new top-level domains, as they are called, will be added.</p>

<p>Today on the show, what happens when you just create a whole bunch of real estate out of nowhere? We meet some of the new land barons with big dreams. And a guy who worries it&#39;s just going to be a big mess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of the show, or just want to get a better grasp on what&#39;s going on with these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/16/303735386/episode-532-the-wild-west-of-the-internet">give this episode a listen</a>. I think you&#39;ll enjoy it. </p>

<p>What happens when you give a creative person too many ways to solve a relatively simple problem?</p>

<p>I can tell you firsthand. Panic attacks.</p>

<p>When the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were announced a few years back, my hope was that they would all fit into tidy categories. Of course there wouldn&#39;t be any overlapping TLDs—that would be madness. Absolute madness!</p>

<p>Well, skip to today and check out my own personal nightmare. Instead of fitting a brand name to a catch-all gTLD, we have <em>six</em> good gTLDs for the photography category (and plenty more in close orbit, like .CAM and .CAMERA). We have:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery">.GALLERY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo">.PHOTO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos">.PHOTOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography">.PHOTOGRAPHY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics">.PICS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pictures">.PICTURES</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So which one should a photographer choose? And what should people be thinking about when choosing one over another?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about the future of these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), and no matter where my mind takes me, I always return to one question—what&#39;s in a name?</p>

<p>Specifically, what makes one TLD better than any other TLD?</p>

<p>As you likely know, we are now coming to understand the full implications of the OpenSSL vulnerability (aka the &quot;<a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed bug</a>&quot;) that was disclosed last week. <a href="http://xkcd.com/1354/">Here is an excellent graphical explanation of the vulnerability.</a> New angles of attack against vulnerable infrastructure come up every day. </p>

<p>(Have you patched your home router and updated your passwords after <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">checking sites for vulnerability</a>?)</p>

<p>At iwantmyname, we patched all servers the day the vulnerability was disclosed. However, we also did more. Read on for more in-depth information on how we handle our security, and recommendations for our customers on managing their accounts and passwords.</p>

<p>I generally don&#39;t like to overhype things, but the sheer volume of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out next week is a big deal. Over the course of three days (April 15-17), 14 domain extensions will be going live, and a few of them are likely to be quite popular.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the full list:</p>
