				<!-- excerpt -->

<p>What happens when you give a creative person too many ways to solve a relatively simple problem?</p>

<p>I can tell you firsthand. Panic attacks.</p>

<p>When the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were announced a few years back, my hope was that they would all fit into tidy categories. Of course there wouldn&#39;t be any overlapping TLDs—that would be madness. Absolute madness!</p>

<p>Well, skip to today and check out my own personal nightmare. Instead of fitting a brand name to a catch-all gTLD, we have <em>six</em> good gTLDs for the photography category (and plenty more in close orbit, like .CAM and .CAMERA). We have:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery">.GALLERY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo">.PHOTO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos">.PHOTOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography">.PHOTOGRAPHY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics">.PICS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pictures">.PICTURES</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So which one should a photographer choose? And what should people be thinking about when choosing one over another?</p>

<!-- /excerpt -->

<h3>Thought 1: Do TLD lengths matter?</h3>

<p>The general rule is that Google penalizes any domain longer than 63 characters, but even a long TLD like .PHOTOGRAPHY should put you well under that limit. So there&#39;s probably not any SEO difference as far as length goes.</p>

<p>One definite strike against .PHOTOGRAPHY though is that it opens people up to spelling errors, particularly on mobile devices. I&#39;ve heard enough complaints about &quot;fat fingers&quot; since the launch of the iPhone to know that less characters is probably better for touch screens. </p>

<p>But, if your brand currently uses the <em>YOURNAME Photography</em> naming convention, yourname.photography is certainly shorter than yournamephotography.com. And it&#39;s certainly more accurate than YOURNAME.photos.</p>

<p>So the short answer here is yes, TLD length probably does matter, but not enough to create a hard rule. Unless the rule is that you shouldn&#39;t choose brevity over accuracy.</p>

<h3>Thought 2: Are keywords important?</h3>

<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is tricky because the guidelines change with every search engine update, but it&#39;s commonly accepted that having a descriptive domain can help search results. </p>

<p>For example, if someone did a search for &quot;New Zealand garden pictures,&quot; newzealandgarden.pictures would likely rank well. Or if you were going after a younger audience, perhaps newzealandhipstergarden.pics would work (although I&#39;d hate typing that into my iPhone).</p>

<p>But don&#39;t get too excited about keyword stuffing—<a href="http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2014/01/15/domain-name-importance-in-ranking.aspx">according to Duane Forrester, Sr. Product Manager of Bing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ranking today is a result of so many signals fed into the system the words used in a domain send less and less information into the stack as a percentage of overall decision making signals. This is great from our view (the engine) as it results in better results showing at the top since no one signal can be manipulated. From the searchers POV, it’s better simply because those sites trying to abuse their way to the top with a keyword rich domain and irrelevant or poor content cease to rank well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he finishes his thought quite well with a simple tip, &quot;Good domain names are easy to remember, easy to spell, easy to pronounce and often short.&quot;</p>

<p>So are keywords important? Probably so, but you can&#39;t con search engines like you could a decade ago. Your best bet here is to try to work terms that rank highest into your brand name. </p>

<p>As a thought exercise, I did a quick keyword search in Google AdWords and found that &quot;photography&quot; gets 135,000 avg. monthly searches, while &quot;photo&quot; only gets 60,500. Keep things like that in mind when choosing your domain/brand name. </p>

<h3>Thought 3: Which is more memorable?</h3>

<p>We&#39;re getting pretty subjective here, but memorability is probably the most important factor when choosing a TLD. Here are the three rules I&#39;d try to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As stated above, if people know your brand as <em>YOURNAME Photography</em>, go with yourname.photography. It&#39;s a bit longer than the other gTLD options, but takes no thought for your customers to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#39;t have an established name yet, try to stick to the shortest TLD that makes sense. So, .PHOTO over .PHOTOS and .PICS over .PICTURES (although you could argue that &quot;pictures&quot; gets nearly five times more monthly searches than &quot;pics&quot;). </p></li>
<li><p>Go with what&#39;s popular, and right now, .PHOTOGRAPHY is the third most popular new gTLD out there. That could certainly change in the coming months, but if the photography world gravitates to a single TLD, I&#39;d certainly consider riding that wave.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Thought 4: Should you just use a .COM?</h3>

<p>The million dollar question. If you&#39;re still on the fence about using a new gTLD, I&#39;d recommend taking a look at <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/whats-in-a-name-the-case-for-gtlds.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p>To summarize, I would recommend using a .COM if you can find your brand name on its own—like YOURNAME.com or BRANDNAME.com. In the likely event that your desired word, name or phrase is taken in the .COM namespace though, I&#39;d recommend against adding a descriptive word to the domain, like YOURNAMEphotography.com or BRANDNAMEphotos.com. That just adds extra complexity and unnecessarily squishes keywords together. Instead, go with a gTLD. </p>

<p>Look at it this way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Best:</strong> yourbrand.com</li>
<li><strong>Almost as good:</strong> yourbrand.photography</li>
<li><strong>Meh:</strong> yourbrandphotography.com</li>
</ul>
