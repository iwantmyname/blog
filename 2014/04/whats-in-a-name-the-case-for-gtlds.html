				<!-- excerpt -->

<p>I&#39;ve spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about the future of these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), and no matter where my mind takes me, I always return to one question—what&#39;s in a name?</p>

<p>Specifically, what makes one TLD better than any other TLD?</p>

<!-- /excerpt -->

<h3>.COM, because it&#39;s what people type automatically</h3>

<p>The argument for going with a .COM domain is a simple one. If you were to guess the website of a company, the first TLD you&#39;d choose is .COM. And for the vast majority of websites out there, you&#39;d be right. </p>

<p>Just look at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa</a>&#39;s top 10 sites on the web:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Google.com
<strong>2.</strong> Facebook.com
<strong>3.</strong> Youtube.com
<strong>4.</strong> Yahoo.com
<strong>5.</strong> Baidu.com
<strong>6.</strong> Wikipedia.org
<strong>7.</strong> Qq.com
<strong>8.</strong> Twitter.com
<strong>9.</strong> Live.com
<strong>10.</strong> Linkedin.com</p>

<p>Only one non-.COM, and it comes in the form of wikipedia.org, which happens to be the one of the largest, most ambitious encyclopedias known to man. But even Wikipedia began as a .COM, only switching to .ORG to make a stance agains commercial advertising (the .COM now redirects to .ORG).</p>

<h3>The local ccTLD always works</h3>

<p>For businesses outside the US, a popular choice is to go with the local country code top-level domain (ccTLD). Looking further down the Alexa list, you&#39;ll see plenty of localized options:</p>

<p><strong>13.</strong> Google.co.in
<strong>14.</strong> Sina.com.cn
<strong>19.</strong> Yahoo.co.jp
<strong>21.</strong> Yandex.ru
<strong>24.</strong> Google.de</p>

<p>A side benefit is that by stepping outside the .COM namespace, you open your brand to a world of domains not available in the crowded .COM namespace. Just look at local Wellington, NZ favorite, Flight Coffee. Instead of buying flightcoffee.com in the aftermarket, they use flightcoffee.co.nz—and it makes total sense. </p>

<h3>Where do the gTLDs fit in?</h3>

<p>The single biggest factor when choosing a domain is visibility. And truth is, in 2014, your best bet for making sure your domain is visible is to go with .COM.</p>

<p>But really, how firmly entrenched are we in this .COM standard? In the early 90&#39;s, .COM barely existed, and was still being maintained by the National Science Foundation. And it really wasn&#39;t until the .COM boom of the late 90&#39;s that we thought of .COM as being synonymous with the internet. </p>

<p>But even crazier is the fact that today, less than half the world&#39;s population is connected. In the next 20 years, we could literally see <em>billions</em> of people get online for the first time, and they&#39;ll be using the internet much like this:</p>

<p>Need directions to Flight Coffee? Type <em>directions to Flight Coffee</em> into the omnibar, then click the link you want. </p>

<p>Why would you try to guess between flightcoffee.com, flightcoffee.co.nz and a new gTLD like flight.coffee  to find directions if a quick search could deliver better, more relevant results?</p>

<p>And much like the web itself, we&#39;re only at the infancy of search. </p>

<h3>This is where SEO comes in</h3>

<p>In the future, search results will be even more personalized, blending together your location, interests, past sites visited, types of sites you typically read, and a slew of data points not even available yet. (Maybe your blood pressure or the weather will alter your search results someday?) And if Google goes far enough to eliminate the need for manual domain entry, the primary objective for naming sites will move from manual discoverability to SEO (search engine optimization). </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good tidbit about SEO and gTLDs from Bill Hartzer - <a href="http://moz.com/ugc/an-seos-guide-to-acquiring-new-gtlds">Moz.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I were selling track shoes online, then there are several options here:</p>

<ul>
<li>www.trackshoes.com</li>
<li>www.track.shoes</li>
<li>www.yourbrand.com/trackshoes/</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, one of the most valued ranking factors is still links. And I personally believe that it will be a long time (perhaps at least several years) until links are de-valued as a search engine ranking factor (if they&#39;re ever de-valued). If you were getting links, which domain name or URL would you want to use? Personally, just by looking at that list above, I&#39;d like to build links to www.track.shoes since each keyword is technically &quot;separated&quot; and doesn&#39;t run together. As you look at track.shoes and trackshoes.com domain names, there&#39;s a better chance that you would get a &quot;keyword&quot; anchor text link directly to the home page. This is the same reason why we tend to see companies rank for their company name: most of the links pointing to their website include the company name (the keyword) and it&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize that thought, his recommendation is to use gTLDs as a method to separate keywords, as opposed to mashing them together behind a .COM TLD. And in a world where most simple .COM names are taken, gTLDs give brands a wonderful opportunity to isolate their natural name from their qualifier. </p>

<p>As the example states, the brand <em>Track</em> could now register Track.shoes and keep their brand name whole as opposed to using Trackshoes.com.</p>

<h3>The main takeaway</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a scary new world out there, with hundreds of TLDs to choose from, but you probably need to worry a lot less than you currently might be.</p>

<p>Just remember this—when choosing a domain, your best option is probably the YOURBRAND.com naming convention. But if you&#39;re finding yourself settling with something like YOURBRANDcoffee or YOURBRANDshoes.com, it might be best to look <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">elsewhere</a>.</p>
