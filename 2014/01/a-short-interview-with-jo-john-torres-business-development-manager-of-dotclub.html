<!-- excerpt -->

<p><strong>iwmn: Hi Jo-John, thanks for chatting with us! Let&#39;s start with the big topic--tell us all about .club. Who do you see as the primary market for it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jo-John:</strong> We see <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.CLUB</a> as a mainstream, mass-market TLD, and it has already consistently been listed in the &quot;Top 10&quot; or &quot;most popular&quot; of the new TLDs by websites offering pre-registration interest and watch lists. Of all the top names, .CLUB will be the first of the most popular names to launch early in 2014. All the other top names (excluding GEOs) are still in contention or have GAC advice which may delay their launch.</p>

<p>We see the market for .CLUB as very broad, including clubs and membership organizations, retailers for their loyalty and affinity programs, sports teams, fan clubs, night clubs, golf, tennis and country clubs, all of the millions of social groups on Facebook, Yahoo, Google and LinkedIn, as well as anyone with a passion for something. Because of this very broad appeal, .CLUB is typically featured in several categories, such as Business, Sports, Entertainment, Social, Travel, and Generic.  </p>

<p>Also, the word &quot;CLUB&quot; hits the mainstream market throughout the whole world.  The word CLUB is spelled the same and means the same all over the world. The meaning of the word is bringing people together who share a common bond of interest and passion, which is about building communities. It&#39;s your passion, your .CLUB!</p>

<!-- /excerpt -->

<p><strong>iwmn: We&#39;re hearing a lot of talk about the launch of the new gTLDs (like .club, .blog and .app) being the start of a post-.com era. Do you think the average &quot;web surfer&quot; is ready for that?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jo-John:</strong> We truly feel the &quot;web surfers&quot; of today&#39;s generation are ready. Because many of the new TLDs, like .CLUB, actually are words that add meaning to whatever you put to the left of the dot, they can offer better branding identity and representation making it a better way to target their audience. Not only is it very hard to get a good .com name anymore, but what does &quot;.com&quot; actually mean? </p>

<p>The new gTLDs will offer businesses and consumers a great deal of choice when it comes to finding the perfect domain name. Choice is always a good thing. .CLUB, for example, is an open, universal and global gTLD with no restrictions or special requirements for getting a name. That means that .CLUB will draw all sorts of people who belong to a large or small group or organization sharing the same bond of a common goal, interest, or passion.  </p>

<p><strong>iwmn: We love a good domain name here at iwantmyname, and .club has a number of great domain possibilities available (chess.club was a huge hit in my younger years). Give us a few good ones people should be pining for.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Jo-John:</strong> There are so many great names where the word to the right of the dot actually adds meaning and value.  Retailers can use a .CLUB name for their loyalty programs, such as Safeway.club or Admirals.club. Then, there are the social groups like the one you mentioned you were part of, Chess.club. How about people who are Poker Hobbyists like Poker.club or owners of Jeeps who have a passion to go off-road and have a club called Jeepsters.club, and of course for all of these club categories there are countless regional versions - BocaRatonChess.club, VegasPoker.club, MiamiTennis.club, and on and on and on.</p>

<p><strong>iwmn: What does the future of .club look like? How big do you expect it to get?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jo-John:</strong> We expect the future of .CLUB to be very bright as there are millions of existing clubs who could use the name as well as all the other market segments we mentioned earlier. We have a high-level goal to reach 5 Million Domain Names in 5 years, and while aggressive, we feel it is attainable. We&#39;re positioning .CLUB as a mainstream global brand, and we are backing that up with world-class partners and an extensive marketing campaign.  </p>

<p><strong>iwmn: Last but not least, given that you&#39;re the experts on .club, I&#39;m assuming you know your way around a bottle of club soda. Have any good club soda tips for us?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jo-John:</strong> You mean .CLUB Soda, our official beverage!  ... Just add some ice &amp; gin or vodka and it is the perfect drink to when you visit a night.club! ;) </p>
