<p>Let&#39;s face it, I, like many of my colleagues, have a bit of a problem. I think of the web as a blank canvas, just waiting for my ideas to populate its empty space. And every time I have a new idea, I do one thing—scramble to grab the corresponding domain name. </p>

<p>My ongoing quest has gotten a bit easier since the launch of the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a> (being able to get just about any name in some form is a huge time-saver), but the underlying problem still remains. If/when I lose interest trying to make small ideas flourish, I find myself sitting on a pile of empty dreams and untapped potential (at least until the domains expire). </p>

<p>The real hurdle is the process it takes to create and market new sites. It&#39;s much easier today than it was a decade ago, but you still have to design them (although templates are getting better and better), brand them, come up with a consistent content strategy, create a bunch of social accounts and mailing lists, then promote the hell out of them. It&#39;s exhausting! </p>

<p>The proposed solution? From Brian Knapp, in an article titled, <a href="http://retromocha.com/learn/put-everything-on-one-domain/">Everything On One Domain</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is so much more value in having everything on this website than there is in having even two or three different domains we are managing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further on...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best part is when we want to launch something new or explore an idea, we just create a page and put it out there, email our list, and see what people think. Also, we don&#39;t have to hunt for a new domain name for every idea we have. We just create a new page and boom, we&#39;re done.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that any time you can increase focus and decrease friction in your business you are better off.</p>

<p>So, stop buying new domains and start focusing your energy on one domain.</p>

<p>P.S. Focusing on one domain worked pretty well for Apple, it might work for you too.</p>

<p>Google Apps are fine—in fact, they&#39;re quite wonderful and have changed the industry in so many ways—but there are countless reasons why you might want to go with something non-Google for your email. Fortunately, there are quite a few alternatives out there, and one of our very favorites, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain">FastMail</a>, released an awesome new app today making it an even more viable Google alternative. </p>

<p>Check out all the app&#39;s details on the <a href="http://blog.fastmail.com/2014/11/12/fastmail-app-for-ios-and-android-now-available/">FastMail Weblog</a>, or just download it now (for free) on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fastmail-email-calendars-contacts/id931370077?mt=8">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastmail.app">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p>Being scattered all over the world has its advantages. For one, there are no work hours, set workspaces, or dress codes. And meetings are cut to a minimum because there&#39;s only so much time everyone is online at once. </p>

<p>But sometimes you need some face-to-face time to make in-person connections. To hash out real problems and create lasting solutions. So once a year, we like to meet up for a week or so and get it all out of our system. Last year we chose <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/the-iwantmyname-team-on-tour-fiji-edition.html">Fiji</a>, which is only a short 2.5 hour flight from New Zealand, and it went so well that we stayed with the four-letter theme and packed our bags for Bali. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">generic top-level domain (gTLD) program</a> launched with a bang, but the month of October was a bit slower than the rest. Last month, only six domain extensions went live, but one particular TLD made a big wave—.NYC, which is already the eighth most popular extension available (still well behind .Berlin for the top spot for city extensions). </p>

<p>This month, things are picking back up a bit, with 15 domains coming out—and a few of them seem to be destined for the <a href="http://ntldstats.com/tld">top 25</a> (.help seems like a good bet). Predicting domain extension popularity is certainly an inexact science though, so before I go off and put on my prognostication hat, here&#39;s the full November list.</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		




	

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/facebook-offers-life-raft-but-publishers-are-wary.html?_r=0">From The New York Times:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook hopes it has a fix for all that. The company has been on something of a listening tour with publishers, discussing better ways to collaborate. The social network has been eager to help publishers do a better job of servicing readers in the News Feed, including improving their approach to mobile in a variety of ways. One possibility it mentioned was for publishers to simply send pages to Facebook that would live inside the social network’s mobile app and be hosted by its servers; that way, they would load quickly with ads that Facebook sells. The revenue would be shared.</p>

<p>That kind of wholesale transfer of content sends a cold, dark chill down the collective spine of publishers, both traditional and digital insurgents alike. If Facebook’s mobile app hosted publishers’ pages, the relationship with customers, most of the data about what they did and the reading experience would all belong to the platform. Media companies would essentially be serfs in a kingdom that Facebook owns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter who you are, at the end of the day, if you&#39;re writing worthwhile content meant to be read by worthwhile people, <em>you</em> want to be in control of that content. And that requires your own domain name and a platform that gives you complete control over what happens.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t want is to be solely dependent on someone else&#39;s world. Facebook, Google+, Medium—these are places that exist to make other people lots and lots of money. Sure, they can be great sources of social traffic, what happens when your needs (readers) and their needs (profit) don&#39;t align anymore? How sure are you that a future algorithm change won&#39;t completely wipe your work for your reader&#39;s eyes?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re anything like us, you probably know all-to-well the excitement of trying out new hosted services, then linking them to a subdomain of your main domain. You might try out a platform like Desk and put it on help.domain.tld, then try another platform on support.domain.tld. And inevitably, you&#39;ll find the one you like best and move on from there. </p>

<p>But so many of us make the mistake of forgetting all the unused subdomains we have. On the surface, nothing on your site is any different, but then you start noticing the credit card statements filled with services you&#39;re not actually using. Canceling them is easy, but then there&#39;s the domain side. Even after you cancel the billing, your unused subdomain (let&#39;s say help.domain.tld, which was on Desk) is still being linked to the platform, and when you go to the domain, you&#39;re met with the default platform error message. </p>

<p>Nothing to worry about, right?</p>
