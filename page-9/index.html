<p>Being scattered all over the world has its advantages. For one, there are no work hours, set workspaces, or dress codes. And meetings are cut to a minimum because there&#39;s only so much time everyone is online at once. </p>

<p>But sometimes you need some face-to-face time to make in-person connections. To hash out real problems and create lasting solutions. So once a year, we like to meet up for a week or so and get it all out of our system. Last year we chose <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/the-iwantmyname-team-on-tour-fiji-edition.html">Fiji</a>, which is only a short 2.5 hour flight from New Zealand, and it went so well that we stayed with the four-letter theme and packed our bags for Bali. </p>

	<p>The November 2014 domain discounts are up, and this month we have 21 domain extensions set for sale. Included are a number of ccTLD favorites, all sorts of colors, and a good variety of useful generic top-level domains (gTLDs) for the social web.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">generic top-level domain (gTLD) program</a> launched with a bang, but the month of October was a bit slower than the rest. Last month, only six domain extensions went live, but one particular TLD made a big wave—.NYC, which is already the eighth most popular extension available (still well behind .Berlin for the top spot for city extensions). </p>

<p>This month, things are picking back up a bit, with 15 domains coming out—and a few of them seem to be destined for the <a href="http://ntldstats.com/tld">top 25</a> (.help seems like a good bet). Predicting domain extension popularity is certainly an inexact science though, so before I go off and put on my prognostication hat, here&#39;s the full November list.</p>

(If you&#39;re not using it, give DuckDuckGo a shot. Unlike Google/Bing, DDG doesn&#39;t collect or share any personal information, and ads really are kept to a minimum.)</p>

<p>And now, DuckDuckGo is letting the community &quot;hack the search engine.&quot; </p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		




	

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/facebook-offers-life-raft-but-publishers-are-wary.html?_r=0">From The New York Times:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook hopes it has a fix for all that. The company has been on something of a listening tour with publishers, discussing better ways to collaborate. The social network has been eager to help publishers do a better job of servicing readers in the News Feed, including improving their approach to mobile in a variety of ways. One possibility it mentioned was for publishers to simply send pages to Facebook that would live inside the social network’s mobile app and be hosted by its servers; that way, they would load quickly with ads that Facebook sells. The revenue would be shared.</p>

<p>That kind of wholesale transfer of content sends a cold, dark chill down the collective spine of publishers, both traditional and digital insurgents alike. If Facebook’s mobile app hosted publishers’ pages, the relationship with customers, most of the data about what they did and the reading experience would all belong to the platform. Media companies would essentially be serfs in a kingdom that Facebook owns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter who you are, at the end of the day, if you&#39;re writing worthwhile content meant to be read by worthwhile people, <em>you</em> want to be in control of that content. And that requires your own domain name and a platform that gives you complete control over what happens.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t want is to be solely dependent on someone else&#39;s world. Facebook, Google+, Medium—these are places that exist to make other people lots and lots of money. Sure, they can be great sources of social traffic, what happens when your needs (readers) and their needs (profit) don&#39;t align anymore? How sure are you that a future algorithm change won&#39;t completely wipe your work for your reader&#39;s eyes?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re anything like us, you probably know all-to-well the excitement of trying out new hosted services, then linking them to a subdomain of your main domain. You might try out a platform like Desk and put it on help.domain.tld, then try another platform on support.domain.tld. And inevitably, you&#39;ll find the one you like best and move on from there. </p>

<p>But so many of us make the mistake of forgetting all the unused subdomains we have. On the surface, nothing on your site is any different, but then you start noticing the credit card statements filled with services you&#39;re not actually using. Canceling them is easy, but then there&#39;s the domain side. Even after you cancel the billing, your unused subdomain (let&#39;s say help.domain.tld, which was on Desk) is still being linked to the platform, and when you go to the domain, you&#39;re met with the default platform error message. </p>

<p>Nothing to worry about, right?</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/nielsen-will-soon-rate-everything-web-videos-articles/">From Wired:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nielsen ratings have long held huge sway over the business of television, but television isn’t like it used to be. So, on Tuesday, Nielsen announced that it’s expanding its ratings system to all kinds of digital content to give both its creators and advertisers a more meaningful way to measure popularity in the online era.</p>

<p>The most striking development in Adobe’s new system is that it’s designed for comparing disparate kinds of content. The new ratings, Nielsen says, can rank an online video next to a podcast next to an article. Unlike television or radio, the internet isn’t a medium that funnels just one format. The aim of Nielsen’s new ratings is to create a context to figure out what people care about online, regardless of what form it takes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just a reminder that internet advertising is still in its infancy. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what the internet looks like in 20 years, once the big media entities switch their primary funding from TV to the web. The last two lines of the article say it all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The old way made a lot of people in old media a lot of money. If someone can approximate the old way for new media, maybe more of that money will start rolling in, just like it used to.</p>

<p>In my opinion, personal branding is the hardest of all the branding types. Seriously. (How many failed aliases have you tried to use in the last decade? I&#39;m at three.). But now that the new generic top-level domains have launched, getting your real name on the left side of the dot is easier than ever. So what domain extension do you want on the other side?</p>

<p>Picking the right one can be tricky, and there are a number of things you should consider before making your choice. Let&#39;s break down some of your options.</p>
