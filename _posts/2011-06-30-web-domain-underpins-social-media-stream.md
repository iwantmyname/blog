**Social Media Day** kicks off around the world today with a bunch of [events](http://up.org.nz/events/social_media_day_mashup) aimed at promoting discussion about social media. So now with the prospect of many [new domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/blog/2011/06/new-era-unfolds-for-domains.html) on the horizon, it is timely to think about the importance of a good domain name in relation to social media. Whether you are promoting a business or a personal brand, your domain name ultimately forms the foundation for all your online marketing initiatives because the website you own should be the confluence of your social media stream.

Rand Fishkin, founder and CEO of the [SEOMoz web community](http://www.seomoz.org/blog) and analytics summed it up nicely when asked recently about his preference between a self-managed website and using social media solely to promote a brand. Whilst he stresses that social media has huge reach, he also cautions us that none of the major social media platforms will ever be customisable in the same way as if you actually control your own site.

**"With a website, you can custom build virtually any form of analytics, leverage any type of web technology to display/deliver content and control your own destiny."

**Whether you are building an online business or simply growing your own personal brand, if your website remains the focus then by extension your web domain is the fundamental basis for your online brand initiatives. In fact there are many domain customisable [web services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) that can help you project your brand image online. These range from [personal profile sites](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) that aggregate your social media stream through to [blogs](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/) and simple [site builders](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/). 

**iWantMyName** offers almost **100** different domain extensions to [choose](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) from and easy one click set-up for dozens of cool web services.
