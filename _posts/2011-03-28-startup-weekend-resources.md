This year [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) has been involved in supporting Startup Weekend events around the globe. We are also giving away some domains so that each team has a digital coat hanger to [anchor](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/blog/2010/11/anchor-your-social-media-presence-with-a-domain.html) their web venture upon.

Here's a bunch of article links that we thought might be useful for the entrepreneur teams and others too:
