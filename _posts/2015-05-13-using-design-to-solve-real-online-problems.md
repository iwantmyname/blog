Designers. Friends. Frienemies. For too long you've been using domain names like fullnamedesign.com (or the slightly more mysterious *lastname*design.com) to show off your online portfolios. So many letters! So much waste! Before you spend one more day fiddling around with this madness, let's get down to clearly identifying the problem you probably don't even know you're facing, and how we can fix it. Together.

<!-- /excerpt -->

For this example, let's pretend that all the letters in a domain name before the "." are pieces of furniture... and they're all beautiful. Here's the question. In a well-designed space, how many beautiful pieces of furniture do you want? Five? Six? Eight? Yes, yes, yes.

14?! 

Woah, woah. That's a lot of furniture before the dotâ€”but that's how many letters there are in "fullnamedesign." And if your name happened to be Nathaniel Tabernacle (which would come to nathanieltabernacledesign.com), you're looking at a whopping 25!

So how do we fix this? Just nix the word "design" before the dot and go with the brand new [.DESIGN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-design) top-level domain (TLD), the designiest TLD on the market today (although [.NL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands) might give you some Dutch designery street cred). Instead of fullnamedesign.com, you could just have fullname.design! Beautiful spacing. Clean, legible words. It's everything you could ever want from your domain name. 

And from May 18-31, we're dropping the price of .DESIGN from $69 USD to $39 USD. That's less than some people spend over the summer on a week of morning cold brews (coffee, not beer... although morning beer is delicious).

Let's make this happen, designers. Your domain names are all cluttered with excess and it's giving people anxiety attacks.
