As New Zealanders patiently await the [.NZ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) launch on September 30, we'd like to give the rest of the world a chance to get excited about our newly shortened domain extension. So I present to you... my top 5 domain hack possibilities using .NZ.

<!-- /excerpt -->

But quickly, before I get too excited about pouring through the Scrabble Word Finder for [words ending in "ns"](http://www.scrabblefinder.com/ends-with/ns/), here's a quick refresher on what a domain hack is. [I'll quote myself](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html):

>**Domain hack** - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or phrases out of domain names.

Things like:

> **.es:** mak.es, bak.es, flak.es, cak.es, tak.es, cod.es, dat.es, pag.es, pi.es, stor.es, smor.es (yum), veggi.es, whistl.es, [YOURNAME]lik.es
>
> **.io:** rad.io, pat.io, tr.io, rat.io, aud.io, cheer.io, portfol.io, scenar.io, card.io

So without further ado, here are my top 5 domain hack possibilities using .NZ. 

1. **sig.nz**- Think of all the glorious signs you should show off that deserve to live on a site ending with a "Z". This is a Tumblog waiting to happen.
2. Current NZ Prime Minister John Key's name doesn't fit the bill, but former Prime Minister William Hall-Jones (1906) certainly would've impressed the local youth with a **williamhall-jo.nz** domain.
3. **Krake.nz** - Because one Kraken simply isn't enough.
4. **Allia.nz** - As of 2013, [Allianz was](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Allianz) "the world's largest insurance company, the 11th-largest financial services group and 25th-largest company according to a composite measure by Forbes magazine." They'd be crazy not to domain hack their brand name.
5. **Pytho.nz** - Not to leave the devs out, I'm proposing this as the grand site for Python implementations. These are free ideas, people.

Have a better idea? Make sure to pre-order it by September 30th before geniuses like myself turn it into internet gold.
