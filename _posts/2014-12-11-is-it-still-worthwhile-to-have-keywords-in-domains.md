[From the Can I Rank blog:](http://www.canirank.com/blog/keyword-domains/?session=22f69924c5835d1f302e33d3a4529b55)

>Keyword domain names were once thought of as a golden ticket to top rankings, but the general consensus in the SEO community seems to be that their power has diminished in the wake of Google’s Exact Match Domain update.
>
>What, if any, role do keyword domains play in SEO today? Is it still worth spending tens of thousands of dollars for a category-defining domain name if it’s not an automatic ticket the front of the line?

> Specifically, we want to examine:
>
+ Are keyword domain names still beneficial?
+ How much do they help?
+ In what ways do they help?
+ What is that help worth, in dollar terms?

If you've ever gone through the process of naming a website, you've probably struggled with this very issue—is it better for business to have your domain name stick to a brand (dominos.com) or a keyword (dominos**pizza**.com)? I'd be the first to tell you not to worry about it—the quality of your product will eventually trump optimization in rankings—but my cavalier mentality might be getting in the way of a very real SEO benefit. Especially if your website is solely focused on a single topic or product.
