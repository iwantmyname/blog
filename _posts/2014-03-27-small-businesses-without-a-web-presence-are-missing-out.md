Canadians spend more time online than any other country—45.6 hours per month—[according to CIRA](http://www.cira.ca/factbook/2013/canada-online.html). So it's not surprising that [three-quarters of Canadians research purchases online](http://globalnews.ca/news/1215210/small-businesses-need-to-expand-web-presence/).

What is surprising, then, is that [as this article states](http://globalnews.ca/news/1215210/small-businesses-need-to-expand-web-presence/), only 45.5 percent of Canadian small businesses are online. (41 percent have a website, specifically.) It's safe to say even fewer have a mobile-friendly web presence, despite the explosion in smartphone popularity and mobile usage. And despite having nearly [ten times the population](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2119.html), [the stats in the United States are similar](http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/429783/group/homepage/).

This is a huge missed opportunity for businesses to showcase and educate potential customers about their products or services, and enable people to contact them. And that's just the basics of how creating an online presence can benefit companies. 

Companies should also consider investing resources in content like a blog or engaging with customers, prospects, and others via social media. These can be a boon for a company's marketing and customer relations efforts. Companies can really show off their expertise and become trusted information sources. 

Even if a prospect isn't ready to buy _yet_, if a company has provided valuable information, that person is more likely to return when he/she is ready to buy.

With social media, companies can engage directly and immediately with prospects and customers. They can answer questions, provide information, or address complaints right away. It's a key customer satisfaction differentiator these days to be easy to contact in the ways your customers prefer.

Canadian businesses doing business online help keep dollars north of the border as well. Per the article, at present two of every three dollars spent by Canadians go to the US. (And don't get us started on cross-border shipping...)

The .CA domain is an immediate indicator for those who prefer to shop locally with whom they're doing business. Kind of like sewing a Canadian flag on your backpack, but for the Internet. [It's the fourth fastest-growing domain extension.](http://www.cira.ca/factbook/2013/the-global-net.html) And [Canadians prefer doing business with .CA](http://www.cira.ca/factbook/2013/ca-in-canada.html).

So if being online is so advantageous to Canadian businesses, why are less than half of them embracing these opportunities? Well, some people remain afraid of technology. They might think they need to have highly technical expertise to design and run a website, though this is no longer the case.

[There are many services available](https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/) to help business owners get an attractive, informative site up and running quickly and easily—no coding necessary. Social, ecommerce and other features can be included as well with a few clicks.

Another consideration for businesses is the time and effort required to maintain a good web presence. Really, though, that depends on what the goals of having a website are, and the needs of customers and prospects. A website that mostly showcases products and services and provides contact information doesn't need to change very often.

If a business wants to have [a blog](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/), though, it is important to update it regularly. The best way to keep your audience's attention is for them to expect and look forward to hearing from you. Newsletters are a great tool to accomplish this as well.

Social media presences like Twitter or Facebook also require regular activity. People have short attention spans online. If your business participates in social media, expect to respond to people quickly when they contact you via those channels. This is why it's common for businesses to have staff to manage web and social efforts as the company grows. Then the business owners can focus on what they do best – growing and running a business.

So come on, Canadian businesses! Let's give those [British companies](http://www.ibtimes.com/shopping-online-united-kingdom-denmark-sweden-have-most-online-shoppers-charts-1426988) a run for their money online.
