In addition to the recent delegation of .KIWI, another favorite of ours, [.BERLIN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin), has been officially delegated, making it the second European city after [.WIEN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wien) to make the cut (others such as [.NYC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc) and [.SYDNEY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sydney) are soon to follow). 

A special thanks should also go out to the [.BERLIN team](http://dotberlin.de) for being one of the true pioneers of the gTLD program. With Berlin being a European tech hub with ["2,500 tech startups, and hundreds of millions of euros in investment from some of the world's biggest venture capital funds"](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/03/berlin-poor-sexy-silicon-valley-microsoft-google), we expect to see a lot of .BERLIN sites on the web in a short amount of time.

Pre-orders have already begun, so head over to our [.BERLIN page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin) to stake your claim on a fresh domain.
