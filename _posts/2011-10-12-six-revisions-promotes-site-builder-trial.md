In an inspired multi-media match, popular web design and development blog site [Six Revisions](http://sixrevisions.com/) has teamed up with one of our favourite apps Squarespace to offer a one year [free account subscription](http://sixrevisions.com/contests/giveaway-3-subscriptions-to-squarespace-website-builder/#more-5999) for three lucky users.

Six Revisions engages writers, who are also developers and designers in real life, to thoughtfully craft comprehensive articles across a wide spectrum of topics on web development. [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/) provides an outstanding hosted website builder application that has sky-rocketed in popularity these last few years. In fact Squarespace was one of the first apps that we implemented, allowing easy [one-click set-up of a Squarespace site](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url) on your chosen domain name.

The evolution of Squarespace is an interesting one that somewhat mirrors our own, having also begun life bootstrapped from a suburban bedroom. Despite advice to the contrary, Squarespace moved very early to distance itself from advertising based revenue. Founder Anthony Casalena soon realised that customers would pay for excellence, so consequently focused on building an easy-to-use interface that allowed people to have fun building cool websites for themselves. By 2009 Squarespace found itself on the Inc. magazine Fast 500 list and was soon attracting the attention of some seriously influential investors.

Squarespace offers a trial account, so users can play and check out the service without obligation. But the Six Revisions offer extends to a full service subscription for a whole year. Simply add a comment to the [Six Revisions blog article](http://sixrevisions.com/contests/giveaway-3-subscriptions-to-squarespace-website-builder/#more-5999) explaining why you'd love a free Squarespace account. The competition closes on October 18th.
