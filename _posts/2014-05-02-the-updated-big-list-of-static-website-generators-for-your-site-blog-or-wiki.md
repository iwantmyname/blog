<!-- excerpt -->

Dynamic websites certainly have their place on the internet, but you may find the enhanced security, performance, and ease of hosting a static site to be just what you need. So here's a big list of static site generators to get you started, sorted by language/platform.

Note: Writing a comprehensive list of static site generators would be nearly impossible (the quantity is astounding), and not all that useful, so the following list only contains generators that are actively being maintained and/or have a decent website. If you have anything to add to the list, just let us know via Twitter [@iwantmyname](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname).
