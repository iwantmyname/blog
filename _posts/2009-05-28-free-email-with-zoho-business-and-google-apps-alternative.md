We have added another email hosting & online collaboration service to our [Domains for Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns) offering. **[Zoho Business](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite)** offers a free email solution / business portal for up to 10 users - all under your own domain name. By registering your domain with iWantMyName you can now benefit from our easy domain configuration feature for Zoho Business and start using email with just a few clicks. Here's how it works:

> 1. **[Register](https://iwantmyname.com/)** or [transfer](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) the domain name you want to use
> 2. [Sign up for a free Zoho Business account](http://business.zoho.com/)
> 3.  **Add your domain name** to Zoho Business:
> ![zoho_add_domain.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2009-05-28-zoho_add_domain.png)
> 4.  Choose the **CNAME validation** method:
> ![zoho_validate_domain.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2009-05-28-zoho_validate_domain.png)
> 5.  Enter the validation code in your iWantMyName dashboard under "Services --> Zoho Business" and **we will configure your domain** with the respective DNS settings (CNAME and MX records) automatically.

The free version of Zoho Business is a great alternative to [Google Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain) and offers 1GB storage per user. You can upgrade at any time to the paid version with **25GB storage and professional support** for $5 USD / month or $50 USD / year.
