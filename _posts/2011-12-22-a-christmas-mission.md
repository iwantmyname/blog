Well it's that time of year once again when both credit card limits and shoppers' good humour are stretched to breaking point. Are you dreading your next excursion to the overcrowded shopping mall? No fear. 

The growing trend towards [online shopping](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting/) helps avoid long checkout queues and gives you better control over budgets, from the comfort of your lounge settee. In fact this year we've even [recommended](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/a-christmas-cracker.html) some cool Kiwi online games companies to our United States customers in search of unique gifts for their kids. Have you thought about giving a domain name as a pressie? We recently had a customer [build and domain customise a Weebly website](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address) to give away as a clever Christmas gift.

But let's not forget what the true spirit of Christmas is all about. After a very busy and eventful [2011](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html) we should all take time to reflect on our blessings and spare a thought for others who are less fortunate. The [Wellington City Mission](http://www.wellingtoncitymission.org.nz/) is an iconic and much loved institution that assists many people in need, especially at this time of year. From food banks to mission for elderly programmes, the City Mission does a power of good across society working with lonely, hungry or displaced people that need a helping hand. It's very easy to get caught up in the commercial hoop-la associated with Christmastime. But for a meaningful gift, why not [donate to the City Mission](http://www.wellingtoncitymission.org.nz/public/help-us) or another caring charity in your area?

**Have a Safe and Enjoyable Festive Holiday Everyone!**
