title: This week in gTLDs is for the IT crowd. Plus some thoughts on .EMAIL
---

<!-- excerpt -->

This week's batch of gTLDs has a bit of a theme, made up of a handful of options any support/IT team can get on board with. We have:

+ [.SOLUTIONS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-solutions)
+ [.BUILDERS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-builders)
+ [.TRAINING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-training)
+ [.SUPPORT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-support)
+ [.EMAIL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email)

<!-- /excerpt -->

Of course like any good Top-Level Domain, these gTLDs have a number of good uses—like Lego enthusiasts with .BUILDERS and sneaky henchman with tactical .SUPPORT. 

One gTLD I can't quite wrap my head around though is .EMAIL. The way email addresses work is that the information after the @ is your overarching website URL. So, if my website was chris.com (it's not), my email would be something like hello@chris.com. 

The question is, would the owner of chris.com want to register chris.email to act as a specified email domain, as opposed to just using hello@chris.com? When you hear "something at something dot something," isn't it implied that it's an email address? And isn't it easier for people to remember email addresses when they are attached to websites?

Here's a glimpse of what Donuts has in mind with the .EMAIL gTLD. From an interview on [prlog.org](http://www.prlog.org/12264400-this-weeks-featured-tld-is-email.html):

> ***DotAnything:* How do you envision domains within the .Email TLD being used?**

> *Donuts, Inc.:* "We leave this decision to the end-user registrant. This is a more specific TLD, so it's clearly likely it can be used for e-mail services (Example: you may someday tell a friend that you could be contacted at mary@smith.email), but it could be used in other contexts as well -- perhaps someone is interested in rating e-mail services or displaying funny e-mails for entertainment. Surely there will be creative uses we haven't anticipated."

It'll be interesting to see how the public uses .EMAIL in the coming months. Obvious use cases don't seem clear to me at the moment, but I've certainly been surprised in the past (I definitely didn't foresee .GURU's popularity). It's always fun to see the internet expand in new and exciting ways.

If you're interested in any of the five domains coming out this week, pre-orders are still open—but not for long. The official release is on March 26th at 16:00:00 UTC.
