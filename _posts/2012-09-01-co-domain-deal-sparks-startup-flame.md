Earlier this year we [challenged you](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2012/02/co-domain---what-will-you-build.html) to think about contributing to rebuilding the economy through entrepreneurship. We also explained how the .CO registry is building a reputation as a secure and popular digital foundation for start-ups. Now from September we can pass on a fantastic reduction in the price of your .CO domain, so there's no excuse for not signing up and getting your .COOL new business online.

For the remainder of this year we can offer [.CO domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) for only $19. That's a huge reduction of 42% and a great domain deal for companies that are just starting out. There are some [fantastic new companies](http://www.go.co/case-studies/) already using .CO domains, including [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and [Duck.co](http://duck.co/) the Duck Duck Go user community. The .CO domain space is relatively under-populated at present, so it's an attractive option if you are looking at building a great brand online.

Whatever your plans are for your new .CO domain, don't forget iwantmyname helps you to find a bunch of hosted services that can be easily domain customised to [get your online venture up and running quickly](https://iwantmyname.com/services).
