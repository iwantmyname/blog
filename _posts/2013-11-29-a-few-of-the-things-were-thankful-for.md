It's Thanksgiving today in the United States, and even though we're a Kiwi company across the International Date Line (it's already the 29th here), it's as good a time as any to give thanks to all the people who've helped us have a great 2013.

### Our Amazing Customers

This year we've served thousands of customers here at iwantmyname, each with unique ideas, goals and interests. And through outposts like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname), and even our [email support channel](https://iwantmyname.com/support), we've had the opportunity to talk to a ton of them.

PhDs. Bloggers. Photographers. Developers. Each and every one we're thankful for. And we're working hard this year to make our platform even better for the people who matter most (like you!).

### The Community

We couldn't possibly name all the people who've inspired us in 2013, so we won't try to come up with any sort of large, incomplete list. And as Paul said in an [August blog post](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/08/iwantmyname-in-the-community.html), "the whole ecosystem here is fueled by good coffee and excellent local craft beer," so our memory might be a bit fuzzy anyway. But for all those in the community who've helped make us who we are today, thank you, thank you.

And if you're ever in the Wellington, New Zealand area for a conference or holiday (or if you happen to live here), be sure to stop by and [say hi to the team](https://iwantmyname.com/about).

### The iwantmyname Team

Coming from me, the newest staffer at iwantmyname, it's truly amazing to see what a [lean group of seven](https://iwantmyname.com/about) (soon to be eight... [apply today!](https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/backend-developer)) can accomplish. Every question answered, every site feature added, every bug stomped and every post we push live is completed by the most dynamic team I've ever been a part of. 

And for that, I'm more thankful than anything.

Happy Thanksgiving America.
