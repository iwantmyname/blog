[From Akshat Rathi - Pando Daily:](http://pando.com/2014/01/16/10-tiny-places-that-have-their-own-domain-names/)

>That is why, although there are the 206 sovereign states (of which 11 are not recognised by the United Nations), there are 255 country-code domain names.

>This can go too far. For example, Heard and McDonald Islands, a dependency of Australia in the Indian Ocean, has its own top-level domain name, ".hm", even though its population is zero, and its official website uses Antarctica's top-level domain name, ".aq". It is also not alone.

Ever heard of the Heard Islands? Or the beautiful New Zealand territory, Tokelau? Check out [this link](http://pando.com/2014/01/16/10-tiny-places-that-have-their-own-domain-names/) from Pando Daily to see the ten least populated regions with their own top-level domains (TLDs).
