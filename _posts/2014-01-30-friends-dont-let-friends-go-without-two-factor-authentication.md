> It&#39;s easy to forget. I didn&#39;t have 2FA enabled for my domains at [@iwantmyname](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname) until reading [@n_is_stolen](https://twitter.com/N_is_stolen)&#39;s story at [http://t.co/mWj65ZrLKE](http://t.co/mWj65ZrLKE).

One of our least favorite things is to hear about on the web is a security breach. You know, in a perfect world we wouldn't have to worry about these things, but the truth is that threats persist and nobody is perfectly safe.

There are things you can do to make yourself safer though. An obvious tip is to improve your passwords (123456 isn't good enough), but in addition, you should also set up two-factor authentication (2FA). 

As Timo wrote when we [first announced 2FA in May](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/protect-your-domain-registrar-account-with-two-factor-authentication.html), "This adds an extra layer of login protection for your account to prevent third parties from accessing domains and making unauthorized changes to settings such as nameservers or DNS records."

And this isn't just something you should do with us, 2FA is an extra security step you should use for all your web presences. A ton of web platforms are adopting it as an extra security measure, so take advantage when you can. And if a platform you're on doesn't offer 2FA, ask them about it. Security is extremely important to everyone, and the more we can collectively improve security on the web, the safer we'll all be.

If you have any questions about two-factor authentication, [definitely let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
