There's no question that [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) makes it easier and faster to register and manage domain names in New Zealand. Now we are making it easy to win some delicious New Zealand brewed boutique product from [Mata Beer](http://www.mata.net.nz/).

iWantMyName is a global registrar platform technology also created right here in New Zealand. We've been quite chuffed with the enthusiastic response we've had from our Kiwi customers, so we thought we would give something back. Because we are a Kiwi-German team and are discerning about what we drink, we selected the delicious Mata Artesian German style lager to give away.

Our [New Zealand blog](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/blog) is a great way to give feedback and to keep in touch with new services on the site. If you [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ) and then re-tweet our [blog url ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/blog)during Wednesday 2nd of June, you will go in the draw for a pack of Mata Artesian. Winners announced at 5pm.
