The official **.TEL iPhone application** is available in the AppStore now. It offers an easy interface for all .TEL owners to update their domains directly from their iPhone or iPod touch. You could update the status before boarding a plane, on a road trip (don't forget our [DomainApp to register domains](https://iwantmyname.com/iphone)) or just with your current location to tell your friends where you are.

The main features of My.tel are:

*   Add, remove, hide or show your contact information
*   Update your status
*   Publish your location with an embedded map
*   Add or remove folders and profiles
*   Manage privacy settings
*   Add or remove keywords

The app works pretty well and especially the map feature helps to share your current location with your friends. Imagine being at this cool party (we all know how difficult to find they can be sometimes) and you could tell your mates: "Just go to my .TEL domain if you want to come by".

If you [download the My.tel app](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=308822420&mt=8) you currently also have the chance to [win a $10,000 iTunes gift card or a MacBook Pro from Apple](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/04/download-domainapp-win-itunes-gift-card-macbook-pro-ipod.html). You don't have a .TEL domain yet? [Check if your name is still available](https://iwantmyname.com/).
