title: "These off-kilter domain extensions could bring some interesting websites"

---

![wtf]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-07-31-wtf.jpg)

We're big fans of all the new generic top-level domains (TLDs) [coming out](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates), but we have a fascination of sorts with the extensions that are particularly off-kilter. The ones that probably won't be used for traditional company websites and blogs, but for strange creations and alternative microsites.

Next week, we have three launching—.fail, .rocks, and .wtf. And we don't really have any expectations on their registration numbers, but we're super interested in seeing what kinds of domains get created.

If you're planning on creating a quirky website with these TLDs, we're running a little sale (pre-orders are open, so get your name on the list before they're open to the public). All we ask is that you share your creation—let us know what you've built on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname) and maybe your site will appear in a future post.

##The sale

*Note: All sales are launch/first year promos. Renewal prices will go back to the normal price in parenthesis after the first year.*

+ [.FAIL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-fail): $35 ($39)
+ [.ROCKS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rocks): $16.50 ($19)
+ [.WTF](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wtf): $35 ($39)
