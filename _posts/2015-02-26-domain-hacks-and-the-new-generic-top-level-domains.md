Domain hacks aren't for the feint of heart. They disrupt the status quo of website naming, they're often hard to say out loud, and countless online guides have been written warning people not to get too clever with their domain names.

But...I'm just going to come out and say it...I love a good domain hack. They're counterculture without being overly brazen and they stick in my head forever (despite being hard to say sometimes). And with hundreds of new domain extensions to choose from with the launch of the new [generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), the domain hack possibilities are practically endless.

<!-- /excerpt -->

Before I get into it, let's set a working definition for what a domain hack is. 

***

Domain hack - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or brand names out of domain names, like bit.ly (brand name) or iwantmyna.me.

***

Now clearly, with these new gTLDs running around, the definition of domain hack is in a bit of flux. Is a domain like chess.club a domain hack? I'd argue that it's not, unless your brand name is ChessClub. If every gTLD that makes a phrase is considered a domain hack, then the term itself has been diluted beyond comprehension. We just can't have that! So... no phrases for domain hacks, just words and brand names. 

With these boundaries in mind, let's find some good gTLD domain hack possibilities (I'm not checking each for availability... this is really just to get your mind going).

+ ra.bid
+ specifi.city
+ ac.company
+ dis.credit
+ super.fund
+ bl.ink
+ never.land
+ hyper.link
+ de.parts
+ bo.red
+ at.tax
+ net.work

So many good options! Again, domain hacks are definitely for the feint of heart, but if you find yourself hopelessly attracted to clever domain/TLD combinations, we're right in the middle of a domain hack renaissance. 

And if you need any help finding a killer domain hack, look no further than the trusty [Scrabble Word Finder](http://www.wordfind.com/#words) (under advanced options, you can specifically ask for words that end with any combination of letters). Also, if you have a specific word in mind, our friends over at [Domainr](https://domainr.com) have the perfect domain search for the task—it takes any word you put in and shoots back a handful of awesome options, including any combination of domain hacks available (I typed in bored and got back bo.red *and* bo.re/d... both taken already, but still amazing).

Happy domain hacking!
