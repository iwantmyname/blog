<!-- excerpt -->

Giving back has always been part of the culture at iwantmyname—from [hands-on teaching overseas ](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html) to [supporting our local tech startup scene](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/lightning-strikes-twice-in-wellingtons-startup-scene.html)—but on our 5th birthday we decided to do something a little more permanent. Given that there are only ten of us, our plan of action was to help fund [highly efficient aid initiatives](http://charitynavigator.org/) that could do so much more for people around the world than we ever could on our own. Our pledge was to give [10 cents from each domain registered](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html) to a charity of our choosing, and our first recipient was Save the Children, who was working hard at the time to help the Philippines recover from Typhoon Haiyan (and they're back on the ground now to help with [Typhoon Hagupit](http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6150549/)). 

This year, our plan is to support local initiatives in Bali, an island that was very hospitable to us during our yearly planning meeting. While in Bali, two aid initiatives were brought to our attention—Karuna Bali and IDEP.

###[Karuna Bali](http://www.karunabali.com/)

A few days after we settled in at [Hubud](http://www.hubud.org/hubud-villa/), Novi Danto, an employee of Karuna, spoke to us about how the organization was making great strides in teaching teenage children from smaller villages who might not otherwise have access to educational opportunities. Based in the town of Campuhan, Karuna Bali provides education for young adults in introductory computing, English and personal leadership skills. Best of all, Karuna Bali's administration is entirely funded, so "100% of sponsorship donations are applied to the program." It's a great cause, and our 2015 goal is to fully sponsor the tuition fees for three students.

###[IDEP](http://www.idepfoundation.org/)

IDEP is a well established organization that works in the area of sustainable agriculture, mostly focusing on permaculture, tree planting, and youth environmental education. But a major side focus is training for natural disaster preparedness (which are a constant threat to the region), and assisting "local communities to provide food, shelter, energy and other needs in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way." IDEP employs local people, but also have a lot of support from offshore expertise and are endorsed by UNESCO.

We think IDEP has both the scale and depth of knowledge to make a substantial difference through education, farming practice, and helping to  build robust communities across Indonesia. Our goal is to contribute $10,000 to IDEP by the end of 2015.

There are so many wonderful charities and initiatives that need funding around the world, so if you're able, we encourage you to give back anything you can. And if you'd like to join us in funding our 2015 charities, here are the donation pages for both [Karuna Bali](http://www.karunabali.com/index.php?section=5) and [IDEP](http://www.idepfoundation.org/howyoucanhelp/donatetoday) (and also [Save the Children](https://secure.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6239401/k.C01C/Global_Action_Fund/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp), our 2014 choice). 

Happy holidays!
