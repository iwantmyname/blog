title: Mou might hit 1.0 after all (correction: it will)

When I started writing in Markdown, one of the first editors to draw me in was [Mou](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/10/tools-we-use-mou-for-writing.html) (you know, after I got sick of writing solely in TextEdit). It was cleaner and faster than many of the editors out there, but what really excited me was the side-by-side Markdown editing and rendering. I loved the fact that when I created a link, I could see it instantly formed in the right pane—and if I fudged it up somehow, it was easy to find the error. 

But then Mou decided the development of the app was too taxing, tried to sell it, then kind of stopped supporting it after no offers were made. It was a sad day for Mou fans, and many of us scattered to various apps. For me, I've been playing around with MacDown as a replacement for the Mou experience and Byword for more of a pure writing tool, but still find myself using Mou from time to time—just for the nostalgia (or because I still have it as my default app for opening .md files).

So when I recently found that Chen Luo, the developer of Mou, was looking to build a team to continue the app's development, I was thrilled.

[From indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you):

>Mou has been in beta for years, it was once Chen Luo's personal sparetime project. After 3 years of development, more than 300,000 people are using Mou, and this number is keep increasing.

>But Chen has never thought of Mou could become so popular today, as the user group grows, more and more feedback comes, he soon realized the bottleneck of one man sparetime development: There're too much planned for 1.0 and there're so little a single developer could do with his sparetime.

>To finish the 1.0 goal, early this year, Chen even thought of selling Mou to a team with enough ability, but didn't find a suitable one.

>Chen Luo didn't give up, instead of selling Mou to another team, today he is trying to build his own team ([25.io Inc](http://25.io/)), wanting to work full-time on Mou.

The goal is only $20,000 USD, which is very doable, and the campaign doesn't end until November 28th, which is a ways away. And the reach goal would be super great.

>We'll be glad to open source Mou if we can reach $100,000 USD (5 times of our $20,000 USD goal). Forget the crappy clones, let's open source the original Mou!

So if you miss Mou updates as much as I do, head on over to [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you) and give a few bucks. It would make a lot of Markdown people (like me) very happy.
