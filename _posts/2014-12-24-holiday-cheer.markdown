The holidays are upon us, and we’d like to thank you all for making 2014 so great. In the last year, we upped our [team](https://iwantmyname.com/about) size to ten, passed the [100,000 domains registered](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/celebrating-100000-domains-at-iwantmyname.html) mark (and beyond), added more than [250 new generic top-level domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (gTLDs) to the list, and managed to keep our [support satisfaction at 97%](http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname). It’s really been incredible—so thank you, thank you, thank you. We can’t say it enough.

### News

+ Starting January 2015, we’re launching our monthly newsletter. In it, we’ll include all our domain sales, new gTLD launches, important news, and interesting tidbits to make your month a little better. Here’s the [signup page](https://iwantmyname.com/monthly)—we really think you’ll enjoy it. 
+ [Developers, developers, developers!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE) 2015 will be a big year for our API, and we’d love to hear [your thoughts](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform).

### Speaking of support

Just a note. With Christmas here and New Year’s coming up, support may be a little slower (but no less thorough) than our usual standard. Our [Support Center](http://help.iwantmyname.com) is stocked with answers to a bunch of questions though, so be sure to check there first if you’re running into any issues.

So... sweet as. And happy holidays!
