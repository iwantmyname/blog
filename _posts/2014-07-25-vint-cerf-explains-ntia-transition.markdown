title: "Watch Vint Cerf explain the NTIA transition (he rides a giant cat at the end)"

---

<!-- excerpt -->

We typically like to spare our customers the politics of the web, but Vint Cerf, the "father of the internet" (who now works for Google) recently narrated a great video explaining the transition of internet oversight from the influence of NTIA (a US government organization) to the more global ICANN.

It's short, educational, and has a great frame at 2:22 where a drawn depiction of Vint Cerf is sitting on top of a giant angry cat under a rainbow (I believe he just won the internet).
