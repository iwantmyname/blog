title: We like Trello, too
---

<!-- excerpt -->

Selecting the right tools is extra important for small companies. We feel the impact of having to use something that just doesn't quite work much more quickly and widely given that it affects a larger percentage of the workforce.

Conveniently, though, it's also easier for small teams and individuals to try out various tools, adopting, tweaking and discarding until we find the right fit. This is not so much the case with "enterprise solutions".

We really enjoyed this behind-the-scenes piece from [Bobby Grace](https://twitter.com/bobbygrace) at [Fog Creek](http://www.fogcreek.com/) on [How We Make Trello](http://blog.fogcreek.com/how-we-make-trello/). Trello is one of our [favorite tools](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/11/the-tools-we-use-trello-for-content-and-idea-management.html) for project management.

We even use it *almost* the same way as the Fog Creek team does... though we celebrate with craft beers rather than champagne, and our development process has more of a blues guitar riff than a sax solo.

The most important boards for myself and [Chris](https://twitter.com/hashtaghall) are the Content ones, focusing on resources for our [Support Center](http://help.iwantmyname.com) and [blog](http://blog.iwantmyname.com). We haven't managed to integrate a picture of a lumberjack punching a bear into our support documentation... yet.
