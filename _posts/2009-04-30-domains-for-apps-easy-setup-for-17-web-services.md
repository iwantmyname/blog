The main reason [why we've built iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/about) was to make domain
management much easier. From searching for available domains to the [domain registration process](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/04/video-how-to-register-domains-fast-and-easy.html) and finally helping you to use domains your
favourite way, we aim to simplify the entire experience. No matter if
you want to start your own business or just launch a personal website
or blog, iWantMyName streamlines the process of promoting your brand
with a custom domain name. So that's why we're really excited to
introduce our revamped domain configuration service "[**Domains for Apps**](https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns)" featuring some of
the most popular applications on the web.
