Hay Carramba! [Codemania](http://codemania.co.nz/) is storming into town and guess who's riding shotgun with the unofficial official [pre-event party](http://twtvite.com/iwantmyname-codemania) at **5pm on** **Thursday 29th March**? 

The Nacho Libre themed, platform agnostic software conference for developers opens the following day with a huge range of expert speakers and tech talks programmed. If you plan to arrive in town the evening before, feel free to head along to our [welcome drinks](http://twtvite.com/iwantmyname-codemania) being held in conjunction with [Auckland Tech Startups Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/auckland-tech-startups/).

We've also got one or two of the Codemania guest speakers plus the [iWantMyName team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) showing up to take the bull by the horns, so come along and chat to them in a relaxed setting.

This Meetup is open to any web or [software developers](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) generally and of course all the hard working tech start-up folks from around the City of Sails. Naturally, we'll be shouting a round of Cervezas and Margaritas to warm things up. 

**You can sign up on the [Auckland Tech Startups Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/auckland-tech-startups/) group site or on [this Twtvite page](http://twtvite.com/iwantmyname-codemania).**
