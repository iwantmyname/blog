title: The Domains finds some good .EMAIL registrations, and also some sneaky ones

I [wrote a bit](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/this-week-in-gtlds-is-rigged-up-for-the-it-crowd-plus-some-thoughts-on-email.html) yesterday about use cases (or a potential lack thereof) for .EMAIL domains, but it looks like plenty of brands have snapped them up in the Sunrise period. Or so it seems...

[From Michael Berkens - The Domains:](http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/25/some-interesting-email-domain-registrations-the-dallas-cowboys-miss-again/)

> Another big company that missed on getting their .Email domain, is the car maker Bentley, that didn’t register the domain during email and the domain Bentley.email is owned by Bentley Art Gallery in Phoenix.

>Some political domain names were registered all under privacy including BarackObama.email, HillaryClinton.email,  RandPaul.email and Rushlimbaugh.email

>Of course depending on use the registrant of those domains could easily lose them in a URS or UDRP.

We'll certainly have to do a follow-up post on UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy) in the coming days, but the gist is that trademark-based domain disputes can be taken to court if the trademark holder feels they have been wronged. [Here's how ICANN puts it:](http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp) 

>Under the policy, most types of trademark-based domain-name disputes must be resolved by agreement, court action, or arbitration before a registrar will cancel, suspend, or transfer a domain name.

So when you hear something like this, you just have to shake your head. Also from [From Michael Berkens - The Domains:](http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/25/meet-the-1st-email-cybersquatter-grabs-up-espn-pepsi-starbucks-chevrolet-nfl-more/)

>I couldn’t help miss the registrations by a organization out of Los Alamitos, CA named Viva Las Vegas who wound up getting a great domain in LasVegas.email, but went after and got domain names matching some trademarked and well known companies.

The list includes registrations like Boeing.email, CocaCola.email, Starbucks.email, and a few others. But honestly, I'm inclined to think that brands won't care at all.

Just think of the above mention of Starbucks. What would motivate a company of their stature to move their company emails from @Starbucks.com to @Starbucks.email? The only reason I could see them taking notice would be if Viva Las Vegas started sending scam emails with Starbucks branding—but that would certainly end badly. 

The scam emails could be great though:

Dear INTERNET USER,

We recently did a DNA study on Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and found that you are his closest relative. And because he takes care of his family, we are sending you $5,000,000. All we need in return is your name, home address and social security number. 

Love,
kash5000000@starbucks.email
