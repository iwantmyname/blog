<!-- excerpt -->

To the casual observer, chat rooms are likely a thing of the past. A relic of the early internet where people discussed big topics, sometimes took on bizarre identities, and quickly discovered how connected we could all be. But while term "chat room" has largely been removed from our vernacular, countless people are still chatting away online, making [.CHAT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-chat) the perfect TLD for your next great forum, podcast, or chat room (they still exist!).

### .CHAT for forums

As far as TLDs go, forums don't really have a go-to namespace. Some use .COM, as it's the most popular TLD. Some use .ORG and .NET, as forums are, by nature, networks and organizations. But with the .CHAT TLD, forums have a unique namespace that is relatively free from naming competition, informally describes what's going on, and is familiar to those of us who began their web lives in the 90's. Sure, it's not as direct as [.FORUM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-forum), but .CHAT clearly has a place. 

### .CHAT for podcasts

These days, podcasts come in all shapes and sizes. Some feature investigative stories, some feature very specific advice—but some are just people talking to each other. It's clear that a formal conversation would probably use something a little less loose than .CHAT, but any show featuring casual conversations would work perfectly. Think morning.CHAT, work.CHAT, or chrisandtimo.CHAT.

### .CHAT definitely still works for chat rooms

Backtracking a bit, just because chat rooms are less popular today than they once were doesn't mean they don't exist. Surprisingly, using Google Keyword Planner, the term "chat room" still gets 246,000 searches a month, and if you do a simple search for "chat room" you'll find a huge collection of chat rooms waiting to be discovered. So if you're looking to start a chat room anytime soon, there's clearly still a demand (or maybe there's just a large legacy supply... do your research)—and .CHAT is as perfect a TLD as you'll ever find (maybe we'll even chime in if you go on to create domain.CHAT).
