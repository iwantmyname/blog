We like entrepreneurs. You like entrepreneurs. And if you've always wanted to be one, now's your chance. 

From [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/blog/9137905-announcing-the-4th-shopify-build-a-business-competition):

> To participate in this year's (Build a Business) competition, all you have to do is come up with a product to sell, open a Shopify store and pick a category (which will determine your mentor).
>
>  At the end of the competition, the nine stores that sell the most over any two month period during the competition will each win a $50,000 cash prize and a VIP trip to New York to meet with their mentor.
>
>  The competition runs from October 1st, 2013 to May 31st, 2014 and any Shopify store that was opened after June 1st, 2013 may join the competition.
