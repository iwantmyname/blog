With the [Beervana Festival](http://brewersguild.org.nz/beervana2010) looming on the horizon we thought it timely to run another beer giveaway promotion through our [Twitter channel](http://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ). Simply re-tweet the link to the [iWantMyName blog](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/blog) and you'll be in the draw for another pack of delightful Mata Beer. At the end of Wednesday we will pull a winner out of the hat and then arrange to drop the beer off to you.

But even if you don't win the Mata Beer, you can still get along to the [West Coast IPA Challenge](http://www.forum.realbeer.co.nz/events/west-coast-ipa-challenge) this weekend down at Wellington's Malthouse in Courtenay Place. Since the Malthouse moved to their new digs the pub has emerged as the unofficial "party central" for local beer aficionados and connoisseurs. What better place to enjoy the hoppy delights of your favourite Kiwi made beers? Enjoy.
