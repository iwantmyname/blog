### Part 2: How many domains are registered worldwide?###

After the latest [VeriSign's Domain Industry Brief](http://www.verisign.com/Resources/Naming_Services_Resources/Domain_Name_Industry_Brief/ "VeriSign Domain Industry Brief") there were **184 million domain name registrations across all top-level domains** by the end of the second quarter 2009.

The following graph shows the growth over time and the distribution between different domain extensions:

From these 184 million total registrations, **gTLDs account for 109.6 million registered domains and ccTLDs have a registration base of 74.4 million addresses**.

Other quick facts about the domain name industry:

*   20.9 million new domain names registered in the first six months of 2009.
*   .COM & .NET account for 50% of all domains registered worldwide.
*   The top 10 country code domain extensions comprise 66 per cent of all ccTLD registrations.
*   The top 3 ccTLDs .DE, .CN & .UK represent 45 percent of all registered ccTLD names.
*   .AR (Argentina), .RU (Russia) and .BR (Brazil) are currently the fastest growing ccTLDs.
