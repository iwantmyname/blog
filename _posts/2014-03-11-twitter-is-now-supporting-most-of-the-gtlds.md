title: Twitter is now supporting (most of the) gTLDs.

Aside from general recognition that the new gTLDs exist, the biggest hurdle we face is [platform adoption](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/02/an-open-letter-to-web-platforms-about-gtld-adoption.html). Or, better put, getting the big social platforms to recognize gTLDs as real domain extensions. 

And I'm sure you can see the barrier we face—with the internet being as segmented and siloed as it is, these domain extensions don't stand a chance unless all the big platforms get on board. Site discovery hinges on social sharing, and without it, they practically don't exist. So it brings us great joy to say that just this past weekend, Twitter made the leap.

[From Kevin Murphy - Domain Incite:](http://domainincite.com/16000-twitter-starts-supporting-some-new-gtlds)

>As of some point in the last 48 hours, you can type something like “nic.berlin” or “fire.plumbing” in a tweet and Twitter will automatically turn it into a clickable link.

>The switcheroo seems to have happened in the last two days, as [this conversation](https://twitter.com/dotberlin/status/441314462818390016) may illustrate.

With so many new TLDs launching though, adoption is looking to be an ongoing struggle—as the article indicates.

> it seems that any TLD delegated on February 5 or earlier gets clickable links in Twitter and those delegated over the last four weeks do not.

Even still, this is certainly a good first step. But we'd like to see more. A lot more. 

So here's the deal. If you come across a platform that isn't accepting gTLDs, let them know. And let us know so we can let them know. And then let everyone you know, know, so they can let them know, too.

Now...go forth!
