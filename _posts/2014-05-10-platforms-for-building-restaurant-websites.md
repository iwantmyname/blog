<!-- excerpt -->

Running a restaurant is a hard business, and as more and more customers choose to dine at places with good design aesthetics, it's become increasingly important to have a similarly beautiful website. But going with an agency, or even a freelancer, to build your site can be quite expensive, so it may be wise to make your site yourself. 

Fortunately, we're not living in the early 2000's, a time when cheesy Flash site creators using animated banners were all the rage. The web platforms of today can help even the most novice restauranteurs create slick, responsive sites with integrated social platforms and menu systems.

And to make it even easier, here are four platforms you can easily link your domain name to from our [one-click marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services).

![Squarespace]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-05-10-squarespace-restaurant.jpg)

**[Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url) ([website](http://www.squarespace.com/tour/restaurants))** - "Say goodbye to Flash websites and PDF menus. Squarespace makes exceptional design and modern functionality available to all restaurants. Best of all, it's a piece of cake to update yourself."

Squarespace does a lot right with its simple website template system. With no design or development skill, you can create a responsive site (meaning it resizes automatically for any screen size) with beautiful photography, a great menu system, OpenTable integration, social connections and even an online sales platform. 

![Virb]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-05-10-virb-restaurant.jpg)

**[Virb](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain) ([website](http://virb.com/restaurants))** - "Virb makes it easy to serve up a great website for your hungry guests, with simple tools and features to keep up with your fast-moving world."

Like Squarespace, Virb is a comprehensive site builder that has entered the restaurant market in a big way. With no dev background, you get a number of beautiful templates with menu systems, contact pages, social integrations and OpenTable.

**[Site Hungry](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/site-hungry-for-restaurants) ([website](http://sitehungry.com/))** - "Site Hungry allows you to set up a brand new restaurant website in less than 5 minutes. Share all of your restaurant's hours, location and contact information, menu, and social media in one place."

Unlike Squarespace and Virb, the Site Hungry platform is 100% dedicated to building restaurant sites. And as far as ease of use goes, it may be the easiest to get up and running. The platform doesn't quite have the full feature-set of the bigger, more established platforms yet, but I'd expect steady growth as the user-base grows.

![alt]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-05-10-letseat-restaurant.png)

**[LetsEat](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/custom-domain-letseatat) ([website](http://www.letseat.at/))** - "Let's Eat is made for busy people who want to update their menu specials on the fly, not deal with HTML and JavaScript. It is an advanced restaurant website builder that doesn't come with a steep learning curve."

LetsEat is another restaurant-only platform that integrates menus, photography and social together to create clean, simple sites. But the differentiator for LetsEat is its "app store." With little effort, you can integrate services like OpenTable, Constant Contact, OpenDining, Taskvilla and SeatMe to create exactly the site you need. 

###Don't forget about the new gTLDs

Finding the perfect domain name can be just as important as building a great site. But if you can't get a good .COM, there are a bunch of [new top-level domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (TLD) coming out for restaurant sites, including:

+ [.CAFE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cafe)
+ [.EAT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-eat)
+ [.FOOD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-food)
+ [.KITCHEN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kitchen) - out now
+ [.PIZZA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza)

Pre-orders are open now, so get your restaurant's name on the list before they open to the public.
