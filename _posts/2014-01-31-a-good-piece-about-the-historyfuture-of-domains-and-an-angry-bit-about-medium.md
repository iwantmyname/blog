title: A good piece about the history/future of domains and an angry bit about Medium

[Great story about the history of domains over the last two decades from Morgan Linton:](https://medium.com/p/88e8ca7f407c)

I do have one beef with this article though. It's a great piece about having "more options than ever before," but it's written in Medium, a platform that takes your identity down to a social handle.

Medium isn't a gift to humanity, you guys. It's a place where good writers that used to get paid by publishers and ad revenue can post their work for free (with no personal branding). The authors here get nothing. [Medium was given $25 million this week.](http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/28/medium-raises-25m-so-founder-ev-williams-doesnt-have-to-keep-funding-it-himself/)
