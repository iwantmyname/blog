Did you know that there are 280 internet domain extensions in total? And that .COM & .NET account for 50% of all domains registered worldwide? Or maybe you have always wondered what the most popular country code domains are?

In our *Domain Statistics & Numbers* article series we will answer these questions and provide you with some interesting numbers around the global domain name space:

1.  **How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total?**
2.  [How many domains are registered worldwide](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domains-are-registered-in-total.html)?

### Part 1: How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total?

As you can see we have **280 domain extensions in total**. The two main groups are the so-called gTLDs (generic top-level domains) and the ccTLDs (country code top-level domains). We will go into more detail about gTLD and ccTLD registration numbers later.

**Generic top-level domains:**

The 20 generic TLD suffixes are used mostly internationally and represent the vast majority of all registered domains worldwide. They are divided into:

*   4 unrestricted TLDs:  [.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial ".COM Domain"), [.NET](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network ".NET Domain"), [.ORG](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation ".ORG Domain") & [.INFO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information ".INFO domain") (can be purchased by anyone without any restrictions)
*   3 Generic-restricted TLDs: [.BIZ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business ".BIZ Domain") (for Businesses), [.NAME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names ".NAME domain") (for Individuals) & .PRO (for credentialed professionals)
*   13 Sponsored TLDs: .AERO, [.ASIA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia ".ASIA Domain"), .CAT, .COOP, .EDU (US only), .GOV (US only), .INT, .JOBS, .MIL (US only), [.MOBI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mobi-domain-name-registration-for-mobile ".MOBI domain"), .MUSEUM, [.TEL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication ".TEL Domain") & .TRAVEL

**Country code top-level domains:**

The countries of this world are represented on the internet by 248 ccTLDs altogether:

*   242 are based on the official English short names after the ISO 3166-1 standard. The [list of all country code extensions](http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ "IANA root zone database") can be found in the IANA root zone database.
*   Exceptionally reserved codes are: [.AC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island ".AC Domain") (Ascension Island), [.EU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe ".EU Domain") (European Union) & [.UK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom ".UK Domain") (United Kingdom, offical ISO short name is GB)
*   Former country codes: .SU (Soviet Union), .TP (Portuguese Timor, now [.TL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste ".TL Domain Registration") for Timor-Leste) & .YU (Yugoslavia, split into [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro ".ME Domain") for Montenegro and .RS for Serbia)

**New top-level domain extensions (outlook):**

It will be interesting to see how the [new top-level domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html "New domain extensions") will change the domain landscape. If ICANN sticks to its current plan to [expand the internet address space](http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtld-program.htm "New gTLD program") with new addresses such as .BERLIN, .NYC or .RADIO next year, we should see a completely different picture in about 3 years. The 20 "g"s could be more like 200-500 then and will surpass the country codes by far on the long run.

**What is your prediction for the number of TLDs by the end of 2012? We'd love to see them in the comments.**
