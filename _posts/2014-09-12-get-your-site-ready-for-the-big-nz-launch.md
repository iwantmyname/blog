Our US customers might have a hard time wrapping their heads around this, but local websites in much of the world end with something like this—.CO.NZ. But the days of ".CO" littering otherwise clean domains seems to be coming to an end. The United Kingdom recently opened up their [.UK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) second-level domains, and New Zealand is now following suit.

Starting 30 September at 1pm NZDT, .NZ will be available to everyone on a first come, first served basis ([pre-registration](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) is still open!). But current owners of .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ and .NET.NZ websites will have the ability to reserve their corresponding .NZ domain names for a limited time. Here are the rules.

<!-- /excerpt -->

##How to get your corresponding .NZ domain name

First, [check your "right of registration status"](http://anyname.nz/index.html) which can be one of the following:

+ Preferential Registration or Reservation (PRR) --  these are names that you are entitled to [register](http://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) before anyone else.
+ Conflicted -- existing names that have more than one domain owner entitled to register them. 
+ Available to anyone -- domains that were registered after Feb 11, 2014 are available to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis. We recommend [placing a pre-order for such .nz domains](http://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) to be first in line.

Optionally, you can reserve your corresponding domain for up to two years without purchasing it through [anyname.nz](http://anyname.nz/) (not affiliated with iwantmyname). You must do this before 30 March 2015 though, so if this is the path you want to take, don't let it slip by.

***

This is a big deal for the world of New Zealand websites, so if you have any questions about the launch or your specific domain's status, please [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
