Popular URL shortening service [bit.ly](http://bit.ly "bit.ly") is launching an [open beta](http://blog.bit.ly/post/356400453/bit-ly-pro-open-beta-and-enterprise-service "bit.ly Pro open beta") of its long-awaited Pro version with custom domain option soon. This will allow you to use your own domain name for a personally branded URL instead of the standard shortened addresses starting with bit.ly or j.mp.

*   bit.ly Pro is completely free and has the following features included:
*   10,000 requests / day for your custom short URL
*   Access to the bit.ly Pro dashboard with detailed statistics on your branded links
*   bit.ly button to allow users share links on Twitter / Facebook with your custom domain

There will also be an Enterprise edition with support for multiple domains, advanced dashboard features, full end-to-end branding and a customer service support plan.

### Short URL Domain Name Ideas

We have some domain name ideas for you to find a memorable short domain. You should try to keep it simple yet still readable. Do not obsess to much about the length, 5-7 characters will still work fine. It is not so much the brevity that is important but the recognition value of your brand.

1.  **Use abbreviations / misspellings**

	- Company: comp or cmpny
	- YourDesignBlog: yodebl or yrdsgn
	- iWantMyName: iwmn

2.  **Play with initials:**

    - FirstnameLastname: FL or FiLa
	- New York Agency: NYA

3.  **Find a domain hack:**

    - iPeople: ipeo.pl
	- Youtube: youtu.be
	- YourName: yrna.me (domain hack / misspelling combined)

4.  **Register a boutique domain extension**

    - [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) (It's me...)
	- [.IM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man) (I'm)
	- [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) (Input/Output)
	- [.TW](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tw-taiwanese-domain-name-registration-for-taiwan) (for Twitter!)

5.  **Get creative using Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)**

    Symbols / special characters: ✪df.ws or [20°f.la](https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=20°f.la)
[Upside down domain names](https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/name-generator/turn-words-upside-down): ǝɯɐu.name (name.name) or ʇɹoɥs.com (short.com)

**With iWantMyName you can easily find and [set up domains for bit.ly](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service "Domains for bit.ly").
