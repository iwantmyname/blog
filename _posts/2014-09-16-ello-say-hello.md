From Gabriel Weinberg's Blog, in an article titled, "[What I use instead of Google services](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2014/09/what-i-use-instead-of-google-services.html)"

>Like most people, I don't like to be tracked more than I need to be. I believe in privacy policies that do the minimum collection needed as opposed to the maximum collection possible. I am also the founder of the search engine that doesn't track you, DuckDuckGo. For these reasons, I personally don't use Google services where I don't absolutely have to, and honestly it's not very hard to do because there are good alternatives. I get asked a lot what I use instead of Google services, and this post answers that question.

I don't think I need to introduce the importance of reducing unnecessary data collection in today's internet, but knowing which platforms to use can be tricky. The linked article above does a wonderful job listing out some great services for storage, cloud docs, email platforms, etc., so be sure to give it a read. But I just have one little addendum.

###Social media: [Ello](https://ello.co/)

Yes, another social media platform. But after personally using Ello for a month or so, I'm really excited about the community they're building. I'm also a big fan of the [manifesto](https://ello.co/manifesto):

>Your social network is owned by advertisers.
>
>Every post you share, every friend you make and every link you follow is tracked, recorded and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.
>
>We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.
>
>We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce and manipulate — but a place to connect, create and celebrate life.
>
>You are not a product.

Ello is still in beta at the moment, but if you're already signed up, [please say hi](https://ello.co/iwantmyname)! And if you need an invite, just drop us a line in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname).
