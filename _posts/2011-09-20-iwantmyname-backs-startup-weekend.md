Startup Weekend is a global initiative that sees entrepreneurial developers, designers and business heads conceptualise, build and launch a tech venture over the space of a single weekend. We've been involved with the New Zealand events from day one with our free domain name offer for participating teams.

We recently also supported teams at Startup Weekend Mega, based in Silicon Valley. "Creativity occurs when ideas have sex", says Tony Young Lyu whose company AdGame was [born at SW Mega](http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/14/adgame-goes-from-zero-to-startup-hero-in-one-week/) and went on to be showcased at Demo Conference later that same week. Startup Weekend offers a supported environment for emerging tech entrepreneurs to network, build teams and meet amazing mentors, advisors and sometimes even investors.

Because we know how challenging it is to cut through the noise, build and launch a company on the web, we think Startup Weekend is a great project to get behind. Apart from our free domain offer, we're involved in the New Zealand SW organising team and we have posted some great [online resources](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html) for budding entrepreneurs. Of course, we also recommend a swag load of [developer apps](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) to help you build stuff.

[Auckland](http://auckland.startupweekend.org/) Startup Weekend - 23-25 September

[Wellington](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) Startup Weekend - 4-6 November

We are offering a free one year registration of a .COM, .NET, .ORG or .ME domain name for each of the teams that goes beyond the Friday evening selection rounds. Event organisers will supply a code word so team members can [contact us](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) to claim their domain during the weekend.
