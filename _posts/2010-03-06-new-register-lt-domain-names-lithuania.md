The [Lithuanian country domain .LT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lt-lithuanian-domain-name-registration-for-lithuania) is the latest addition to the growing [list of international domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) offered at iWantMyName. Lithuania is a member state of the European Union and situated in Northern Europe. Domain names from Lithuania can be registered worldwide without any restrictions or local requirements.

.LT also supports [Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)](https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names) with the special Lithuanian characters (ą, č, ę, ė, į, š, ų, ū, ž). There are currently 111,767 registered domains in total ([Statistics](http://www.domreg.lt/public?pg=CFF17D)).
