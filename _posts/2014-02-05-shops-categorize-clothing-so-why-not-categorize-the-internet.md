title: Shops categorize .CLOTHING because each item is different, so why not categorize the internet?

For many site owners, the dream of these [new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) is to categorize the internet. To give each brand the chance to differentiate itself from the rest of its field, not the rest of the internet.

But today, the norm is to begin a site as a .COM, then potentially move to a few other TLDs like .CO and .TV to protect the brand. And that's worked fine up to now, but we're we're simply running out of .COM names to give out. Still in the relative infancy of the internet, we've already run out of two, three and [four letter](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html) .COM domains, and it's only a matter of time before the five-letter combinations are gone.

From a site discovery standpoint, where does that leave us?

Say you're starting a clothing company called Simple, and are looking to create your first company website. Simple.com is already taken by a (wonderfully designed) US bank, so that's out. SimpleBrand.com looks like a branding studio of sorts, so that's out. Simpleclothing.com looks like it's been grabbed by squatters, so that's out. How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go? Simpleclothingforhumans.com? Who's going to find that?

With the [.CLOTHING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing) TLD though, the choice is much...simpler—simple.clothing. And even if simple.clothing is taken, the competition for similar terms will be much lower, given that you won't be competing with banks and production studios for names in the clothing category.

There are [more than two billion people using the internet today](http://www.thecultureist.com/2013/05/09/how-many-people-use-the-internet-more-than-2-billion-infographic/), so it's inevitable that there's going to be some crossover in the use of common words and phrases for websites. That's why we need these gTLDs—to make it ok for brands to segment into different industries. We need more than .COM, and if enough people make a change, we can create an internet with quite a bit more free space.

The fate of each TLD though lies in the democratic process. Every vote for a domain like .CLOTHING makes that TLD *that much* more relevant to the general public. And if enough users from platforms like [Big Cartel](https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain) or [Shopify](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software) join in to help push adoption, it'll be that much more likely to get big.

By this time next year, I truly hope the internet is a more open space, with more domains that aren't forced into odd naming conventions. It'll be better for all of us. But it's up to you to make it work.
