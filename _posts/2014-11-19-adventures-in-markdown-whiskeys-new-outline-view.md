title: "Adventures in Markdown: Whiskey's new outline view"
excerpt: no

Some people have gambling addictions, some struggle with caffeine—my vice is Markdown apps. Much like the Twitter apps of yore (or the podcast apps of today), Markdown apps are a wonderland for developers to implement tiny-but-genius improvements to a fairly rigid set of rules. Apps like Mou (Mou 1.0 hit its [funding goal](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you)!), Marked, and Byword are in constant rotation on my computer, and I’m always on the hunt for the next new creation. 

One thing that’s always bugged me though with Markdown apps is their inability to organize longform content. I'm not talking about 1,000 word posts here—I mean book-length content. You can use all the header sizes you want, but without a way to visually see an outline and quickly move between sections and chapters, I just can't see myself completely deleting the old, bloated word processors that still plague my hard drive. 

But there's a new Markdown app in town I'm really excited about—[Whiskey](http://usewhiskey.com). It's still in beta, but developer [Sam Soffes](http://soff.es) (who worked on Hipstamatic, Roon, Cheddar, and the deceptively brilliant Shares) seems to be adding a lot of the things I've been yearning for. Most notably (at least to me), a slick outline view you can toggle with a hotkey. 

Here's a video example (from the dev):

Whiskey clearly isn't a finished product yet, but it's pretty functional in it's [current form](http://usewhiskey.com/beta). So if you're a fan of Markdown apps, I definitely recommend checking out the outline view implementation in the latest version. It's pretty slick.
