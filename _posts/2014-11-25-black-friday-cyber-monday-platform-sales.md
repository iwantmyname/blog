<!-- excerpt -->

Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend is right around the corner (Nov 27 - Dec 1), and if previous years are any indication, it could be a good time to start a website or check out a new web service.

We'll be updating this page throughout the week as sales are announced, so be on the lookout. Also, if you have (or know of) a deal we're not listing, [let us know](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname).
