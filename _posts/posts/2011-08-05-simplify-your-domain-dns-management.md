We've just begun offering [managed DNS hosting](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dns) for domains not already registered through iWantMyName. So you can now manage domain names independently from a registrar or registry, as well as benefit from easy domain customisation of your preferred apps offered on the [iWantMyName marketplace](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services).

The new low cost DNS hosting add-on allows you to set A, CNAME, MX, AAAA, SRV, TXT, NAPTR record types in real-time and make use of URL forwarding services. Additional domain information such as current registrar, ownership details and expiration dates are also provided to users who purchase this service. You can effectively aggregate the management of any domains that you already 
have sitting with multiple registrar providers.

[Open](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin) a free account at iWantMyName, then purchase the DNS hosting add-on ($3.50/yr) for the domain you would like to manage via your iWantMyName dashboard. Then apply the desired DNS or URL forwarding settings and switch the nameservers to ns1/2/3/4.iwantmyname.net over at your current registrar. Get centralised [Hosted DNS](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dns) for your domains with iWantMyName now.
