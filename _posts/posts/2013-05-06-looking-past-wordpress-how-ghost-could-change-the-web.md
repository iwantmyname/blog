WordPress has been around for so long that it's hard to remember a time where it didn't exist. Rightfully so, too, with the blogging platform [running over 65 Million websites](http://en.wordpress.com/stats/) around the world.

The problem with WordPress is that it's grown into a big, unwieldy platform that tries to do everything. In my opinion, it's getting tired and a bit old and one can tell from the administration interface that it's a bit dated. 

Enter: [Ghost](http://tryghost.com). An all new blogging platform that's being built from the ground up for the modern web. The blogging platform -- which is currently only in prototype form -- is [being Kickstarted](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform) right now. What's amazing, is that the team behind the new platform had originally set out to get £25,000 to get started but has already blown away that goal (to the tune of £94,000 at time of writing) with 24 days still left to go.

It's easy to see why Ghost is gaining popularity so fast, though. It's clean, designed with writing in mind, has a beautiful administration dashboard and is clearly designed for the modern web. Not only does it integrate with Facebook and Twitter, it's fully optimized for search out of the box and is designed for mobile from the ground up.

Perhaps one of the biggest things about Ghost that's helping gain traction is a partnership with WooThemes, which means the theme service will be creating themes for Ghost from the get go. Ghost is aiming for WordPress with their offerings too: it's open source, but a hosted offering is available with exclusive functionality (such as automated backups) for a price.

If you back Ghost on Kickstarter, depending on how much you contribute, you'll gain early access and will be able to start building later this year. If you're as sold as we are, [back the team behind Ghost now](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform).
