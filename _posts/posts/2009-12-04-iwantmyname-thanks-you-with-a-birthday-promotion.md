title: iWantMyName Thanks You with a Birthday Domain Promotion

categories:
  - Special Offer

---

_It has been a fascinating journey since we launched iWantMyName almost one year ago today. When we began, there were some very dark clouds looming over the global economy. We began to question if we had got our timing correct. But we received so much positive feedback from our customers that we knew we just had to press ahead.

We make no apologies for the fact that iWantMyName is about changing the face of domain management. Rest assured that our technical team have big plans for 2010 as we continue to add fantastic new services and functionality to the site. We also want to hear from you, our valued customers. If you have any technical issues or complaints, please do let us know. Also, if you had a good experience, we'd love you to share with others.

Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable festive season from the iWantMyName team and we look forward to a fantastic 2010!
