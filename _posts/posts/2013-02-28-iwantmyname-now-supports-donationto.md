We're excited to announce the addition of [DonationTo](http://www.donationto.com) to the iwantmyname hosted services marketplace!

DonationTo is a great, simple way to accept donations online towards your cause. It's as simple as setting up a page explaining why you need donations and then sharing it with your friends.

If they choose to donate, they're able to choose from rewards for donating. Think of it as the Kickstarter for good causes! The platform has previously been used for all sorts of fundraisers, such as assisting children with cancer, funding healing processes for people involved in car accidents and helping out those affected by natural disasters, such as the [Nakhon Sawan Flood](http://www.donationto.com/blog/fundraising-ideas-help-with-natural-disaster/) in 2011.

With the iwantmyname marketplace, it's as simple as buying a domain, heading to the setup tab of your account and choosing DomainTo from the [list of services](https://iwantmyname.com/services). The rest of the magic is done by us, and you don't need to know HTML or DNS to get going.

If you've got a great cause you want to contribute to, [make sure to try out DonationTo today](https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/register-domain-donationto).
