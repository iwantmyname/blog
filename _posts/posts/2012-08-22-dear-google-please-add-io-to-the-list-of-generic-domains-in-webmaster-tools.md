title: Dear Google, Please Add .IO To The List Of Generic Domains In Webmaster Tools

categories:
  - .io domains
  - SEO

---

Google [Webmaster Tools](http://google.com/webmastertools) is a free service allowing site owners to check certain metrics and adjust settings, e.g. search engine crawling errors or managing the robots.txt file. The service also lets you geo-target domains, for example, if you are using a .com domain, you can tell Google how the site should appear in their search results for specific geographic regions:

{% include youtube.html id="r9r3PayqaZM" %}

Usually country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as [.DE (Germany)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany) or [.ES (Spain)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain) cannot be targeted to an international audience but there are a [few exceptions](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1347922):

.AS, [.BZ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize), [.CC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands), .CD, [.CO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia), .DJ, [.FM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia), [.LA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos), [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro), [.MS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat), [.NU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nu-domain-name-registration-for-niue), [.SC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sc-seychellois-domain-name-registration-for-seychelles), .SR, [.TV](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu), [.TK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau), [.WS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa)

For all these TLDs you can set a geographic target through Webmaster Tools, e.g. use a .CO domain in the United States or Canada although it is actually the official domain extension of Colombia. 

Now recently the owner of [pineapple.io](http://pineapple.io) contacted us asking:

> Hey, I purchased a .io domain. I know you arent an SEO company but i was wondering, given that you are domain experts, do you know if there were any plans to make .io a gTLD? ... It's a shame that I can't really target the US, DESPITE the fact that it is used as a domain hack for many tech websites.

We think it's a really good question and have been wondering this for a while at iwantmyname, especially since the British Indian Ocean Territory is currently only inhabited by military personnel. The company behind registry service Nic.io also is one of the largest DNS infrastructure providers worldwide which guarantees stable technical operation of the [.IO TLD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory).

Most importantly there is an ever growing [list of international startups using .IO domains](http://www.quora.com/Which-companies-use-io-domains) and at the time of writing this article, popular tech news aggregator [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) had four(!) .IO sites ([meetings.io](http://meetings.io), [filepicker.io](http://filepicker.io), [bloc.io](http://bloc.io), [avatars.io](http://avatars.io)) on their front page. We also have popular open source projects [redis.io](http://redis.io) or [socket.io](http://socket.io), blogging services [soup.io](http://soup.io) or [pen.io](http://pen.io) and many, many more.

Please join our appeal to Google to add [.IO domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) as a generic country code top-level domain in Webmaster Tools and show your support by leaving a comment or sharing this article!
