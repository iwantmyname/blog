Goodness knows why banks insist on printing lovely pictures on our credit cards, since our cards spend 99% of the time in the dark, wedged tightly inside our wallets. I guess it differentiates one credit card provider from another and it's a bit of fun showing off picture cards to friends. What is not so fun however is the hangover from posting an image of your lovely credit card online.

Surely nobody would be so foolish? But, it happens a lot more often than you may think. Some folks just cannot resist the temptation to share their latest pictorial acquisition with billions of other internet users. The implications are obvious. Sooner or later some clever little fellow is going to get his grubby hands on your personal billing data.

There's only one answer to this problem - [cancel that card](http://cancelthat.cc/) with their cleverly named domain cancelthat.cc! It's a website that reminds us of the dangers involved in exposing your credit card details anywhere. Even better, there's a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cancelthatcard) that detects newly published card images and tweets a warning to the user. We think that's a pretty cool idea. 

As a company dealing with thousands of credit card transactions each month, we are very mindful of the dangers and heartily endorse more education about keeping credit card information secure. So we sponsored a [domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/domains) for the site as part of our support for initiatives within the developer community.
