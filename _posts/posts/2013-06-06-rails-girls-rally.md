There's been a lot of discussion recently about getting more young people interested in software development and in particular getting more women into the game. Whichever way you look at it, there's no denying that the developer scene is predominantly a male one. Show up to any hackathon and 90% or more of the players will be guys. Boring!!

There's probably many social factors that have led to this dire state of affairs, but if we are to build a truly knowledge based economy, then it's important women who are interested have the opportunity to participate in non-traditional roles in the technology sector. That's why we are excited about [Rails Girls Wellington](http://railsgirls.com/wellington) who are providing a workshop this weekend to encourage women to join the engaging and rewarding world of code. 

The session matches newbie Rails coders with highly experienced mentors and the particular focus involves creating a simple application and hosting it with Heroku. That's a subject dear to our hearts because at iwantmyname we make it easy for developers to [domain customise apps hosted on Heroku](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain) as well as a bunch of [other](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) hosting services.

With [Google's recent elevation of .IO domains](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/05/io-domains-now-more-awesome.html) to planetoid status, we thought it timely to offer a cool .IO domain name as a spot prize for the Rails Girls Weekend Workshop. Even with our current [.IO domain special](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory), that's a tasty prize! What more could a Rails Girl want?
