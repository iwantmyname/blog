title: Download The QR Code For Your Domain Name

categories:
  - New feature
  - QR code

---

You can now download an auto-generated QR code for every domain name in your iWantMyName dashboard. QR codes or 2D barcodes are square images that can contain different data, e.g. URLs, an email address or phone numbers. The "QR" stands for "Quick Response" and was created by Japanese corporation Denso-Wave in 1994. They are very common in Japan already but start gaining popularity in the western world as well with the wide adoption of the iPhone and Android-powered mobile camera phones such as Google's Nexus One.

Your domain QR code can be obtained by clicking on the respective domain name in the iWantMyName dashboard. Feel free to download, print or put it on a sticker.

There are many use cases for QR codes. One of our favorite blogs ReadWriteWeb had an excellent article series on "The Scannable World":

The iWantMyName crew will be at the [LCA2010 Open Day](http://lca2010.org.nz) on Saturday 23rd January at the Wellington Town Hall. Be sure to stop by our booth, supply us with your favourite URL address and we will print a free QR code sticker for you.
