title: .COM too expensive? One new podcast went with .LIMO and .DIAMONDS

---

For the "do domain extensions really matter" archives. [Gimlet Media](http://gimletmedia.com) just announced its first new podcast yesterday, Reply All. We're not a podcast review site so I won't go into details (tldr: it's a great, story based podcast about the internet), but there's one line in the end credits of the first episode I absolutely loved.

>Do not go to replyall.com. It's too expensive. We didn't want to buy it. Instead, we bought replyall.limo and replyall.diamonds.

Make of it what you will, but I'd say this is a case of "if your thing is popular, people will find you." Don't sacrifice your sane brand name because the .com is taken—there are plenty of alternative domain extensions out there, and if what you do is good, people will find you in your corner of the internet.
