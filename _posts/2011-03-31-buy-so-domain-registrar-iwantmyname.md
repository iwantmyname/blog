As of April 1 you will be able to [purchase .SO domain names](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/so-somali-domain-name-registration-for-somalia), the official country code extension of Somalia at iWantMyName. The .SO web address is newly introduced and apart from being used in the African country it should also offer plenty of opportunities to register [cool domain hacks](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html). It is a completely unrestricted country code top-level domain meaning anybody can buy the Somali internet extension.

.SO domains are available on a first come, first serve basis at an affordable $25.00 USD. And if you have registered your .SO domain with another registrar, you can [transfer them at only $20.00](https://iwantmyname.com.dev.domarino.com/domains/so-domain-registrar-transfer-somalia) throughout April and May 2011. So don't wait (no pun intended) and [get your own .SO web address today](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/so-somali-domain-name-registration-for-somalia)!
