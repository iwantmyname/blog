**Guest post from Oliver Townend writing about his experiences as a web company founder.**

Toward the end of 2011 I had an idea for an on-line business that seemed to make perfect sense. It grew out of a situation I have been frustrated by repeatedly in my time as a building contractor. It made use of existing technology and it had a potential target market that grew every time I bothered to think about it.

I was excited, finally I had an idea that worked. I brainstormed and refined and built on the basic concept to the point where I had (in my head) a hugely complicated product packed full of exciting features and backed up by some wildly optimistic financial predictions. There was one major problem however: I had no experience of start-ups and absolutely no idea how to make it happen.

The concept itself is fine. In theory it works and there is a market for it. But if I couldn't build the product then it would only ever be an unrealised opportunity and one day someone else would do it. I'd get grumpy and resent them for it. I needed help. The first step was to tell people about it. Not in a comprehensive market validation way (I didn't read The Lean Startup till much later) but just to get different perspectives, discuss the concept and discover if there was merit in taking it further. 

I got myself a [business mentor](http://www.businessmentors.org.nz/) and told them about it. I asked around and found a couple of lawyers willing to meet informally and talk through the legal implications. I rang everyone I could think of who could possibly use this product and told them what I was trying to do. Most people recommended someone else to talk to.</span>

The feedback was fascinating. Ranging from "*Yes,
I want that, when can I have it?*" to "*No, I see no benefit in that*" and most interestingly "*I
can't talk to you about that, we're trying to do the same thing*". The positives maintained my enthusiasm. The negatives forced me to confront my deficiencies. The competitors proved that I wasn't the only person working on this and I needed to get moving. The hardest conversations revealed previously hidden problems and opportunities that have contributed hugely to the refinement process. Every time I explain or defend my theories I get better at it.</span> 

I realised several things very quickly:

1) The product needed to be simplified dramatically. What I thought was the key feature had been tried before, was fundamentally flawed and nearly impossible to execute. Another feature I hadn't given much thought to had much more promise.

2) No-one I spoke to was going to blatantly steal my idea, especially the sort of busy, technical people who could if they wanted to. They have other things going on. I have a head start at working on figuring it out, the more I get done on my own the more likely it is that I'll have something valuable in the future.

3) I had a lot of work to do and no time to do it, I was already running a business and had no spare time to spend working on the new one.

4) I needed to talk to a lot more people.

5) I needed collaborators. Technical collaborators...more about this next time.
