<!-- excerpt -->

As a New Zealand-based domain registrar, it's no secret that we have a soft spot for our domestic domains. And with .NZ coming out soon, we reached out to Patrick Watson of the [Domain Name Commission Ltd (DNCL)](http://dnc.org.nz) to get all the details about the upcoming launch.

<!-- /excerpt -->

**iwmn:** Generally competition is seen as a good thing, but how do you expect the New Zealand domain market to change once .NZ and .KIWI are both live? Which will capture the local imagination?

**Patrick:** Competition has always existed in the .nz domain name space and so .kiwi's entrance into the market isn't anything new. In fact, we welcome the competition. Looking into the future, no one can really predict how the public will see .kiwi in relation to .nz or what will happen in New Zealand's domain name market.  This is particularly true against the backdrop of all the other gTLDs that will be rolled out over the next few years.

Ultimately we believe people get domain names that seem most relevant to them and speak to their unique identity or purpose. How they come to this decision is entirely their own, but the Domain Name Commission urges people to make informed decisions, do their own research, and
see what makes sense to them.

Having said all this, last year a [Colmar Brunton survey](http://www.getyourselfonline.co.nz/sites/default/files/nzrs_report_FINAL_v2_0_0.pdf) polled 1,001 people and 517 business people. This was before the .kiwi launch. From this research it was found that New Zealand consumers much preferred .nz websites to .com ones and that both New Zealand businesses and consumers perceived .nz as local, friendly, trusted and
familiar. We also found consumers preferred to use .nz websites over .com ones. 

Because of all these factors we are sure .nz domain names will stay appealing and relevant, even with .kiwi in the marketplace.

**iwmn:** What are the growth expectations for .NZ? And how long to you think it'll take it to take over .CO.NZ in the everyday lexicon?

**Patrick:** It is difficult to predict how consumers will respond to registrations directly at the second level, how they'll casually speak about it, or how the marketplace will react. If you studied how all .nz second levels performed when first introduced, you'd find all types of trends. Similarly .nz registrations directly at the second level will follow their own natural course as dictated by market forces and consumer behaviour.

In terms of overall .nz growth, which includes all second levels, the .nz domain name space has doubled in size over the last six years. And, in the 2012-2013 financial year, the .nz space experienced a 10.16% growth from the year before.  At the very minimum, DNCL expects these growth trends to remain.  Given the significance of allowing registrations directly at the second level, though, our gut feeling is that .nz growth will increase more than typical in the short term following this decision. As we also believe there is still an important place for second levels within the .nz domain name space, we simultaneously think that they too will grow with time. [Here's a link to all of the DNCL's statistics](http://dnc.org.nz/content/fy_stats.html).

**iwmn:** So what happens to existing .CO.NZ domains now? Will there be a grandfathering period? Priority registration?

It is important to note that no change will be made to existing second levels - all existing domain names will continue to be available, and people will still be able to register new domain names in second level categories like .co.nz, .org.nz, etc. DNCL will also continue to expand the choice of second levels as appropriate.

In early 2014, a final policy implementing the proposal will be subject to public consultation and it will explain in detail what will happen to existing .nz registrants. What is unlikely to change is what is explained in our existing [FAQ section](http://dnc.org.nz/faq-registrations-directly-second-level?m=635), which states that anyone who held a .nz domain name prior to 9am on 30 May 2012 will have access, or be eligible to, some sort of preferential registration. They will fit into two categories: Competing Registrants and Non-Competing Registrants.

If a Registrant got their domain name before 9am on Wednesday 30 May, 2012, and no one else registered that same name in another second level category before this date, they are non-competing Registrants. Those who fall into this category will be informed of this. These people will be given the option to register their name in a preferential registration period, or reserve their name for up to two years at no charge. DNCL research shows that over 90% of existing names are in this category.

If two or more Registrants registered a domain name under different second levels - and they did so before 9am on Wednesday 30 May, 2012 - they will be considered a 'Competing Registrant'. An example of this would be one person having anyname.co.nz and a second person having anyname.net.nz. Anyone who falls into this category will be informed of this fact. Without going into too much detail, these people would either get consent from the other registrants and register their
domain name at the second level or give up their rights to it altogether. Please note that even if they give up their rights to their name at the second level, they will continue to be able to use their existing .nz domain name. If no agreement can be reached and the
name remains conflicted, then no one will be able to register it. Our research shows less than 10% of names fall into this category.

As mentioned previously, though, the final consultation policy - which will outline what will happen to all .nz registrants - won't happen until early next year.

**iwmn:** A lot of people not in the industry probably wonder why .NZ didn't exist from the start--it seems to a far superior TLD than .CO.NZ. Can you talk us through that history a bit?

**Patrick:** The background to the .nz domain name space stems from when Waikato University ran the .nz domain name space. In fact, in the early days a consortium of universities made decisions around the structure of .nz.  Later, InternetNZ entered into an arrangement with ICANN to hold delegation over the .nz domain name space.

Like a lot of other countries at the time, registrations at the third level were common practice and had precedents in other email addressing systems in operation at the time in the UK and Europe. Our understanding is that the original hierarchical structure was intended to differentiate the ccTLDs from the gTLDs such as .com and other ones
around at the time. In the years that have passed, however, things have changed. Indeed, a number of other countries have also changed their policies to allow registrations directly at the second level and New Zealand's doing the same will introduce a format to .nz that is common with many other ccTLDs.

With the benefit of hindsight, it easy to look back and think about how improvements might have been made.  Armed with this knowledge, if we were starting today we probably would do things differently. For
open registrations we probably would have allowed registrations at the second level from day one. However, we also believe there is a place for moderated spaces like .govt and .health and we would keep this policy for similarly appropriate bodies.

With the changes we're making today we think we are offering the best of both worlds and that allowing registrations at the second and third level will allow people to identify with existing second levels or dissociate with them if they don't. For example, businesses can still identify themselves as a company by using .co.nz and oganisations can do the same with .org.nz. However if you're neither of these things - and no other second level speaks to you - you could go straight to registering at the second level. From our perspective, this approach offers more choice and benefits to everyone.

**iwmn:** And finally, aside from launching .NZ, tell us more about what DNC does and how it is different from NZRS and InternetNZ. What are the big issues of today and tomorrow?

**Patrick:** InternetNZ (Internet New Zealand Inc) manages the .nz domain name space and established two subsidiary companies, Domain Name Commission Ltd (DNCL) and NZ Domain Name Registry Ltd (NZRS), to carry out the
management and day-to-day operations. This leaves the InternetNZ Council to maintain a governance overview.

DNCL is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the .nz domain name registration and management system.  NZRS is responsible for the register of domain names and the operation of the Domain Name System (DNS) in the .nz domain name space

By far and away DNCL's biggest issue right now is .nz registrations directly at the second level. In fact, it's the most significant policy change in our history and we received more submissions on this issue than any previous consultation process. Co-ordinating this change, allowing for the technical aspects of it and alerting the public to the change will no doubt take up much of our focus for 2014. Another priority for us is encouraging Registrars towards DNSSEC-friendly status so that .nz domain name holders are both safer
and more secure.
