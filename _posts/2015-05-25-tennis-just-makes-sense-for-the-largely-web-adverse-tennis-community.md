<!-- excerpt -->

Among the [hundreds of TLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) (the part after the dot, like COM in .COM) available now, sports TLDs are some of the hardest to find uses for. At this point, many of the world's major sports leagues are enormous commercial entities, making .COM an ideal solution. Individual players are also unlikely to come over in droves, given the extreme specificity of an ending like .TENNIS. But [.TENNIS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tennis) in particular does have a couple important uses—providing open namespaces for local tennis associations/clubs and tournaments.

<!-- /excerpt -->

### .TENNIS for local tennis associations/clubs

Like many sports associations, organized tennis is a big tangle of domain naming practices. Long names, assorted TLDs, jumbled words—it's a mess. For example, here are a few from around the world:

+ the Wellington Tennis Club uses wellingtontennisclub.org.nz
+ the Auckland Tennis Association uses tennisauckland.co.nz (notice the .co.nz instead of the .org.nz Wellington uses)
+ the Houston Tennis Association uses houstontennis.org
+ the Ontario Tennis Association uses tennisontario.com

Instead of these assorted naming practices, imagine if they all used this—cityname.TENNIS? It's nice and short, and aside from small cities with the same names as larger cities, the naming could be standardized around the world.

### .TENNIS for tournaments

Just going through the USTA (US Tennis Association) Tennis Link, it's amazing how many local tournaments simply don't have websites. The tournament information pages clearly have a place for a tournament website to go, but more often than not, these tournaments are run, organized, and managed without a web presence (hopefully it's better in other countries). And that's insane. 

If anyone attached to a tennis tournament happens to read this, might I recommend creating a quick [website](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/) or [blog](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/) (we have so many available for one-click installs) and using a domain name like tournamentname.TENNIS? The younger generations would greatly appreciate it.
