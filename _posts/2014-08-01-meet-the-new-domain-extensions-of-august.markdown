<!-- excerpt -->

[July](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/meet-the-new-domain-extensions-of-july.html) was a bit of a slow month for new generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches, with only four cracking the 5,000-registrations mark [so far](http://ntldstats.com/): [.voting](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-voting), [.services](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-services), [.kaufen](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kaufen), and [.tokyo](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo), which is now the 20th most popular gTLD overall. But things may be looking up for August, with nine gTLDs containing less than five characters (it's thought that four or less may be the sweet spot for TLD popularity).

Especially interesting is the August 13th launch of four medical-specific gTLDs: [.care](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-care), [.clinic](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clinic), [.dental](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dental), and [.surgery](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-surgery). The usefulness of being able to type in something like LOCATION.clinic to get a relevant result is undeniable, so it wouldn't be at all surprising to see some of these take off.

***

As you may have noticed, the big hole in this August list are new city gTLDs—you'll have to wait until September 9th for [.london](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london), then September 15th for [.vegas](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas). Seeing the popularity of [.berlin](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin) and [.tokyo](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo), I expect to see big-city TLDs dominating [this list](http://ntldstats.com/tld) by the end of the year.
