title: The gang assembles (in Wellington)

---

In the last 2-3 years, we've quietly transitioned from a group entirely based in Wellington to a global team covering time zones all over the world. We now have 12 iwantmynamers: 7 in New Zealand, 2 in the US, 1 splitting time between the US and New Zealand, 1 in Canada, and 1 in Germany.

Being all over the world makes it easy (or at least, easier) to handle support at all times of the day and to get different perspectives of the culture we're in. But it also comes with challenges. For instance, when the NZ team wants after-work beers, the sun is just coming up for Steffi. And when Kevin has a good design to show off on Friday, it's already Saturday in NZ. So a couple times a year it's nice to get everyone together for a week or twoâ€”like a big team recalibration.

One of our main focuses though is to find better ways to communicate and share ideas. Lots of tools, lots of ideas. Here are some highlights:

+ We're trying to fold all our content tools into GitHub, because GitHub makes GitHub with Github, and we mostly like GitHub
+ Sharing wireframes and designs is tough, so we're trying out a local company/tool, [Atomic](https://atomic.io)
+ Getting weekly team face time is a priority, but maybe a mandatory weekly meeting isn't the best way to build organic trust?
+ Slack has made group chat rooms all the rage, but we've been using HipChat for quite a while. Can we do all we need to do with it?
