It's often the little tools that make the services we love really useful. Therefore we've added another way to check domain availability at iWantMyName. With the domain search bookmarklet you can **select any word or text in a browser window and click on the bookmarklet to check whether the respective domain is available or not**.

To install the domain search bookmarklet you just have to drag the following link to your bookmarks bar:

**[Domain Search](javascript:Qr=document.getSelection();if(!Qr){void(Qr=prompt( "Domain Search Bookmarklet")**

You should also visit our new [domain tools overview](https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools "Domain Search Tools") page where we've listed all the other iWantMyName gadgets:
