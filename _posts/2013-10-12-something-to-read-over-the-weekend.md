Need something interesting to read this weekend? Here are some sites and articles we've been looking at this week.

<!-- /excerpt -->

From [Domains4good](http://www.domains4good.org/):

> Domains4Good puts unused domains to good use by redirecting them to top social causes. Social causes are selected and voted upon by the Domains4Good community, and each day a new social cause is featured across all domains in the network.

From Todd Hoff - [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/10/7/ask-hs-is-microsoft-the-right-technology-for-a-scalable-web.html):

> Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft licenses(OS, SQL Server, ...)?

From Damian Sowers - [Silvrback](https://dsowers.silvrback.com/silvrback-is-now-open-to-everyone):

> I'm proud to announce that Silvrback is out of the pre-order phase and is now open to everybody.

From Rob N - [FastMail](http://blog.fastmail.fm/2013/10/07/fastmails-servers-are-in-the-us-what-this-means-for-you/):

> As you may be aware, there have been many reports recently of secret data mining programs conducted by the US government. These reports have included mention of secret network interception and "backdoor" access to private email accounts. While we have no position on the veracity of these claims, we have had many queries about what, if anything, this might mean for us and for our customers, given that our primary servers are located in the US. This is our response to those questions.

From Rya Stansky - [Squarespace](http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-for-musicians):

> Since the launch of Squarespace 6, our aim has been to provide photographers, artists, and other creative professionals a better way to present their work online. Today, we're excited to announce more features for musicians, beginning with Audio Collections.

From Kyle York - [CircleID](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20131008_where_are_the_most_popular_websites_in_the_world_are_hosted/?utm_content=buffere625e&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer):

> Google is pretty much the dominant player worldwide with Baidu as the dominant force in China and Korea. But I couldn't help but wonder what the most popular website based in each country was. So, I put the Dyn research team to work and they came up with a comprehensive list.

From Chris Hall - [iwantmyname](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/10/iwantmyblog-the-blog-that-goes-everywhere.html):

> In the last decade, a lot has happened in the blogging world. Templates got better. Responsive design became a thing. Social media went bananas. There's quite a bit of catching up to do, and a ton of new blog platforms to try out. All said, it's going to take an incredible amount of time.

>So, to make it easier for myself, I'm giving each blog platform a solid week. With my trusty iwantmyblog.com domain name in hand, I'll work fast to build a basic site on Monday, spend the middle of the week writing about the platform and be out by the end of Friday. Then, with a clean URL and (hopefully) a mess of content in some sort of export file, I'll take my blog on the road to the next platform. And so on.

Happy reading... and have a great weekend!
