Now that we've gone through [setting up](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/10/getting-started-with-tumblr-iwantmyblog.html) and [writing on](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2013/10/adventures-in-writing-on-tumblr-iwantmyblog.html) your Tumblr blog (Tumblog), we need to work on making it your own.

So what makes Tumblr one of the most attractive platforms for ADD bloggers (aside from the plethora of posting options) is that the community is quite active and ready to contribute—meaning that there are plenty of themes available, free and paid. Here are a few good sites for finding the one that's right for you:

<!-- /excerpt -->

+ [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/themes/) - It's always a good idea to start at the source when looking for a theme. And there are plenty to find here, including many from the sites listed below.
+ [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/category/blogging/tumblr) - As massive and impersonal as Themeforest is, there are a ton of good themes available for Tumblr sites of all shapes and sizes.
+ [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/themes/tumblr) - Like Themeforest, Creative Market is filled with all sorts of themes from a collection of talented designers. And the prices are fairly cheap, which is always a plus. 
+ [Pixel Union](https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/tumblr) - If you're looking for something a little more consistently hipster (passing no judgement!), Pixel Union might be your best bet. They also have a number of grid themes that strike my fancy.
+ [Themecloud](http://themecloud.co/themes/) - Themecloud is yet another site with nice themes, but I especially appreciate the nice layout of the homepage. And, like Pixel Union, the variety of grid themes is quite impressive.

Of course, if you have some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, you can make your site look any way you want. [Here's a guide](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) to help you get going.
