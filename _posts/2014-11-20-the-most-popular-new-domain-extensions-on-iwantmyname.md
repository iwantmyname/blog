<!-- excerpt -->

According to [ntldstats.com](http://ntldstats.com/tld), there are 3,177,772 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) registered to date. What that says about the overall popularity of the rollout is up for debate, but there's no denying the success of some of the extensions. .XYZ, .CLUB, and a bunch of the city gTLDs are doing quite well, and even some of the less popular ones (62 at the moment) have broken the 10,000 registrations mark. 

But, at least for me, looking at an overall popularity list doesn't really say anything. I want to know what the people I identify with are using, and for that, I need some specific stats—stats from our customers. Here's what we found.

## Selected thoughts

The first thing that hit me after seeing the list was how different it was than the ntldstats [popularity list](http://ntldstats.com/tld). Here are a few of the more interesting findings. 

+ .XYZ is nowhere to be found on our list, but is clearly the most registered new gTLD on the web.
+ .BLUE is in our top 10, but is #120 overall. Perhaps our monthly [domain discounts](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer) are more popular than I thought.
+ We're clearly popular amongst creative professionals. .PHOTO, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .AGENCY, .GALLERY, .CLOTHING, .COMPANY, and .TECHNOLOGY are all in our top 25.
+ As well as education: .INSTITUTE, .ACADEMY, .EDUCATION
+ This was to be expected—.GURU and .EXPERT are both quite popular (we clearly have brilliant customers).
