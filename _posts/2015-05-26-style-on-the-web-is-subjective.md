<!-- excerpt -->

As far as TLDs go, style is an interesting word. It's not a job description or a thing you do—instead, it's more about a process. Style is the way you make something, or a specific form that's trying to be achieved. You can have good style, or you could have your haircuts styled a certain way. So what can you do with a .STYLE domain name?

### .STYLE blogs

Blogs, particularly online collections (think long Tumblr sites), are perhaps the best place for .STYLE domains to live. Unlike a business or brand, a style blog can be a collection of anything about a movement. Mid-century style could live on midcentury.STYLE. Your collection of Mannerist style architecture could easily find a home on mannerist.STYLE. Or if your love is typography, typographic.STYLE might be just what you're after.

### .STYLE is for writers

In the world of professional writing, style is what keeps the world consistent. But style reference books, like the AP Stylebook, Oxford Manual of Style, and the The Chicago Manual of Style, aren't exactly the easiest things to get through (the AP Stylebook is nearly 400 pages)—so this is where the internet comes in. There are style sites online for every type of writing you could imagine, and with a .STYLE domain, they could all move to a namespace free of clutter (and grammar mistakes). 

### .STYLE makes for a great domain hack
