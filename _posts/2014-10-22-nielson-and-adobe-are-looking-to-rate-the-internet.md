title: Nielson and Adobe are looking to rate the internet
excerpt: no

[From Wired:](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/nielsen-will-soon-rate-everything-web-videos-articles/)

>The Nielsen ratings have long held huge sway over the business of television, but television isn’t like it used to be. So, on Tuesday, Nielsen announced that it’s expanding its ratings system to all kinds of digital content to give both its creators and advertisers a more meaningful way to measure popularity in the online era.

>The most striking development in Adobe’s new system is that it’s designed for comparing disparate kinds of content. The new ratings, Nielsen says, can rank an online video next to a podcast next to an article. Unlike television or radio, the internet isn’t a medium that funnels just one format. The aim of Nielsen’s new ratings is to create a context to figure out what people care about online, regardless of what form it takes.

This is just a reminder that internet advertising is still in its infancy. It'll be interesting to see what the internet looks like in 20 years, once the big media entities switch their primary funding from TV to the web. The last two lines of the article say it all. 

>The old way made a lot of people in old media a lot of money. If someone can approximate the old way for new media, maybe more of that money will start rolling in, just like it used to.
