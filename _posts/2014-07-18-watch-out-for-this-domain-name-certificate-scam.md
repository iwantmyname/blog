title: "Watch out for this domain name certificate scam"

<!-- excerpt -->

From ICANN, in an article titled ["Fraudulent ICANN Domain Name Certificates"](https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2014-07-15-en):

> It has been brought to ICANN's attention that some online entities have attempted to sell fraudulent "certificates", which they claim are required to protect generic top-level domain names. The perpetuators of this scam threaten registrants on the protection service with the objective of securing a fee from the registrant. The "certificates" look official and include an unauthorized use of the ICANN logo.
