As a native-English speaker, the internet is as easily navigable for me as going to the supermarket. Just go to my English-language browser and type in a domain with a native-character extension like .COM or .NET.

But the planet is large, and most of us weren't born into English-speaking households. The alphabet I look at every day doesn't even use the same characters as Cyrillic or Arabic. So how could a native Japanese speaker feel welcome on the web when domain extensions are limited to Latin characters?

Well, with the rollout of the new generic Top-Level Domains, it's all changing. A number of new TLDs are set to be available soon, including [.شبكة](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%A9), [.中文网](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91) and [.Онлайн](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD). And just this week, [Google announced](http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/01/is-now-available-for-everyone.html?m=1) that [.みんな](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-みんな), the first TLD in [hiragana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana), will be open for general availability on February 21st.

This video from Google really sums up the sentiment:

Girl in video: (Referring to the new native domains) Wow! They all seem so nice and easy to understand! Okay, I've decided! I'm moving here too!

And why wouldn't everyone? It's such a practical idea for the TLDs to be native to everyone, and now it's finally starting to happen.
