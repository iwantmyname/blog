				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mailchimp.com/resources/guides/how-to-avoid-spam-filters/html/&#34;&gt;MailChimp on how spam filters work:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spam filters consider a long list of criteria when judging the “spamminess” of an email. They’ll weigh each factor and add them up to determine a spam score, which then determines whether a campaign will pass through the filter. They might look for spammy phrases like “CLICK HERE!” or “FREE! BUY NOW!” Then they&amp;rsquo;ll assign points every time they see one of those phrases. Certain criteria get more points than others. Here’s a sample of criteria from SpamAssassin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talks about lots of money (.193 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describes some sort of breakthrough (.232 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks like mortgage pitch (.297 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains urgent matter (.288 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money back guarantee (2.051 points)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your campaign’s total “spam score” exceeds a certain threshold, then your email goes to the junk folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>1API Abuse Domain Suspension Scam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we have been made aware of fraudulent emails that have been sent to a number of high profile domain registrars&amp;rsquo; customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These emails appear to be coming from abuse@1api.net or similar email addresses and attempt to impersonate the Spam and Abuse Department of our in-house domain name registrar 1API GmbH. These suspension emails are NOT being sent from Hexonet, 1API, or iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fraudulent emails claim your domain name has been suspended because you have failed to respond to previous email and telephone notices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email message is an attempt to have you click on links and download files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO NOT reply to the email directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO NOT click on any links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO NOT call the number listed in the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just delete and ignore the email. If you have any questions or concerns, whether you have received the email or not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a copy of one of the emails:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tiny domain names for tiny brains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.usc.edu/79313/study-reveals-internet-like-networks-in-cerebral-cortex-of-rats/&#34;&gt;Robert Perkins on the discovery that rat brains are set up like the internet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers sketching out a wiring diagram for rat brains — a field known as “connectomics” — have discovered that its structure is organized like the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen — the brain’s lobes, grooves and folds. Now, with a more comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another, they’ve discovered local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a Russian nesting doll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cerebral cortex is like a mini-Internet,” said Larry Swanson, professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. “The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. The brain operates in a similar way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new and exciting domain name market!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2G Tuesdays</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-2g-tuesdays-to-slow-employee-internet-speeds-down-2015-10?op=1&#34;&gt;Jillian D&amp;rsquo;Onfro on Facebook handling its &amp;ldquo;empathy gap&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is launching a new initiative called &amp;ldquo;2G Tuesdays&amp;rdquo; that will give all employees an opportunity to see what using the app with an incredibly slow connection feels like and help close the &amp;ldquo;empathy gap&amp;rdquo; between Silicon Valley and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most people, the stark differences will likely be jarring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to dream up interfaces that take advantage of blinding connection speeds, but businesses trying to reach global audiences need to do a much better job serving the other end of the spectrum. Even here at iwantmyname, our site is relatively minimal, but searching for a domain with a less-than-optimal connection can be grueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with responsive interfaces and top-shelf security, speed should be a main priority when building on the web. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sitepoint.com/average-page-weight-increases-15-2014/&#34;&gt;Your 2Mb page weight&lt;/a&gt; just isn&amp;rsquo;t working for a lot of people.)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting the internet to the underdeveloped world without drones or high-altitude balloons</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html&#34;&gt;Kris De Decker on how to build a low-tech internet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half of the global population does not have access to the &amp;ldquo;worldwide&amp;rdquo; web. Up to now, the internet is mainly an urban phenomenon, especially in &amp;ldquo;developing&amp;rdquo; countries. Telecommunication companies are usually reluctant to extend their network outside cities due to a combination of high infrastructure costs, low population density, limited ability to pay for services, and an unreliable or non-existent electricity infrastructure. Even in remote regions of &amp;ldquo;developed&amp;rdquo; countries, internet connectivity isn&amp;rsquo;t always available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet companies such as Facebook and Google regularly make headlines with plans for connecting these remote regions to the internet. Facebook tries to achieve this with drones, while Google counts on high-altitude balloons. There are major technological challenges, but the main objection to these plans is their commercial character. Obviously, Google and Facebook want to connect more people to the internet because that would increase their revenues. Facebook especially receives lots of criticism because their network promotes their own site in particular, and blocks most other internet applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, several research groups and network enthusiasts have developed and implemented much cheaper alternative network technologies to solve these issues. Although these low-tech networks have proven their worth, they have received much less attention. Contrary to the projects of internet companies, they are set up by small organisations or by the users themselves. This guarantees an open network that benefits the users instead of a handful of corporations. At the same time, these low-tech networks are very energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>The machines have taken over (your search results)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-26/google-turning-its-lucrative-web-search-over-to-ai-machines&#34;&gt;Jack Clark on Google using AI to figure out its search results:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, a “very large fraction” of the millions of queries a second that people type into the company’s search engine have been interpreted by an artificial intelligence system, nicknamed RankBrain, said Greg Corrado, a senior research scientist with the company, outlining for the first time the emerging role of AI in search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RankBrain uses artificial intelligence to embed vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities -- called vectors -- that the computer can understand. If RankBrain sees a word or phrase it isn’t familiar with, the machine can make a guess as to what words or phrases might have a similar meaning and filter the result accordingly, making it more effective at handling never-before-seen search queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day I spent a lot of time thinking about SEO. I poured over SEO blogs, asked for advice on how I can improve my search results, and did everything in my power to game the (people-powered) Google system. But it&amp;rsquo;s 2015. The computers are taking over. All that matters now is making sites that perform their intended task with the least resistance possible.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What if you don&#39;t talkie very clearly?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/talk.html&#34;&gt;Paul Graham with some writing advice:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make written language worse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes. Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read. It&amp;rsquo;s also more formal and distant, which gives the reader&amp;rsquo;s attention permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that you&amp;rsquo;re saying more than you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite is when arguments start in comment sections. They all start with similar troll statements followed by simple insults. But then they inevitably expand into a series of people trying to prove points with dissertation-style sentences that mean nothing. So many syllables, so little thought.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Every TLD has a story</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://priceonomics.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-ly/&#34;&gt;Rosie Cima on the rise and fall of .LY:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2011, civil war broke out in Libya. One of the main registrars of .ly addresses, Libyan Spider, was shut down, apparently as part of UN/US sanctions on Libya. For a time, the owners of Libyan Spider were only able to revive these urls by leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start-up Letter.ly also announced that it had gone down because it had let its domain registration expire, and it could not establish contact with the registrar to renew it’s contract. “Sorry for the hassle,” they wrote in an email to their users. “it’s amazing that a physical war has affected our service in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>An educated guess as to why domain name growth has been stalling</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150716_where_has_the_domain_name_growth_gone/&#34;&gt;Jay Dailey, Chief Executive of the .nz registry, on slowing domain name growth:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of new gTLDs has been to solve the &amp;lsquo;meaningfulness problem&amp;rsquo; by the creation of hundreds of new gTLDs and this in turn directly affects the perception of scarcity. This reduction in scarcity is in turn reducing the incentive to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my assertion that this speculative behaviour has been a significant factor in historical growth and so domain name growth prospects are partly dependent on what happens to that behaviour. At the macro level, global speculative behaviour in domain names will reduce and the money will switch to a different scarce asset, permanently leaving our industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future people will need domain names to create things on the internet, so registrars will be fine (although the days of bananas growth might be over). But the owners of these new gTLDs are probably sweating a bit. Their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geek.com/news/gtlds-whats-the-process-and-how-much-pay-icann-1392947/&#34;&gt;$185,000 investments&lt;/a&gt; might take much longer than expected to return a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Too much choice might be a bad thing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/21/choice-stressing-us-out-dating-partners-monopolies&#34;&gt;Stuart Jeffries on the stress that choice induces:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in Springfield, the Simpson family visited a new supermarket. Monstromart’s slogan was “where shopping is a baffling ordeal”. Product choice was unlimited, shelving reached the ceiling, nutmeg came in 12lb boxes and the express checkout had a sign reading, “1,000 items or less”. In the end the Simpsons returned to Apu’s Kwik-E-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, the Simpsons were making a choice to reduce their choice. It wasn’t quite a rational choice, but it made sense. In the parlance of economic theory, they were not rational utility maximisers but, in Herbert Simon’s term, “satisficers” – opting for what was good enough, rather than becoming confused to the point of inertia in front of Monstromart’s ranges of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be interesting to see how the domain industry, as a whole, is faring with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;500+ (and counting) new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; on the shelves. (Sometimes I think we should just pick the top 25 and say, &amp;ldquo;This is what we&amp;rsquo;re selling because these are the good ones!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
