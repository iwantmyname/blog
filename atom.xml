				<title>The guide to adding Squarespace to your iwantmyname domain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing, all-in-one site builder that makes top-end web design accessible to everyone. Seriously, with no skill going in, you&amp;#39;ll be able to build sites, stores, photo galleries, and blogs in minutes. It&amp;#39;s that intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s not quite as intuitive though is the domain setup. We pride ourselves in providing one-click installs to a ton of platforms, but sometimes there&amp;#39;s an extra step involved that can turn that one click into a bunch of clicks. Have no fear though, with this short guide, you&amp;#39;ll have your domain working with your Squarespace site in no time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get started with Squarespace by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace homepage&lt;/a&gt;, choosing a template, then clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Start With This Design&lt;/strong&gt; button. There are a couple quick questions you can answer after that, or you can skip them for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-home.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace home&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Squarespace&amp;#39;s side navigation, click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Domains&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Connect a Third-Party Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter your domain name in the Domain Name field provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-domain-iwantmyblog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Add domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/strong&gt; from the Domain Provider dropdown list. Click &lt;strong&gt;Connect Domain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-select-iwantmyname.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dropdown iwantmyname&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is now linking your domain. Click &lt;strong&gt;okay&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-in-progress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Click okay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy that long string of letters and numbers listed first under the Host column (it&amp;#39;ll look somehting like: abcde1fg2h3ijk4lmn5o). This is the verification code you&amp;#39;ll add in the iwantmyname dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-host.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Copy string&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a new window and log into your iwantmyname account, then head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/setup/Squarespace/&quot;&gt;Squarespace app setup page&lt;/a&gt;. Click Add Squarespace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve already signed up for squarespace, so now add the verification code to the &amp;#39;Unique verification code&amp;#39; input. Then click &lt;strong&gt;Install Squarespace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-unique-ver.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unique Code&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back on your Squarespace window, if you click &lt;strong&gt;Refresh&lt;/strong&gt;, everything should now say Correct. Sometimes it takes a bit (up to a few hours) for these things to work through the internet though, so don&amp;#39;t be alarmed if things don&amp;#39;t look correct right away. Just jump to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-correct.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Correct&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re all done! Have fun building your Squarespace site!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Taking stock of our 2015 community involvement</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being involved in the local community is vastly important to us, so this year we made a conscious decision to support more events that at least some of the iwantmyname team could actively participate in. Since we are already one-third of the way through 2015, I think it&amp;#39;s about time to take stock of what has been achieved so far and look at where we plan to go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekends loom large in our consciousness, and this year has been no exception. Organisers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupweekend.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekends here in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have a busy schedule planned, and we&amp;#39;ve already been lucky enough to sponsor and participate in the recent Wellington event. Lenz and I put on our mentor hats, Kevin Ingersoll participated in a team, and Coco the domain dog lent moral support by snoozing blissfully throughout. So imagine our excitement when the judges announced that Kevin&amp;#39;s team had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmynameNZ/status/587195037274005504&quot;&gt;scored a well-earned win&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrills of Startup Weekend were soon followed by intellectual debate and thorough workshopping of the open source paradigm at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourceopensociety.com/&quot;&gt;Open Source Open Society conference&lt;/a&gt;, held in conjunction with Github and Enspiral. We employ open source technologies and open thinking &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html&quot;&gt;throughout our business&lt;/a&gt;, so it seemed like the perfect event for us to be a part of. There was also a cool closing party with a funky, indie DJ on tap, so nobody wanted to leave—but that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also remain keen backers of the PHP Meetup and JavaScript Meetup in our city, and have been helping out with the R9 initiative, an experimental incubator aiming to solve important business problems in the government sector by using lean methodologies. Many of these events have our local tech business incubator &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativehq.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Creative HQ&lt;/a&gt; at their heart, so we&amp;#39;re more than thrilled to be announcing a strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this week on, we will be shouting the beers at the highly popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/StartupGarage/&quot;&gt;Startup Garage&lt;/a&gt; Meetup. Each month, Creative HQ hosts an interesting speaker from the start-up world, many of whom bring wisdom from afar. Recent appearances have included SXSW organiser Shawn O&amp;#39;Keefe and President of Y Combinator, Sam Altman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 is shaping up to be a big year for community involvement here at iwantmyname, and we&amp;#39;re excited to make further inroads in the local start-up ecosystem. If you see us around, come say hi! We&amp;#39;d love to chat. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making customer support sustainable with a small team based on a tiny island</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what service you offer or product you sell, a good chunk of any business is customer support. But unlike many other aspects of running a business, how companies handle customer support can vary widely, even among companies in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our little corner of the Internet, the domain industry, we have a couple of unique challenges. First, domain registration is a comparatively low margin business, so to keep our business afloat, we rely on the support of a lot of customers. Tens of thousands, with 150,000+ domains under management. And no matter how stable your platform, when you&amp;#39;re dealing with that many moving parts, any flaw, bug, or confusing process will be uncovered very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is the clock. Most of the iwantmyname team is in New Zealand, but what happens when it&amp;#39;s 10pm, and someone has an issue in London, where it&amp;#39;s only 11am? Is it acceptable to pass on the expectation that people need sleep? It&amp;#39;s an honest question, and a concern for many small companies that can&amp;#39;t afford to have 24-hour call centers or offices all around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is an instant answer world without any face-to-face dialogue, which strips a lot of the humanity out of the process. And we all fall into it—if my website breaks, I expect instant answers, but if my car breaks, I know I have to set an appointment during business hours. It&amp;#39;s all about setting expectations, and that&amp;#39;s one of the hardest things for businesses to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/j62Hmj6SMpJV6?html5=true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle the support load, companies can go a few different directions. As I stated before, they can stock up a support team or outsource all the support to a third party, but that&amp;#39;s expensive, impersonal, and honestly, a little underwhelming in the experience department. Sure, there are a lot of quick Q&amp;amp;A type issues that can be handled quickly by anyone with basic knowledge of the domain industry, but if you have a real problem, you want real solutions. Nothing is more aggravating than dealing with a support layer that clearly won&amp;#39;t be able to solve your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue with stocking up a support team is our rather unique salary structure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;ve written about it before&lt;/a&gt;, but our philosophy from the start has been to pay everyone on the team a flat wage. On the customer side, it may be frustrating to not see us hire 20 low-wage support specialists, but we strongly believe in companies providing livable wages to their employees. As Lenz, one of our co-founders, has said in the past, the wellbeing of the team is just as important as the well-being of the company. People are important, and as they grow, the company grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after years of dual roles and unsustainable hours, it was clear that a distributed support team was a must. We needed a better way to support the Americas on Fridays (which are Saturdays in NZ), and we needed a way to cover the middle of the world during normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we hired Melle (last year), who in eastern Canada could take on American business hours—and what a difference it made. With her in Canada and the rest of the dual-role supporters in NZ, we could roughly cover 17 hours of the day, Tuesday-Friday, with people working a typical 8am-5pm day, then nine hours on NZ Mondays and Saturdays (Fridays in Canada). But still, if someone had an issue in London on Monday at 9am, it would be in the wee early morning for Melle, and well past dinner for the New Zealanders. Life was certainly better, but there were still support gaps—and our brave co-founder Paul was still sometimes working seven days a week to make sure the support load never got out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth is a tricky thing with a small, bootstrapped team, but our trajectory for 2015 and beyond led us to two very important decisions. To create the best possible experience for our customers, we&amp;#39;d need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a UI designer to help build a solid interface (which, through organization and clear instructions, will hopefully cut down our future support load quite a bit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a second supporter in Europe to cover our gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Kevin, who was hired a few months back, has been hard at work on new interface ideas. And our newest iwantmynamer, Steffi, is working through support cases from her house in Germany (and she&amp;#39;s quite awesome at it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, with three support &amp;quot;teams&amp;quot; scattered around the planet, we&amp;#39;re roughly covering 23 hours of the day, Tuesday-Friday, then 15 hours on Saturday, all without stretching any of our work schedules beyond a reasonable amount. New Zealand Sundays are still a hole for us, so we typically only cover urgent cases then, but as long as we set the right expectations, our email-based support system is perfect for getting everything worked out in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often get asked why we don&amp;#39;t offer a phone service or an instant-on online chat, and the answer is simple—instant communication is inefficient, and often leads to answers that aren&amp;#39;t fully thought out or articulated well. Quite a few things have to happen to answer a support question successfully. We have to get the problem, understand the problem, find the problem, take the steps to fix it, and then break down an easily actionable solution. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s as easy as sending a link, but other times issues need to be handled by multiple people in multiple places (registries, platforms, etc.), which aren&amp;#39;t always under our control. And that takes time—especially when there are questions in the queue coming in from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;email-only support&lt;/a&gt;, we can get to each question as fast as humanly possible without wasting our customers&amp;#39; valuable time sitting on hold or finding their way through strange automated systems. And with our support answers all in written form, we can easily build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;knowledge base&lt;/a&gt; full of quick answers to common questions. It&amp;#39;s been working well for us so far (&lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;96% love it!&lt;/a&gt;), and hopefully it&amp;#39;ll only get better as our interface becomes easier and easier to use and navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Everything you need to know about domain hacks</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-domain-dot-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;domain dot hack&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of domain registration (the dark times before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; were launched), there was a point where it was quite hard to find a domain that was both short and memorable. Many of the good &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; domain names were taken, as were the more common words and phrases in various country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.CO.UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt;. So what do people commonly do when there&amp;#39;s a shortage of something that&amp;#39;s in demand? They get creative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a domain hack is to take a word or brand, like iwantmyname, and use the domain extension as part of the word. So instead of iwantmyname.com, a domain hacker would go with iwantmyna.me (using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; TLD) or iwantmy.name (using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt; TLD). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are domain hacks useful?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-street-art.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;street art&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is street art useful? Not really, but it sure is fun to look at. With a domain hack, you can create a domain name that&amp;#39;s uniquely yours—one that may align with your whimsical brand mentality better than a .COM ever could. If the last few letters in your name happen to be a ccTLD, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&quot;&gt;.IS&lt;/a&gt; in Chris, then you have yourself a good domain hack (chr.is). If the last few letters in your brand happen to be a new gTLD, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&quot;&gt;.PRESS&lt;/a&gt; in Express, then you have yourself another (ex.press). Or if you just want to make something up, like beeris.gd... you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we like domain hacks though, there are some downsides you should be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a domain hack for your primary domain might not be a good idea (we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1418597-how-do-i-set-up-forwarding-with-my-domain-&quot;&gt;forwarding&lt;/a&gt; domain hacks to a primary domain). With more and more people using search engines and social media to browse the web this is less of an issue, but if you go with anything other than .COM or your local ccTLD, you&amp;#39;re bound to get people typing in the wrong thing. For instance, if our primary domain was iwantmyna.me, I&amp;#39;d guess that at least half (probably more) would reflexively type in iwantmyname.com. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain hacks are hard to say out loud. Again, as more and more people navigate with search engines and social it&amp;#39;s less of a big deal, but if you&amp;#39;re in an interview or meeting and have to say your domain name, you don&amp;#39;t want to sound like you&amp;#39;re stumbling over yourself. Just try to say chr.is out loud. &amp;quot;c-h-r-dot-i-s.&amp;quot; Or possibly &amp;quot;chris, but with the dot before the i-s.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s much easier to say &amp;quot;chris.com.&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about domain hacks for URL shortening?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-short-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Short link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Twitter was first created, links were a real problem. Just picture it—you have 140 characters to complete a thought, and links can be quite long. If you wanted to send a link to our .COM page (iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial), you&amp;#39;re looking at a hefty 67 characters. To get around that link bloat, a bunch of companies created shortening solutions which linked desired (long) URL&amp;#39;s to a short URL, like bit.ly/XXXXXX or ow.ly/XXXXXX (the XXXXXX being a randomly generated, unique string of characters). Then, using custom domain names, you could brand your short URL&amp;#39;s using your own custom domain name, so instead of bit.ly/XXXXXX, tweets would show something like iwmn.me/XXXXXX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Twitter wraps everything in their t.co URL shortener (which uses the original URL&amp;#39;s metadata to show a truncated version of the original URL), but companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&quot;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; are still proving useful by giving users valuable link analytics for their tweets (or other social posts). If you have a data-driven approach to social media, link shortening platforms are still quite useful. But they certainly aren&amp;#39;t the must-have tools they used to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are there any tools for finding domain hacks?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-domain-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;iwantmyname search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not specifically looking for one, domain hacks can be tricky to think up. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyname domain search&lt;/a&gt; has a basic domain hack finder built in. Just type any word in, and the second result (if applicable) will be a domain hack using one of our many domain extensions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a bit more though, try doing a search over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainr.com&quot;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt;. Doing the same search I did above (whatismydomainname), they pulled out some crazy stuff like whatismydomainn.am/e, whatismydoma.in.na/me, and whatismydomain.na/me. Pretty fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Registering .au domains without the .com part may soon become reality</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/18367-australia-considers-dumping-the-com&quot;&gt;DomainIncite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian domain overseer auDA is thinking about allowing people to register .au domains directly at the second level for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization has opened up a consultation that would allow registrations such as example.au, rather than just the current system of example.com.au, example.org.au and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move follows the successful recent releases of 2LDs in the UK (.uk) and New Zealand (.nz) ccTLDs and can be seen as a bid to remain competitive in the face of the new gTLD program’s huge expansion of TLD choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s good news for Australian domain owners! Let’s just hope this also results in making it easier to obtain domains and not have people jump through hoops as with the current registration policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, .com.au currently requires you to provide a company ID such as and Australian Business Number when purchasing a domain name which makes it difficult for somebody just starting out. And individuals are not allowed to register .com.au at all but need to go with .id.au instead. However, domains under .id.au must either match your real name or be closely connected to you and might be declined if not. Talk about making it complicated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, Australians might as well consider other alternatives for their online identity like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (or the recently mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/04/reach-an-international-audience-with-these-country-code-top-level-domains.html&quot;&gt;gccTLDs&lt;/a&gt;) which you can specifically target at local visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reach an international audience with these 19 country code top-level domains</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the process of starting a new website and want to go with a shorter country domain extension rather than any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (or .COM), there&amp;#39;s one thing you should know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google treats some ccTLDs (such as .tv, .me, etc.) as gTLDs, as we’ve found that users and webmasters frequently see these more generic than country-targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1347922?hl=en&quot;&gt;set a geographic target through Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. use a .co domain and be listed in search results in the United States, Canada or France although it is actually Colombia’s top-level domain. The same is true if you don’t want to target a specific country, i.e. have a .me domain for your personal online profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But which ones of these so-called gccTLDs (generic country code top-level domains) are the most popular and more likely to be recognized by visitors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at Verisign’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/domain-name-report-march2015.pdf&quot;&gt;latest domain industry brief&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-21-gcctld-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;verisign graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ccTLDs, including .tk, .co, .me and .tv are frequently used by registrants and treated by search engines as gTLDs. This chart ranks the zone size of both gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs, as of Dec. 31, 2014, with that classification taken into account. The top 10 largest gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs by zone size were .com, .tk, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .co, .mobi, .me and .tv, as of Dec. 31, 2014, which account for 180.6 million domain name registrations, or 62.8 percent of the total global domain name registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau&quot;&gt;.tk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.co&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.me&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.tv&lt;/a&gt; as the most popular gccTLDs in that list. Not surprising, except .tk which offers free domains—but with certain usage restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other popular ones you may have seen are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io&lt;/a&gt; for tech sites (which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/&quot;&gt;still on the rise&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.fm&lt;/a&gt; for music websites, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands&quot;&gt;.cc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa&quot;&gt;.ws&lt;/a&gt; for general use, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nu-domain-name-registration-for-niue&quot;&gt;.nu&lt;/a&gt; (popular in Scandinavian countries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesser known gccTLDs, but often registered for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; because they don’t require any special documentation or local address in the country, are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&quot;&gt;.la&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.ms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.sc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/as-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-american-samoa&quot;&gt;.as&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize&quot;&gt;.bz&lt;/a&gt; suffixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the remaining geo-targetable domain extensions from Google’s list: .ad, .cd, .dj, .sr, and .su. Unfortunately, we don&amp;#39;t carry these domains because they&amp;#39;re not easy to purchase and maintain, so you&amp;#39;d have to choose another registrar (our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainr.com&quot;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help with that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the overall result if we were to rank the ccTLD&amp;#39;s by international popularity, user recognition, and how easy they are to obtain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best: .co, .me, .tv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good: .io, .fm, .ws, .nu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe: .la, .ms, .sc, .as, .bz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average: .ad, .cd, .dj, .sr, .su&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it also depends on the type of website you are launching, but for businesses you should probably stick to the “best” and “good” categories.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Contacting the owner of a domain you want to buy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-20-passing-domain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passing domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published a fairly extensive series a while back to help you figure out what to do if there&amp;#39;s a domain you want that&amp;#39;s already been registered, or similar issues. Two of the most relevant posts for our purposes here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt5.html&quot;&gt;Part 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt6.html&quot;&gt;Part 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t go into a lot of detail about exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to contact the current owner of a domain that you&amp;#39;re interested in acquiring though. Or what to do if you do manage to get in touch and make an offer. We&amp;#39;ll start with the easy way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Contacting a registrant - WHOIS lookup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to your favorite &lt;a href=&quot;http://whois.domaintools.com/&quot;&gt;WHOIS lookup site&lt;/a&gt;, you can enter the domain and get the publicly available details of who owns the domain. Be aware that not all WHOIS lookups are official and present accurate information. Also be aware that sometimes registries (like for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nic.io/&quot;&gt;ccTLDs such as .IO&lt;/a&gt;) have their own WHOIS lookups, which may provide different or additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you want the registrant contact email address, as the registrant is the domain&amp;#39;s legal owner. gTLDs have four registrant contacts: registrant/owner, admin, technical, and billing. These can all be the same person/organization, or four different ones. Some ccTLDs, like .UK, only have two contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Registrant email address considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, just finding an email address for the registrant doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee contact. Particularly if someone has owned a domain for a long time, they may not use the email address anymore that they provided for registration. Lots of things can change: leaving school, getting hacked, and changing addresses, or simply upgrading the email hosting you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, many email clients have stringent spam filtering, and emails from addresses that they&amp;#39;ve never received email from before may not be allowed through automatically. There are lots of articles out there outlining other spam filter triggers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mailchimp.com/most-common-spam-filter-triggers/&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good example.&lt;/a&gt; These are good things to be aware of for how you craft your email to the owner of the domain you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people also use WHOIS privacy services, either provided by their registrar (&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425&quot;&gt;more information about ours&lt;/a&gt;) or by a third-party service. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s obvious when one of these services is in place. For example, for customers using our new WHOIS privacy service, information for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whoistrustee.com/&quot;&gt;WhoisTrustee&lt;/a&gt; will be shown instead of a person or organization&amp;#39;s contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be email addresses shown for the contacts when a WHOIS privacy service is in place, but there&amp;#39;s a chance that the registrant cannot receive email sent to them. (For example, if the underlying email address is outdated or the forwarding filters out certain messages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Registrant is unreachable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever the reason, it is quite possible the registrant&amp;#39;s contact information is not available for the domain you want. Obviously, this presents a problem. Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a solveable one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time people who can&amp;#39;t get contact information for a domain they want contact us to ask us for that information, or to ask us to contact the domain owner for them. We can&amp;#39;t speak for other registrars, but our policy is not to do this. We take customers&amp;#39; privacy very seriously. Additionally, we are not in the brokerage business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that unless the domain is allowed to expire and is released, you may have no way of acquiring it. In these cases we recommend having some viable alternatives. And make sure you&amp;#39;ve secured a domain name &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; printing signs, business cards, etc. (You&amp;#39;d be surprised how often people don&amp;#39;t do this...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Domain brokerage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in having a third party try to contact a domain&amp;#39;s owner for you, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sedo.com/us/buy-domains/domain-brokerage/&quot;&gt;Sedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainagents.com/&quot;&gt;DomainAgents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brokerage services will do is contact the domain owner (if they can), then make an offer for the domain for you, handle negotiations, and finalize the agreement to purchase and transfer the domain. In addition to whatever price you pay for the domain, you will also pay a fee to the broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You&amp;#39;ve contacted the domain owner... now what?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s up to you, really. First, you need to see if the person is interested in parting with the domain. It&amp;#39;s a good idea, when you&amp;#39;re looking up the WHOIS details, to check the date on which the domain was registered. If someone has had the domain for a decade, there may be pretty good odds that they&amp;#39;re not interested in getting rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;#39;s possible the person registered the domain hoping to sell it, but the right buyer just hadn&amp;#39;t come along until you did. And, as we&amp;#39;ve previously mentioned, just because there is no website up for the domain doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not in use or not wanted. There are a lot of ways to use domains that don&amp;#39;t involve publicly accessible websites. (And even if the domain isn&amp;#39;t being used for anything, no, we (&lt;em&gt;nor any other registrar&lt;/em&gt;) can&amp;#39;t just take it for you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you can do is contact the owner and hope they receive the message and reply. If they don&amp;#39;t reply, or they say no, there&amp;#39;s not much you can do. If they are interested, then you have a chance. And typically, if someone is interested in selling a domain, they&amp;#39;ll make it quite easy to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to know beforehand how much you&amp;#39;re willing to spend on the domain. Some domains are quite reasonable, others very, very expensive. Essentially, the domain is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Even if the owner says they&amp;#39;re willing to sell, if they want a million dollars and you don&amp;#39;t have or aren&amp;#39;t willing to pay that, then the domain might as well not be for sale at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, sounding too interested (read: desperate) can make the asking price go up steeply and quickly. And there&amp;#39;s really nothing you can do about it, except walk away. So, again, having a budget and an alternative plan is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#39;ve come to an agreement... now what?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&amp;#39;ve managed to contact the domain owner, they were interested in selling, and now you&amp;#39;ve made a deal. How do you actually get the domain? Well, it depends. For gTLDs (e.g. .COM) the transfer process is standardized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1336688&quot;&gt;There&amp;#39;s information on the requirements here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ccTLDs there can be a lot of variance in what&amp;#39;s required to transfer, so if you have trouble figuring it out or getting started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the domain owner is an iwantmyname customer and so are you, you can do what&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184478&quot;&gt;an internal transfer or move.&lt;/a&gt;. (Provided the domain is old enough, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to transfer the domain from the owner&amp;#39;s account at another registrar to your account with iwantmyname, then the owner would unlock the domain, get the transfer auth code, remove any privacy services, and one of you (whomever has the auth code) would initiate the transfer at our website. (That is for gTLDs. As noted, the process may differ somewhat for ccTLDs.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184465&quot;&gt;More information on transferring TO iwantmyname here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the owner is an iwantmyname customer and you want to transfer the domain to your account at another registrar, then the owner would unlock the domain, get the transfer auth code, remove any privacy services, and one of you (whomever has the auth code) would initiate the transfer at the new registrar&amp;#39;s website. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184477&quot;&gt;More information on transferring FROM iwantmyname here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the domain type and registrars involved, transfers can be immediate, or take up to 5 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, be sure that all payments and other arrangements have been made &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; initiating the transfer. Once a domain has been transferred, it&amp;#39;s likely no longer yours or accessible, and you have no way of getting it back or withholding it to demand payment if you get shafted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be the legal owner of a domain, your name and/or organization&amp;#39;s name needs to be in the registrant/owner contact details. This information may not automatically change when a domain is transferred. Be sure to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, you can update the registrant contacts for many types of domains in your dashboard, under &lt;em&gt;edit contacts&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re unable to do that, there may be an issue, or we may need to make the update for you, so let us know. If your domain is registered elsewhere, you&amp;#39;ll need to contact that registrar for help updating the details if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that changing the registrant contact details is often called an &lt;em&gt;owner change&lt;/em&gt;. For some types of domains, this change is considered by registries to be similar to a domain registration, so there may be a fee involved. Some registries also require identification and paperwork to be included. (We can help clarify this as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of millions of domains registered, there is a pretty good chance that one you want is taken already. If it&amp;#39;s one you really want, you may be fortunate and able to procure it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, nowadays at least there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;hundreds of new TLDs&lt;/a&gt; to choose from to help you come up with just the right alternative. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using the iwantmyname Marketplace to find your next blog, personal site, portfolio, or e-commerce platform</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it useful? If so, how can we make it even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions we&amp;#39;ve been asking a lot of ourselves lately, and they represent what I think is the goal of this vast world we call the internet. Just think of the progression from the pre-internet world to now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1970&amp;#39;s - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a record to play at home. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1990&amp;#39;s - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a CD to play in your car. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000&amp;#39;s - You read an album review online (quite useful), then download the album to listen on any of your devices (still a chore).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The future - The album you want and all the content around it are integrated. There are no barriers. Listen, discover, and share, instantly. I can&amp;#39;t think of anything more useful than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the goal of the internet. Reduce the noise, reduce the work—all so you can instantly get what you want, right when you want it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting at iwantmyname, I used iwantmyname for one very specific reason. They had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;big collection of platforms&lt;/a&gt; available for me to plug-in to without having to find any DNS instructions. When I think of an idea, the last thing I want to do is figure out how to get the thing I want to use up and running. With iwantmyname, I could start sites on platforms like Squarespace, Virb, and Tumblr in a snap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I only subconsciously realized was how much clutter I&amp;#39;d removed from my life. Instead of reading review after review of every new CMS under the sun, I had a place to go that had some cultivation going on. A place where I could quickly check out some of the coolest platforms on the web, and then add them to my domain with just a few clicks. iwantmyname bridged that gap from discovery to creation, and it saved me time. So much time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-16-iwmn-marketplace.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and we have so many hosted platforms to discover in the iwantmyname &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll find big ones like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the platforms that tend to fly under the radar (but are still mighty useful) for non-developers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Without needing to login or buy anything, you can browse through 100+ platforms, and when you&amp;#39;re ready, you can grab a domain and start creating content in a flash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easily one of the fastest ways to go from platform discovery to site creation on the web while still giving you the flexibility to change platforms in the future and add other useful things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/&quot;&gt;custom forums&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The future of the Marketplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we come back to our original question. How can we make our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; more useful than it is today? A couple weeks ago, the whole team met in Wellington to plan out the future of the site. Plenty of things were discussed, but one of our main focuses was the Marketplace—particularly, what we can do in the future to make it more useful. And the solution (well, at least one of the solutions) was content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vigorously remove any content doesn&amp;#39;t help people get from point A to point B faster, and put a much larger content focus on the platforms we plug-in to than our own. We already have the tools in place to get you going on a platform, and we already have a large (and growing) selection of platforms available. What we&amp;#39;re missing is the added content needed to remove the initial research barrier. Not editorial, but useful content that breaks down what each platform does, and how their featuresets can uniquely work to bring what&amp;#39;s in your head to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-16-future-marketplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Future Marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future Marketplace, you should be able to have a solid idea of what a platform does without having to go searching elsewhere, and hopefully that extra level of information will translate to real time saved. And that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re after. Saving you time so you can get back to building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about our plans though. Is there anything you&amp;#39;d like to see in the Marketplace to make it more useful? If so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;drop us a message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
