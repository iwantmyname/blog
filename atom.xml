				<title>Using the iwantmyname Marketplace to find your next blog, personal site, portfolio, or e-commerce platform</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it useful? If so, how can we make it even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions we&amp;#39;ve been asking a lot of ourselves lately, and they represent what I think is the goal of this vast world we call the internet. Just think of the progression from the pre-internet world to now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1970&amp;#39;s - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a record to play at home. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1990&amp;#39;s - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a CD to play in your car. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000&amp;#39;s - You read an album review online (quite useful), then download the album to listen on any of your devices (still a chore).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The future - The album you want and all the content around it are integrated. There are no barriers. Listen, discover, and share, instantly. I can&amp;#39;t think of anything more useful than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the goal of the internet. Reduce the noise, reduce the work—all so you can instantly get what you want, right when you want it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting at iwantmyname, I used iwantmyname for one very specific reason. They had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;big collection of platforms&lt;/a&gt; available for me to plug-in to without having to find any DNS instructions. When I think of an idea, the last thing I want to do is figure out how to get the thing I want to use up and running. With iwantmyname, I could start sites on platforms like Squarespace, Virb, and Tumblr in a snap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I only subconsciously realized was how much clutter I&amp;#39;d removed from my life. Instead of reading review after review of every new CMS under the sun, I had a place to go that had some cultivation going on. A place where I could quickly check out some of the coolest platforms on the web, and then add them to my domain with just a few clicks. iwantmyname bridged that gap from discovery to creation, and it saved me time. So much time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-16-iwmn-marketplace.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and we have so many hosted platforms to discover in the iwantmyname &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll find big ones like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the platforms that tend to fly under the radar (but are still mighty useful) for non-developers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Without needing to login or buy anything, you can browse through 100+ platforms, and when you&amp;#39;re ready, you can grab a domain and start creating content in a flash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easily one of the fastest ways to go from platform discovery to site creation on the web while still giving you the flexibility to change platforms in the future and add other useful things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/&quot;&gt;custom forums&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The future of the Marketplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we come back to our original question. How can we make our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; more useful than it is today? A couple weeks ago, the whole team met in Wellington to plan out the future of the site. Plenty of things were discussed, but one of our main focuses was the Marketplace—particularly, what we can do in the future to make it more useful. And the solution (well, at least one of the solutions) was content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vigorously remove any content doesn&amp;#39;t help people get from point A to point B faster, and put a much larger content focus on the platforms we plug-in to than our own. We already have the tools in place to get you going on a platform, and we already have a large (and growing) selection of platforms available. What we&amp;#39;re missing is the added content needed to remove the initial research barrier. Not editorial, but useful content that breaks down what each platform does, and how their featuresets can uniquely work to bring what&amp;#39;s in your head to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-16-future-marketplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Future Marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future Marketplace, you should be able to have a solid idea of what a platform does without having to go searching elsewhere, and hopefully that extra level of information will translate to real time saved. And that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re after. Saving you time so you can get back to building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about our plans though. Is there anything you&amp;#39;d like to see in the Marketplace to make it more useful? If so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;drop us a message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The nearly foolproof three-step test for determining the quality of a website</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-15-twitter-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter Logos&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Find the social icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; If the Twitter icon isn&amp;#39;t shaped like the birds above (angled slightly up), you&amp;#39;ve probably found a brand that either doesn&amp;#39;t understand the internet or doesn&amp;#39;t care about details (possibly worse?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that there are levels of terribleness here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-15-twitter-logo-old.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old Twitter Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Score -100:&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely the wrong logo, but I can see how someone could see this and not instantly think it&amp;#39;s wrong. If you see something like this on a personal site, politely send an email to the site owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-15-twitter-logo-older.png&quot; alt=&quot;Older Twitter Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Score -4000:&lt;/strong&gt; You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant with carpet clearly from the 1980&amp;#39;s? &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Can non-devs be part of the open source community?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9307255&quot;&gt;From thomk - Hacker News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask HN: How do technical non-developers help with open source projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to code for a living but decided that I enjoy being a technical writer and PM much, much more. Things I enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing detailed functional specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating wireframes &amp;amp; mockups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating flowcharts, BPMN docs &amp;amp; graphs to explain a project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning Poker, Creating sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussing technical issues with developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplifying technical issues for customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning about new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining new technology to customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is; Is there a need for someone like me in any open source projects and if so, how do I contribute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lenz &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html&quot;&gt;recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;At iwantmyname, we not only use open-source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open source.&amp;quot; But as a non-developer, truly understanding what open source stands for is a hard thing to grasp. Writers, designers, and project managers can make educated guesses, but getting non-devs involved in the world of open source can only mean good things and more well-rounded ideas for the community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, questions like the Hacker News thread above are definitely a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Does open source contribute to a more open society?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies say they love open source, but what does that actually mean? Does it mean they use a lot of software other people have written? Does it mean they like that they don&amp;#39;t have to pay for things? Or do they understand that &lt;em&gt;loving open source&lt;/em&gt; also means contributing back to the community the code came from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start again. We at iwantmyname love open source! And when I say we love open source, I mean that we&amp;#39;re always trying to work and live up to its ethos—to continuously share the things we learn, and to approach challenges with facts instead of emotion. Open-source development is all about learning and developing in the open, with people we may never meet in real life—it doesn&amp;#39;t matter to any of us what we look like, who we are, what our gender is, our race, religious beliefs, or sexual preference. It&amp;#39;s all irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how we can work together to make projects awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having lived in this environment for many years, I&amp;#39;ve started to apply this same thinking to other parts of my life. With less time these days to contribute to actual code, I make efforts to talk at conferences and user groups, and, even more importantly, to grab coffee with people who ask for feedback (or are willing to give feedback) on ideas, architectures, and random happenings. The open source community I&amp;#39;m in has become a very real community, where the people I know can discuss, in the open, critical business-related things without fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why the trust? Well, open source also teaches ethics—to be able to work and share with a loose team of contributors. You need a level of trust to have someone you&amp;#39;ve never met in person contribute code to a project, and you need the right thought technology in place to create the expectation of not breaching that trust. If that trust is breached, projects get forked, communities split up, and egos clash until everyone gets back to the hard facts and finds new ways of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we not only use open source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open-source. We actively do this by working closely with local tech incubators, hosting like-minded user groups and meetups, and sponsoring innovative events like the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensourceopensociety.com&quot;&gt;OS//OS 2015&lt;/a&gt; conference here in Wellington, which is very much aligned with our core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s exciting to be part of a brand that makes such a large impact relative to our size, and I love that we&amp;#39;ve been given the opportunity to be so deeply embedded in what&amp;#39;s going on in New Zealand and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Last chance to get your short .NZ domain before anyone else</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Time is running out, but you still have until 30 March 2015 to either register or reserve the shorter version of your .NZ domain name before anyone else. As you may know, all ‘second level’ domains like the .CO in ‘.CO.NZ’ and the .NET in ‘.NET.NZ’ are now optional, meaning you can register .NZ names with them, without them, or both (you can read more about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/&quot;&gt;anyname.nz&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that registering or reserving your corresponding .NZ name is entirely optional and will not affect your existing domain. However, it is important to remember that anyone can register domains directly under .NZ after 30 March 2015. For example, if you own the domain myperfectwebsite.CO.NZ and you do not register or reserve myperfectwebsite.NZ, anybody can buy that domain after the pre period ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that little note, have a great weekend! And, as always, please let us know if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;have any questions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.green is your new favorite color</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpiIWMWWVco&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as colors go, green is a loaded word. It stands for sustainability, political movements, and money. Kermit the Frog feels green. Sick people look a little green. Green is everywhere, and now your favorite color has an online home—&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-green&quot;&gt;.green&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what should people do with it? Here are some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Political Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries have a green party, and adding .green to a name, country, or movement slogan could be a nice touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;country.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vote.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Investment Planners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be careful not to be too forward, but if you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;making green&amp;quot; for people and either have a sense of humor or are pretty blunt, .green could be a funny domain alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saving.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sustainability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability is a buzzword that&amp;#39;s here to stay, and &amp;quot;being green&amp;quot; is something more and more people around the world are striving for. So if you&amp;#39;re looking to create a sustainability blog or a green company, .green is a perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COMPANY.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tips.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re Kermit the Frog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;itsnoteasybeing.green &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Is Medium the billionaire’s typewriter?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html&quot;&gt;From Matthew Butterick, in an article titled, &amp;quot;The billionaire’s typewriter&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But un­like the Times, Medium pays for only a small fraction of its stories. The rest are sub­mit­ted—for free—by writ­ers like you. After a long time being elusive about its business model, Medium revealed that it plans to make money by—sur­prise!—sell­ing ad­ver­tis­ing. This means dis­play­ing ads, but also col­lect­ing and sell­ing data about read­ers and writ­ers. So Medium will extract rev­enue from every story, whether it paid for that story or not. (By the way, will that rev­enue be shared with writ­ers? Um, no.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And com­ing full cir­cle—what’s the in­dis­pens­able tool for cre­at­ing this il­lu­sion of an ed­i­to­r­ial ecosystem? The ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign. The but­ter­fly bal­lot of 2000 (de­picted in why ty­pog­ra­phy matters) proved that er­rors of ty­pog­ra­phy can have his­toric con­se­quences. Medium proves that typog­ra­phy can be used as a tool of eco­nomic lever­age and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, Medium’s main prod­uct is not a pub­lish­ing plat­form, but the pro­mo­tion of a pub­lish­ing platform. This pro­mo­tion brings read­ers and writ­ers onto the site. This, in turn, gen­er­ates the us­age data that’s valu­able to ad­ver­tis­ers. Boiled down, Medium is sim­ply mar­ket­ing in the ser­vice of more mar­ket­ing. It is not a “place for ideas.” It is a place for ad­ver­tis­ers. It is, there­fore, ut­terly superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a writer, the state of writing on the web in 2015 is not good. That&amp;#39;s not to say the tools for writing have dried up (there are more now than ever)—it&amp;#39;s just that now, instead of simply writing, I have all sorts of internal issues. Who owns my content? If I don&amp;#39;t own it, who does? Does it matter? Is &amp;quot;homogeneous design&amp;quot; something I even care about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m coming from. I have a job that pays the bills, so when I want to get some thoughts into the cloud, I&amp;#39;m not doing it for money, I&amp;#39;m doing it to be a citizen in the communities I care about. As Austin Kleon says in &lt;em&gt;Show Your Work!&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can leverage when they need it—for fellowship, feedback, or patronage.&amp;quot; For that goal, Medium, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, are perfect. Sure, everything you see on the page looks exactly the same—same typography, same basic structure—but it&amp;#39;s an instant way for a writer to connect to, and discover, the people they care about. It&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m lazy, or that I&amp;#39;m unknowingly trading my freedom to be on some Big Brother marketing platform (the billionaire&amp;#39;s typewriter), I&amp;#39;m just in a place in my life where I&amp;#39;m happy to share my thoughts on a platform someone else has created because they&amp;#39;ve removed all the barriers and invited all my friends. It&amp;#39;s a party I didn&amp;#39;t have to plan... I just had to show up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium, for example, has a CMS that anyone on the planet can use, and a design that certainly doesn&amp;#39;t insult my sensibilities. Call it minimalist, homogeneous, whatever—as a writer, I can get in, write something, and send it off to my friends without worrying if it looks good or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only issue with Medium is that its users are fairly anonymous. If I want to find a writer, I have to figure out what their Medium username is, then toss it to the back of the standard Medium URL. Too often, I&amp;#39;m just cycling through articles without ever knowing who the author is—it&amp;#39;s just a mad shuffle of big ideas and original thoughts from people I might not ever know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Medium needs is custom domains.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to be able to tell a friend to check out chrishall.pizza, not medium.com/@hashtaghall. I&amp;#39;m far too Gen X to want to be a blatant &amp;quot;corporate stooge,&amp;quot; but the Millennial in me just needs a little recognition to be appeased. Give me that level of individuality and I could care less if they leverage my writing to make some money. It wasn&amp;#39;t written to be a profit center anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the piece linked above, Matthew Butterick paints a solid picture of why someone like himself shouldn&amp;#39;t use Medium. He, like many, value things like site individuality and varied typography more than I do. And he may have a soapbox with Practical Typography that pays the bills and connects him to more people than I will probably ever know. But I don&amp;#39;t think many people want to blog full-time (it&amp;#39;s harder than many think), and they&amp;#39;d probably do anything to avoid having to make design decisions and worry about server costs. They just want to write somewhere their work will be read. And Medium lets them do that. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A call to help Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-23-vanuatu-cyclone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vanuatu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of us who live in temperate climates, it&amp;#39;s difficult to imagine
the unfolding horror of a category 5 tropical cyclone bearing down on your
home with winds exceeding 200 mph. But that was the scenario facing the
inhabitants of the far flung islands of Vanuatu recently. The tiny Pacific
Ocean island archipelago took a direct hit from Cyclone Pam, resulting in
many villages being entirely flattened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly and thankfully, the death toll as a result of the storm has been kept to a minimum, but a large section of the population has been left without food, water, and housing. Now a major relief operation is underway involving NGOs and neighbouring governments from the South Pacific region such as New Zealand and Australia. Technology is also playing a part in the recovery with power and communications providers rallying to get services running again quickly. We have seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://pacificpolicy.org/2015/03/surviving-cyclone-pam/&quot;&gt;encouraging reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that some progress is being made, against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the first time a huge cyclone has ravaged communities in the
Pacific. Typhoon Haiyan wreaked havoc across the islands of the Philippines
in 2013. You may recall our efforts to contribute during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html&quot;&gt;Haiyan relief
operation&lt;/a&gt;. With your help, we will be financially supporting UNICEF&amp;#39;s operation on the ground in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu&quot;&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt; today with an immediate donation of $6,500. We are thrilled to learn that our cash will pack twice the punch because New Zealand philanthropists Gareth and Jo Morgan have agreed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org.nz/UNICEF-New-Zealand-issues-fundraising-challenge-to-reach-82000-children-in-Vanuatu&quot;&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; the first $1 million in donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname has a longstanding policy of setting aside 10 cents from every
domain registration for charitable purposes, but with the crisis being so
great, we&amp;#39;ve dug a bit deeper to help out our neighbours in their time of need. If you want to make your own donation to the Vanuatu relief fund, you can do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The story of how Buffer bought buffer.com, and why a short .com isn&#39;t necessary for startup success</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-19-buffer-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buffer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.bufferapp.com/acquired-buffer-com/&quot;&gt;From Rodolphe Dutel - Buffer:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a great blogpost that Joel wrote on how to name your startup, where he mentioned that the domain name of your startup doesn’t matter. In fact, thinking about Buffer’s own domain history, we originally started out with bfffr.com, when Joel launched Buffer in late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joel went on to change it to bufferapp.com, to make things more clear and worry less about not having the exact domain of your startup’s name, “Buffer” in our case. It can be a huge time-suck in the early days of your company, where your first and foremost goal should be to hit product-market fit and building something people want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending time on acquiring a certain domain name could be a very futile exercise without a product that works. In fact, as Joel illustrates, most well-known companies all had “placeholder” domains for a long time before they got their actual name as their domain too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Square was squareup.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DropBox was getdropbox.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook was thefacebook.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram was instagr.am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter was twttr.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foursquare was playfoursquare.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary point of the post is to tell the story of how Buffer acquired buffer.com, but the real story to me is that while most of us aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;generat(ing) over $5m/year,&amp;quot; and probably don&amp;#39;t have the time or money to pay what it would cost to get a short .com in 2015, there&amp;#39;s no reason you can&amp;#39;t get to that level of success with a domain name you find less than perfect. Buffer had a $60m valuation while using bufferapp.com, and the roster of huge brands listed in the post that started with dodgy domains is pretty incredible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take anything away from this, it&amp;#39;s that the domain name you choose is only a minor piece of a very large puzzle. Before you go throwing resources at the domain aftermarket, just grab a name that fits and make your product as solid as it can possibly be. Good work attracts customers—your domain is just a sticker on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On the sad stagnation of Virb</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/blog/what-happened-to-virb-after-godaddy-acquired-it&quot;&gt;From Steve Benjamins - Site Builder Report:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture at Virb began to shift after the GoDaddy acquisition. There were now new bosses and new goals— but not ones that aligned with Virb’s original vision. The 4 original Virb team members decided it was time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was clear to me that our new leadership wanted to extract as much money from our customers as possible.” Ryan Clark, Virb’s Product Manager and Creative Director at the time says. “Our new directive was simple: revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the Virb team was denied any resources. After losing the 4 original Virb team members Clark notes, “All of my requests to fill the positions disappeared in the ether of the acquisition. It seemed clear to me that GoDaddy had no intention of backing up their new goals for us with the resources to actually achieve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t so much an indictment of GoDaddy, as they clearly acquired Media Temple to better compete in the web hosting game (Virb just happened to be part of the deal), but it&amp;#39;s sad to see a once-promising platform slow to a grind. As a writer who frequently uses all-in-one platforms to get ideas on the web, I&amp;#39;ve primarily moved on to Squarespace. It&amp;#39;s fast enough, beautiful, and best of all, dead simple to use. Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll see other hosted, all-in-one solutions take up the torch though—competition in the space is what drives innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the future of Virb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallgren speculates that GoDaddy will let Virb “die a slow death and collect the money being made on it in the meantime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this most effects the 20,000 customers who still rely on Virb to provide a stable, contemporary website— unfortunately, it’s not clear how stable that future is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
