	<p>It has already been a very busy year at iwantmyname, and once again we&rsquo;re right back into supporting local events and communities here in New Zealand. This year, Lenz and I took up an invitation to be mentors at <a href="http://lightninglab.co.nz/">Lightning Lab</a>, a web venture accelerator that promotes lean methodologies and has attracted angel investment from far and wide. Lightning Lab takes very early stage web start-ups and puts them through a TechStars style programme that challenges founders to break down and reconstruct every aspect of their business.</p>

<p>For the second year running <a href="http://demoday.lightninglab.co.nz/">Lightning Lab Demo Day</a> presented ventures that stayed the course, putting their best feet forward with a pitch to a large group of potential angel investors and with the support of the wider tech start-up community. Showcase projects ranged across the spectrum. <a href="http://coachseek.com/">CoachSeek</a> is an application that handles the administrative burden for sports coaches and has already signed 300 customers worldwide. <a href="http://archived.link/http://www.cogodigital.co.nz/">Cogo</a> is an online knowledge management tool for small and medium sized businesses. <a href="http://mish.guru/">MishGuru</a> grabbed a cool new <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.GURU</a> domain off us and bravely rebuilt their proposal from the ground up, reconfiguring as an overlay that helps businesses leverage popular social media service SnapChat.</p>

	<p>May was quite the month for new top-level domains (TLDs). We saw a new popularity leader, a handful of potential favorites and a TLD for the best little island country in the Pacific. Let&rsquo;s take a look back at the month that was.</p>

<h3>The popular pair</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.CLUB</a> (#1)</li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert">.EXPERT</a> (#17)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was exciting to see <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/this-club-is-quite-popular.html">.CLUB overtake .GURU in the top spot</a>, but the biggest surprise for me was .EXPERT sneaking into the top 20. Being a slightly more direct version of .GURU, .EXPERT seems to be finding its audience, even though it comes with a slightly higher price tag. Will it stay in the top 20 though? Not if new top-level domains like .WIKI have anything to say about it.</p>

	<p>We&rsquo;re not really in the business of pushing one top-level domain (TLD) over another (we love all our children the same), but before the launch of these new domain extensions, one TLD seemed to be more active than the rest. Instead of letting things come down to chance, the team behind <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.CLUB</a> did real legwork—actively starting conversations and making things happen.</p>

<p>And their hard work seems to be paying off, as .CLUB is now the <a href="http://namestat.org/">most popular</a> new generic top-level domain (gTLD) on the market, with daily growth more than 10x that of the second place gTLD, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.GURU</a>. And that growth doesn&rsquo;t seem to be slowing down.</p>

Over the course of two days, we have eight gTLDs coming out, with a couple of them sure to hover around the top 20 in popularity. We have:</p>

	<p>In the past, working for big companies, I&rsquo;d frequently notice a strange communications phenomenon. If I sent someone a quick chat message or email with a question or request for info, they would respond — by calling me or coming over to my desk.</p>

<p>It took me a while to figure out why people wouldn&rsquo;t just reply via the same channel as the inquiry. But eventually it sunk in that different people just prefer to communicate in different ways. Everyone has a mental hierarchy of the preference, value, appropriateness, and efficiency of different types of communication. These are based on their own personalities, modes of learning, and past experience.</p>

<p>This is why when some people need help, the one and only goal is, <em>&ldquo;If I can just get a human on the phone&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>

	<p>In my last post I talked about the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html">one salary experiment</a> and got a lot of feedback. One point that kept coming up was that we may run into the problem of a limited talent pool as we have no real way of attracting anyone with a higher salary than we currently pay. While this may be a limiting factor, the salary is only one aspect of working at iwantmyname. Today, I&rsquo;ll talk about a second aspect, one that also addresses our talent pool size.</p>

<p>We are a company built on the idea that we want to be able to work from anywhere, and because we&rsquo;re an Internet-based business, we have no need for a fixed location. We work on a global network, and as long as we have access to it, we can be productive. And we&rsquo;re not alone in this—<a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/being-a-remote-team">quite a few startups have shifted to working either entirely as a distributed team</a> or with remote workers who contribute. But we, as with many things, try to push this envelope.</p>

	<p>Jonas Downey on his <a href="http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3752-its-ok-not-to-use-tools">process to improve a website</a> for a local non-profit animal shelter &ndash; via Signal v. Noise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, a basic HTML/CSS site seems almost passé. But why? Is it because our new tools are so significantly better, or because we’ve gone overboard complicating simple things?</p>

<p>As builders, we like tools and tech because they’re interesting and new, and we enjoy mastering them. But when you think about the people we’re building for, the reality is usually the opposite. They need simple designs, clear writing, less tech, and fewer abstractions. They want to get stray animals adopted, not fuss around with website stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As builders, it <em>is</em> OK to use tools if they&rsquo;re designed to help the people you&rsquo;re building for. We know how a site should look and feel, so why not use a <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder">website builder</a> like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address">Weebly</a> or <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/wix-make-flash-website-own-url">Wix</a> to set it up, then pass on the final result to the clients to manage?</p>

	<p>Real estate is, and will likely always be, a huge employment sector. But for many real estate agents, the web has just recently become a necessary tool of the trade. These days, websites are the first points of reference for home buyers and the biggest marketing tool any agent will possess. And that makes finding a memorable domain name hugely important.</p>
