<p>You will need to follow the instructions outlined in <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp">ICANN&#39;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</a> (UDRP). Consulting a lawyer may also be useful in ensuring your case is as strong as possible. </p>

<p>Note, however, that even though you own the trademark, a domain squatter will still likely fight to keep the domain, since it was purchased in the first place to make money. Getting the domain name may be expensive, but if you own the trademark (or are a celebrity), you have a good chance of getting the domain from the squatter. Really, it comes down to whether it&#39;s worth the trouble to you.</p>

<p>Domain squatting (occasionally still called cybersquatting) typically happens for one of two reasons. </p>

<p>The owner could be holding the domain for a period of time to build up interest, then offer it for public sale in hopes of a bidding war. The owner could also be squatting to profit from the domain more immediately. This could be done by running a bunch of ads on a parking page, by offering the domain for rent to another entity (so you could use the domain and put up a site, but wouldn&#39;t own it), or by attempting to quickly sell the domain for much more than was paid for it. </p>

<p>Another domain squatting tactic is to buy expired domain names in the hopes that the owners let them expire by accident and will want them back, and are willing to pay a premium for them.</p>

<p>Having your own domain name, even if it&#39;s not perfect, is far more important than building your online presence on top of another service&#39;s URL, e.g. yourshop.shopify.com or facebook.com/yourcompany. This practice of building your brand, service or web presence on another organization&#39;s platform is an example of &quot;sharecropping&quot;. It can be problematic for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>The other platform you&#39;re hosted on controls how your presence can look or function (e.g. templates and tiered feature offerings depending on how much you pay). The other platform can change services or raise rates, leaving you little recourse since not accepting/paying could mean losing your site. </p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html">the previous part of this post series</a>, you can look for a variant of &quot;theperfectdomain&quot;. But be aware of potential confusion if the domain extension (e.g. .NET / .GURU / .CA) is the only difference between your domain and someone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>You could try small changes to the domain name you want. Like adding or dropping an article. Instead of &quot;companyname&quot;, use &quot;thecompanyname&quot; or &quot;getproductname&quot;. Again, there is still a good chance people will get confused.</p>

<p>Instead of directly referring to your company, group, or topic name, you could focus on something relevant and important, like what the product or service enables you to do. A photographer could register a domain using &quot;shoot&quot; or &quot;snap&quot;, or referencing &quot;memories&quot;. A group of pilots could use &quot;fly&quot; or &quot;wings&quot; or &quot;soar&quot;. Using slang or terminology common among your group could make for a memorable domain name as well.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve started a business, a club or a blog. You&#39;ve got plenty of work ahead of you, and you&#39;re excited about it. Your idea is fantastic, you&#39;ve got so much you want to share with the world, and most importantly, you&#39;ve picked out a fantastic name. It&#39;s clever, descriptive and easy to remember. Now to register the domain name.</p>

<p>Or not.</p>

<p>Trying to get The Perfect Domain can be really frustrating. Or, at the very least, really expensive. <a href="http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/24/after-losing-over-25000-registrations-in-two-days-com-back-below-113-million-berlin-top-40k/">Well over 100 million .COM domains are currently registered.</a> Which means  that &quot;the good ones&quot; are probably taken. Estimates are that the total number of registered domains topped a quarter of a <em>billion</em> last year. (Estimates are that nearly half consist of <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial">.COM</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network">.NET</a>.) </p>

<p>Plus, there doesn&#39;t even have to be an associated website for a domain name to be registered and unavailable to you. What&#39;s a person to do in the quest to register the perfect domain name? Well, there are a few options, which we&#39;ll break down for you in this series on what to do if the domain you want is already registered.</p>

<p>I went through a little exercise yesterday while trying to find a great domain name for a side project. Nothing too scientific, but the whole process reminded me of how hard it is to settle on a single domain for a brand. Do you go with relevant keywords? Throw caution to the wind and select something obscure? Use a new generic top-level domain (gTLD)?</p>

<p>For this example, let&#39;s go through the naming process for an imaginary tech review blog.</p>

<p>103 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">available on iwantmyname</a> now, and nearly 900,000 gTLD domains have been registered throughout the web since the big launch. May saw quite a bit of growth as far as gTLDs go, but June may be the biggest one yet with the launch of 27 new domain extensions, including .XYZ, .REVIEWS, .EVENTS, .SOCIAL and .DATING. Check out the full list below.</p>

<p>It has already been a very busy year at iwantmyname, and once again we&#39;re right back into supporting local events and communities here in New Zealand. This year, Lenz and I took up an invitation to be mentors at <a href="http://lightninglab.co.nz/">Lightning Lab</a>, a web venture accelerator that promotes lean methodologies and has attracted angel investment from far and wide. Lightning Lab takes very early stage web start-ups and puts them through a TechStars style programme that challenges founders to break down and reconstruct every aspect of their business.</p>

<p>For the second year running <a href="http://demoday.lightninglab.co.nz/">Lightning Lab Demo Day</a> presented ventures that stayed the course, putting their best feet forward with a pitch to a large group of potential angel investors and with the support of the wider tech start-up community. Showcase projects ranged across the spectrum. <a href="http://coachseek.com/">CoachSeek</a> is an application that handles the administrative burden for sports coaches and has already signed 300 customers worldwide. <a href="http://archived.link/http://www.cogodigital.co.nz/">Cogo</a> is an online knowledge management tool for small and medium sized businesses. <a href="http://mish.guru/">MishGuru</a> grabbed a cool new <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.GURU</a> domain off us and bravely rebuilt their proposal from the ground up, reconfiguring as an overlay that helps businesses leverage popular social media service SnapChat.</p>

<p>May was quite the month for new top-level domains (TLDs). We saw a new popularity leader, a handful of potential favorites and a TLD for the best little island country in the Pacific. Let&#39;s take a look back at the month that was.</p>

<h3>The popular pair</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.CLUB</a> (#1)</li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert">.EXPERT</a> (#17)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was exciting to see <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/this-club-is-quite-popular.html">.CLUB overtake .GURU in the top spot</a>, but the biggest surprise for me was .EXPERT sneaking into the top 20. Being a slightly more direct version of .GURU, .EXPERT seems to be finding its audience, even though it comes with a slightly higher price tag. Will it stay in the top 20 though? Not if new top-level domains like .WIKI have anything to say about it.</p>
