	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p>I&#39;m a bit of a rabid podcast listener, and like any fan of a given medium, I have lots of opinions. I like Downcast more than any other podcast app, I like story driven shows over freeform conversations, and I really love NPR&#39;s Planet Money. </p>

<p>And this week&#39;s Planet Money, titled &quot;The Wild West Of The Internet,&quot; was right up my alley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are over 100 million websites ending in .com. But new options for website names are becoming available. Not only is there .com and .gov .edu, but now .ninja has been added. Also .bike, .plumbing and .cool. In all, over 1,000 new top-level domains, as they are called, will be added.</p>

<p>Today on the show, what happens when you just create a whole bunch of real estate out of nowhere? We meet some of the new land barons with big dreams. And a guy who worries it&#39;s just going to be a big mess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of the show, or just want to get a better grasp on what&#39;s going on with these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/16/303735386/episode-532-the-wild-west-of-the-internet">give this episode a listen</a>. I think you&#39;ll enjoy it. </p>

<p>What happens when you give a creative person too many ways to solve a relatively simple problem?</p>

<p>I can tell you firsthand. Panic attacks.</p>

<p>When the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were announced a few years back, my hope was that they would all fit into tidy categories. Of course there wouldn&#39;t be any overlapping TLDs—that would be madness. Absolute madness!</p>

<p>Well, skip to today and check out my own personal nightmare. Instead of fitting a brand name to a catch-all gTLD, we have <em>six</em> good gTLDs for the photography category (and plenty more in close orbit, like .CAM and .CAMERA). We have:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery">.GALLERY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo">.PHOTO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos">.PHOTOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography">.PHOTOGRAPHY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics">.PICS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pictures">.PICTURES</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So which one should a photographer choose? And what should people be thinking about when choosing one over another?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about the future of these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), and no matter where my mind takes me, I always return to one question—what&#39;s in a name?</p>

<p>Specifically, what makes one TLD better than any other TLD?</p>

<p>As you likely know, we are now coming to understand the full implications of the OpenSSL vulnerability (aka the &quot;<a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed bug</a>&quot;) that was disclosed last week. <a href="http://xkcd.com/1354/">Here is an excellent graphical explanation of the vulnerability.</a> New angles of attack against vulnerable infrastructure come up every day. </p>

<p>(Have you patched your home router and updated your passwords after <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">checking sites for vulnerability</a>?)</p>

<p>At iwantmyname, we patched all servers the day the vulnerability was disclosed. However, we also did more. Read on for more in-depth information on how we handle our security, and recommendations for our customers on managing their accounts and passwords.</p>

<p>I generally don&#39;t like to overhype things, but the sheer volume of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out next week is a big deal. Over the course of three days (April 15-17), 14 domain extensions will be going live, and a few of them are likely to be quite popular.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the full list:</p>

		<a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/microsoft-ends-free-custom-domain-email-here-are-five-alternatives.html">Microsoft ends free email for custom domains. Here are 5 alternatives.</a>
	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p>As reported by ZDNet, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-ends-support-for-custom-domains-in-free-email-service-7000028306/?s_cid=e589&amp;ttag=e589&amp;ftag=TREc64629f">Microsoft ends support for custom domains in free email service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Mike Schackwitz, Principal Group Program Manager for the Outlook.com service, Microsoft will “wind down the Custom Domains product” while continuing to support existing custom email addresses “indefinitely.” The service has been in existence since 2005.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the good news is that existing accounts will remain active. However, if you were used to setting up your iwantmyname domains using Microsoft&#39;s email hosting service, you now need a new tool in your online toolbelt. Our own Chris Hall wrote a neat article on <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html">how to get a custom email address</a> last year, which lists several alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite">Zoho Mail</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain">Google Apps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain">Fastmail.FM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/rackspace-apps">Rackspace</a></li>
<li><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding">Pobox.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Zoho Mail is the only one still offering free accounts, but we all know that this might change eventually. If you&#39;re not a fan of Google, we found FastMail a great alternative and Pobox will certainly do the trick for email forwarding only.</p>

		<p>It started with a <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">big list</a>. And we were quite pleased with our big list, but it needed more context. So we built categories and buckets for released and about-to-be-released gTLDs—and it worked out great. But one more thing was needed. </p>

<p>We needed a way to show all the gTLD launch information we know, and we needed it to update automatically so it wouldn&#39;t require insane amounts of time to manually maintain. So we built it, and we&#39;re really happy with how it turned out. </p>

<p>Say hi to our new <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates">gTLD launch calendar</a>. It has launch dates and prices for all the gTLDs we have information on, and it&#39;s quite easy on the eyes. </p>

<p>Pre-orders for all listed gTLDs are open until the launch date given, so get your domain on the list before it&#39;s open to the public.</p>

<p>And now, with the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), drink makers can tap into this liquid love with domain names categorized for their craft.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any rhyme or reason to it, but it seems like each week&#39;s batch of new TLDs has a theme. Two weeks ago we had a group of gTLDs with an <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/this-week-in-gtlds-is-rigged-up-for-the-it-crowd-plus-some-thoughts-on-email.html">IT theme</a>.
