				<title>The guide to adding Squarespace to your iwantmyname domain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing, all-in-one site builder that makes top-end web design accessible to everyone. Seriously, with no skill going in, you&amp;#39;ll be able to build sites, stores, photo galleries, and blogs in minutes. It&amp;#39;s that intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s not quite as intuitive though is the domain setup. We pride ourselves in providing one-click installs to a ton of platforms, but sometimes there&amp;#39;s an extra step involved that can turn that one click into a bunch of clicks. Have no fear though, with this short guide, you&amp;#39;ll have your domain working with your Squarespace site in no time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Get started with Squarespace by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace homepage&lt;/a&gt;, choosing a template, then clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Start With This Design&lt;/strong&gt; button. There are a couple quick questions you can answer after that, or you can skip them for now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-home.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace home&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; From Squarespace&amp;#39;s side navigation, click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Domains&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Connect a Third-Party Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Enter your domain name in the Domain Name field provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-domain-iwantmyblog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Add domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Select &lt;strong&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/strong&gt; from the Domain Provider dropdown list. Click &lt;strong&gt;Connect Domain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-select-iwantmyname.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dropdown iwantmyname&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Squarespace is now linking your domain. Click &lt;strong&gt;okay&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-in-progress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Click okay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Copy that long string of letters and numbers listed first under the Host column (it&amp;#39;ll look somehting like: abcde1fg2h3ijk4lmn5o). This is the verification code you&amp;#39;ll add in the iwantmyname dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-host.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Copy string&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; Open a new window and log into your iwantmyname account and head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/setup/Squarespace/&quot;&gt;Squarespace app setup page&lt;/a&gt;. Click Add Squarespace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt;You&amp;#39;ve already signed up for squarespace, so now add the verification code to the &amp;#39;Unique verification code&amp;#39; input. Then click &lt;strong&gt;Install Squarespace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-unique-ver.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Unique Code&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; Back on your Squarespace window, if you click &lt;strong&gt;Refresh&lt;/strong&gt;, everything should now say Correct. Sometimes it takes a bit (up to a few hours) for these things to work through the internet though, so don&amp;#39;t be alarmed if things don&amp;#39;t look correct right away. Just jump to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-05-11-squarespace-correct.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Correct&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;re all done! Have fun building your Squarespace site!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Taking stock of our 2015 community involvement</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being involved in the local community is vastly important to us, so this year we made a conscious decision to support more events that at least some of the iwantmyname team could actively participate in. Since we are already one-third of the way through 2015, I think it&amp;#39;s about time to take stock of what has been achieved so far and look at where we plan to go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekends loom large in our consciousness, and this year has been no exception. Organisers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupweekend.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekends here in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have a busy schedule planned, and we&amp;#39;ve already been lucky enough to sponsor and participate in the recent Wellington event. Lenz and I put on our mentor hats, Kevin Ingersoll participated in a team, and Coco the domain dog lent moral support by snoozing blissfully throughout. So imagine our excitement when the judges announced that Kevin&amp;#39;s team had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmynameNZ/status/587195037274005504&quot;&gt;scored a well-earned win&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrills of Startup Weekend were soon followed by intellectual debate and thorough workshopping of the open source paradigm at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourceopensociety.com/&quot;&gt;Open Source Open Society conference&lt;/a&gt;, held in conjunction with Github and Enspiral. We employ open source technologies and open thinking &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html&quot;&gt;throughout our business&lt;/a&gt;, so it seemed like the perfect event for us to be a part of. There was also a cool closing party with a funky, indie DJ on tap, so nobody wanted to leave—but that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also remain keen backers of the PHP Meetup and JavaScript Meetup in our city, and have been helping out with the R9 initiative, an experimental incubator aiming to solve important business problems in the government sector by using lean methodologies. Many of these events have our local tech business incubator &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativehq.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Creative HQ&lt;/a&gt; at their heart, so we&amp;#39;re more than thrilled to be announcing a strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this week on, we will be shouting the beers at the highly popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/StartupGarage/&quot;&gt;Startup Garage&lt;/a&gt; Meetup. Each month, Creative HQ hosts an interesting speaker from the start-up world, many of whom bring wisdom from afar. Recent appearances have included SXSW organiser Shawn O&amp;#39;Keefe and President of Y Combinator, Sam Altman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 is shaping up to be a big year for community involvement here at iwantmyname, and we&amp;#39;re excited to make further inroads in the local start-up ecosystem. If you see us around, come say hi! We&amp;#39;d love to chat. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making customer support sustainable with a small team based on a tiny island</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what service you offer or product you sell, a good chunk of any business is customer support. But unlike many other aspects of running a business, how companies handle customer support can vary widely, even among companies in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our little corner of the Internet, the domain industry, we have a couple of unique challenges. First, domain registration is a comparatively low margin business, so to keep our business afloat, we rely on the support of a lot of customers. Tens of thousands, with 150,000+ domains under management. And no matter how stable your platform, when you&amp;#39;re dealing with that many moving parts, any flaw, bug, or confusing process will be uncovered very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is the clock. Most of the iwantmyname team is in New Zealand, but what happens when it&amp;#39;s 10pm, and someone has an issue in London, where it&amp;#39;s only 11am? Is it acceptable to pass on the expectation that people need sleep? It&amp;#39;s an honest question, and a concern for many small companies that can&amp;#39;t afford to have 24-hour call centers or offices all around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is an instant answer world without any face-to-face dialogue, which strips a lot of the humanity out of the process. And we all fall into it—if my website breaks, I expect instant answers, but if my car breaks, I know I have to set an appointment during business hours. It&amp;#39;s all about setting expectations, and that&amp;#39;s one of the hardest things for businesses to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//giphy.com/embed/j62Hmj6SMpJV6?html5=true&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle the support load, companies can go a few different directions. As I stated before, they can stock up a support team or outsource all the support to a third party, but that&amp;#39;s expensive, impersonal, and honestly, a little underwhelming in the experience department. Sure, there are a lot of quick Q&amp;amp;A type issues that can be handled quickly by anyone with basic knowledge of the domain industry, but if you have a real problem, you want real solutions. Nothing is more aggravating than dealing with a support layer that clearly won&amp;#39;t be able to solve your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue with stocking up a support team is our rather unique salary structure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;ve written about it before&lt;/a&gt;, but our philosophy from the start has been to pay everyone on the team a flat wage. On the customer side, it may be frustrating to not see us hire 20 low-wage support specialists, but we strongly believe in companies providing livable wages to their employees. As Lenz, one of our co-founders, has said in the past, the wellbeing of the team is just as important as the well-being of the company. People are important, and as they grow, the company grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after years of dual roles and unsustainable hours, it was clear that a distributed support team was a must. We needed a better way to support the Americas on Fridays (which are Saturdays in NZ), and we needed a way to cover the middle of the world during normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we hired Melle (last year), who in eastern Canada could take on American business hours—and what a difference it made. With her in Canada and the rest of the dual-role supporters in NZ, we could roughly cover 17 hours of the day, Tuesday-Friday, with people working a typical 8am-5pm day, then nine hours on NZ Mondays and Saturdays (Fridays in Canada). But still, if someone had an issue in London on Monday at 9am, it would be in the wee early morning for Melle, and well past dinner for the New Zealanders. Life was certainly better, but there were still support gaps—and our brave co-founder Paul was still sometimes working seven days a week to make sure the support load never got out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth is a tricky thing with a small, bootstrapped team, but our trajectory for 2015 and beyond led us to two very important decisions. To create the best possible experience for our customers, we&amp;#39;d need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a UI designer to help build a solid interface (which, through organization and clear instructions, will hopefully cut down our future support load quite a bit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a second supporter in Europe to cover our gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Kevin, who was hired a few months back, has been hard at work on new interface ideas. And our newest iwantmynamer, Steffi, is working through support cases from her house in Germany (and she&amp;#39;s quite awesome at it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, with three support &amp;quot;teams&amp;quot; scattered around the planet, we&amp;#39;re roughly covering 23 hours of the day, Tuesday-Friday, then 15 hours on Saturday, all without stretching any of our work schedules beyond a reasonable amount. New Zealand Sundays are still a hole for us, so we typically only cover urgent cases then, but as long as we set the right expectations, our email-based support system is perfect for getting everything worked out in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often get asked why we don&amp;#39;t offer a phone service or an instant-on online chat, and the answer is simple—instant communication is inefficient, and often leads to answers that aren&amp;#39;t fully thought out or articulated well. Quite a few things have to happen to answer a support question successfully. We have to get the problem, understand the problem, find the problem, take the steps to fix it, and then break down an easily actionable solution. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s as easy as sending a link, but other times issues need to be handled by multiple people in multiple places (registries, platforms, etc.), which aren&amp;#39;t always under our control. And that takes time—especially when there are questions in the queue coming in from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;email-only support&lt;/a&gt;, we can get to each question as fast as humanly possible without wasting our customers&amp;#39; valuable time sitting on hold or finding their way through strange automated systems. And with our support answers all in written form, we can easily build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;knowledge base&lt;/a&gt; full of quick answers to common questions. It&amp;#39;s been working well for us so far (&lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;96% love it!&lt;/a&gt;), and hopefully it&amp;#39;ll only get better as our interface becomes easier and easier to use and navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Everything you need to know about domain hacks</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-domain-dot-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;domain dot hack&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of domain registration (the dark times before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; were launched), there was a point where it was quite hard to find a domain that was both short and memorable. Many of the good &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; domain names were taken, as were the more common words and phrases in various country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.CO.UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt;. So what do people commonly do when there&amp;#39;s a shortage of something that&amp;#39;s in demand? They get creative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a domain hack is to take a word or brand, like iwantmyname, and use the domain extension as part of the word. So instead of iwantmyname.com, a domain hacker would go with iwantmyna.me (using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; TLD) or iwantmy.name (using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt; TLD). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are domain hacks useful?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-street-art.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;street art&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is street art useful? Not really, but it sure is fun to look at. With a domain hack, you can create a domain name that&amp;#39;s uniquely yours—one that may align with your whimsical brand mentality better than a .COM ever could. If the last few letters in your name happen to be a ccTLD, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&quot;&gt;.IS&lt;/a&gt; in Chris, then you have yourself a good domain hack (chr.is). If the last few letters in your brand happen to be a new gTLD, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&quot;&gt;.PRESS&lt;/a&gt; in Express, then you have yourself another (ex.press). Or if you just want to make something up, like beeris.gd... you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we like domain hacks though, there are some downsides you should be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a domain hack for your primary domain might not be a good idea (we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1418597-how-do-i-set-up-forwarding-with-my-domain-&quot;&gt;forwarding&lt;/a&gt; domain hacks to a primary domain). With more and more people using search engines and social media to browse the web this is less of an issue, but if you go with anything other than .COM or your local ccTLD, you&amp;#39;re bound to get people typing in the wrong thing. For instance, if our primary domain was iwantmyna.me, I&amp;#39;d guess that at least half (probably more) would reflexively type in iwantmyname.com. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain hacks are hard to say out loud. Again, as more and more people navigate with search engines and social it&amp;#39;s less of a big deal, but if you&amp;#39;re in an interview or meeting and have to say your domain name, you don&amp;#39;t want to sound like you&amp;#39;re stumbling over yourself. Just try to say chr.is out loud. &amp;quot;c-h-r-dot-i-s.&amp;quot; Or possibly &amp;quot;chris, but with the dot before the i-s.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s much easier to say &amp;quot;chris.com.&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about domain hacks for URL shortening?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-short-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Short link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Twitter was first created, links were a real problem. Just picture it—you have 140 characters to complete a thought, and links can be quite long. If you wanted to send a link to our .COM page (iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial), you&amp;#39;re looking at a hefty 67 characters. To get around that link bloat, a bunch of companies created shortening solutions which linked desired (long) URL&amp;#39;s to a short URL, like bit.ly/XXXXXX or ow.ly/XXXXXX (the XXXXXX being a randomly generated, unique string of characters). Then, using custom domain names, you could brand your short URL&amp;#39;s using your own custom domain name, so instead of bit.ly/XXXXXX, tweets would show something like iwmn.me/XXXXXX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Twitter wraps everything in their t.co URL shortener (which uses the original URL&amp;#39;s metadata to show a truncated version of the original URL), but companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&quot;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; are still proving useful by giving users valuable link analytics for their tweets (or other social posts). If you have a data-driven approach to social media, link shortening platforms are still quite useful. But they certainly aren&amp;#39;t the must-have tools they used to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are there any tools for finding domain hacks?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-29-domain-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;iwantmyname search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not specifically looking for one, domain hacks can be tricky to think up. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyname domain search&lt;/a&gt; has a basic domain hack finder built in. Just type any word in, and the second result (if applicable) will be a domain hack using one of our many domain extensions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a bit more though, try doing a search over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainr.com&quot;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt;. Doing the same search I did above (whatismydomainname), they pulled out some crazy stuff like whatismydomainn.am/e, whatismydoma.in.na/me, and whatismydomain.na/me. Pretty fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Registering .au domains without the .com part may soon become reality</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/18367-australia-considers-dumping-the-com&quot;&gt;DomainIncite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian domain overseer auDA is thinking about allowing people to register .au domains directly at the second level for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization has opened up a consultation that would allow registrations such as example.au, rather than just the current system of example.com.au, example.org.au and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move follows the successful recent releases of 2LDs in the UK (.uk) and New Zealand (.nz) ccTLDs and can be seen as a bid to remain competitive in the face of the new gTLD program’s huge expansion of TLD choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s good news for Australian domain owners! Let’s just hope this also results in making it easier to obtain domains and not have people jump through hoops as with the current registration policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, .com.au currently requires you to provide a company ID such as and Australian Business Number when purchasing a domain name which makes it difficult for somebody just starting out. And individuals are not allowed to register .com.au at all but need to go with .id.au instead. However, domains under .id.au must either match your real name or be closely connected to you and might be declined if not. Talk about making it complicated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, Australians might as well consider other alternatives for their online identity like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (or the recently mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/04/reach-an-international-audience-with-these-country-code-top-level-domains.html&quot;&gt;gccTLDs&lt;/a&gt;) which you can specifically target at local visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Reach an international audience with these 19 country code top-level domains</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the process of starting a new website and want to go with a shorter country domain extension rather than any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (or .COM), there&amp;#39;s one thing you should know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google treats some ccTLDs (such as .tv, .me, etc.) as gTLDs, as we’ve found that users and webmasters frequently see these more generic than country-targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1347922?hl=en&quot;&gt;set a geographic target through Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. use a .co domain and be listed in search results in the United States, Canada or France although it is actually Colombia’s top-level domain. The same is true if you don’t want to target a specific country, i.e. have a .me domain for your personal online profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But which ones of these so-called gccTLDs (generic country code top-level domains) are the most popular and more likely to be recognized by visitors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at Verisign’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/domain-name-report-march2015.pdf&quot;&gt;latest domain industry brief&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-21-gcctld-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;verisign graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ccTLDs, including .tk, .co, .me and .tv are frequently used by registrants and treated by search engines as gTLDs. This chart ranks the zone size of both gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs, as of Dec. 31, 2014, with that classification taken into account. The top 10 largest gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs by zone size were .com, .tk, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .co, .mobi, .me and .tv, as of Dec. 31, 2014, which account for 180.6 million domain name registrations, or 62.8 percent of the total global domain name registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau&quot;&gt;.tk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.co&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.me&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.tv&lt;/a&gt; as the most popular gccTLDs in that list. Not surprising, except .tk which offers free domains—but with certain usage restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other popular ones you may have seen are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io&lt;/a&gt; for tech sites (which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/&quot;&gt;still on the rise&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.fm&lt;/a&gt; for music websites, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands&quot;&gt;.cc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa&quot;&gt;.ws&lt;/a&gt; for general use, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nu-domain-name-registration-for-niue&quot;&gt;.nu&lt;/a&gt; (popular in Scandinavian countries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesser known gccTLDs, but often registered for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; because they don’t require any special documentation or local address in the country, are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&quot;&gt;.la&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.ms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.sc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/as-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-american-samoa&quot;&gt;.as&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize&quot;&gt;.bz&lt;/a&gt; suffixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the remaining geo-targetable domain extensions from Google’s list: .ad, .cd, .dj, .sr, and .su. Unfortunately, we don&amp;#39;t carry these domains because they&amp;#39;re not easy to purchase and maintain, so you&amp;#39;d have to choose another registrar (our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainr.com&quot;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help with that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the overall result if we were to rank the ccTLD&amp;#39;s by international popularity, user recognition, and how easy they are to obtain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best: .co, .me, .tv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good: .io, .fm, .ws, .nu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe: .la, .ms, .sc, .as, .bz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average: .ad, .cd, .dj, .sr, .su&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it also depends on the type of website you are launching, but for businesses you should probably stick to the “best” and “good” categories.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Contacting the owner of a domain you want to buy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-20-passing-domain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passing domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published a fairly extensive series a while back to help you figure out what to do if there&amp;#39;s a domain you want that&amp;#39;s already been registered, or similar issues. Two of the most relevant posts for our purposes here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt5.html&quot;&gt;Part 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt6.html&quot;&gt;Part 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t go into a lot of detail about exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to contact the current owner of a domain that you&amp;#39;re interested in acquiring though. Or what to do if you do manage to get in touch and make an offer. We&amp;#39;ll start with the easy way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Contacting a registrant - WHOIS lookup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to your favorite &lt;a href=&quot;http://whois.domaintools.com/&quot;&gt;WHOIS lookup site&lt;/a&gt;, you can enter the domain and get the publicly available details of who owns the domain. Be aware that not all WHOIS lookups are official and present accurate information. Also be aware that sometimes registries (like for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nic.io/&quot;&gt;ccTLDs such as .IO&lt;/a&gt;) have their own WHOIS lookups, which may provide different or additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you want the registrant contact email address, as the registrant is the domain&amp;#39;s legal owner. gTLDs have four registrant contacts: registrant/owner, admin, technical, and billing. These can all be the same person/organization, or four different ones. Some ccTLDs, like .UK, only have two contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Registrant email address considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, just finding an email address for the registrant doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee contact. Particularly if someone has owned a domain for a long time, they may not use the email address anymore that they provided for registration. Lots of things can change: leaving school, getting hacked, and changing addresses, or simply upgrading the email hosting you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, many email clients have stringent spam filtering, and emails from addresses that they&amp;#39;ve never received email from before may not be allowed through automatically. There are lots of articles out there outlining other spam filter triggers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mailchimp.com/most-common-spam-filter-triggers/&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good example.&lt;/a&gt; These are good things to be aware of for how you craft your email to the owner of the domain you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people also use WHOIS privacy services, either provided by their registrar (&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425&quot;&gt;more information about ours&lt;/a&gt;) or by a third-party service. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s obvious when one of these services is in place. For example, for customers using our new WHOIS privacy service, information for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whoistrustee.com/&quot;&gt;WhoisTrustee&lt;/a&gt; will be shown instead of a person or organization&amp;#39;s contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be email addresses shown for the contacts when a WHOIS privacy service is in place, but there&amp;#39;s a chance that the registrant cannot receive email sent to them. (For example, if the underlying email address is outdated or the forwarding filters out certain messages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Registrant is unreachable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever the reason, it is quite possible the registrant&amp;#39;s contact information is not available for the domain you want. Obviously, this presents a problem. Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a solveable one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time people who can&amp;#39;t get contact information for a domain they want contact us to ask us for that information, or to ask us to contact the domain owner for them. We can&amp;#39;t speak for other registrars, but our policy is not to do this. We take customers&amp;#39; privacy very seriously. Additionally, we are not in the brokerage business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that unless the domain is allowed to expire and is released, you may have no way of acquiring it. In these cases we recommend having some viable alternatives. And make sure you&amp;#39;ve secured a domain name &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; printing signs, business cards, etc. (You&amp;#39;d be surprised how often people don&amp;#39;t do this...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Domain brokerage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in having a third party try to contact a domain&amp;#39;s owner for you, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sedo.com/us/buy-domains/domain-brokerage/&quot;&gt;Sedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainagents.com/&quot;&gt;DomainAgents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brokerage services will do is contact the domain owner (if they can), then make an offer for the domain for you, handle negotiations, and finalize the agreement to purchase and transfer the domain. In addition to whatever price you pay for the domain, you will also pay a fee to the broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You&amp;#39;ve contacted the domain owner... now what?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s up to you, really. First, you need to see if the person is interested in parting with the domain. It&amp;#39;s a good idea, when you&amp;#39;re looking up the WHOIS details, to check the date on which the domain was registered. If someone has had the domain for a decade, there may be pretty good odds that they&amp;#39;re not interested in getting rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;#39;s possible the person registered the domain hoping to sell it, but the right buyer just hadn&amp;#39;t come along until you did. And, as we&amp;#39;ve previously mentioned, just because there is no website up for the domain doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not in use or not wanted. There are a lot of ways to use domains that don&amp;#39;t involve publicly accessible websites. (And even if the domain isn&amp;#39;t being used for anything, no, we (&lt;em&gt;nor any other registrar&lt;/em&gt;) can&amp;#39;t just take it for you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you can do is contact the owner and hope they receive the message and reply. If they don&amp;#39;t reply, or they say no, there&amp;#39;s not much you can do. If they are interested, then you have a chance. And typically, if someone is interested in selling a domain, they&amp;#39;ll make it quite easy to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to know beforehand how much you&amp;#39;re willing to spend on the domain. Some domains are quite reasonable, others very, very expensive. Essentially, the domain is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Even if the owner says they&amp;#39;re willing to sell, if they want a million dollars and you don&amp;#39;t have or aren&amp;#39;t willing to pay that, then the domain might as well not be for sale at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, sounding too interested (read: desperate) can make the asking price go up steeply and quickly. And there&amp;#39;s really nothing you can do about it, except walk away. So, again, having a budget and an alternative plan is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#39;ve come to an agreement... now what?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&amp;#39;ve managed to contact the domain owner, they were interested in selling, and now you&amp;#39;ve made a deal. How do you actually get the domain? Well, it depends. For gTLDs (e.g. .COM) the transfer process is standardized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1336688&quot;&gt;There&amp;#39;s information on the requirements here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ccTLDs there can be a lot of variance in what&amp;#39;s required to transfer, so if you have trouble figuring it out or getting started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the domain owner is an iwantmyname customer and so are you, you can do what&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184478&quot;&gt;an internal transfer or move.&lt;/a&gt;. (Provided the domain is old enough, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to transfer the domain from the owner&amp;#39;s account at another registrar to your account with iwantmyname, then the owner would unlock the domain, get the transfer auth code, remove any privacy services, and one of you (whomever has the auth code) would initiate the transfer at our website. (That is for gTLDs. As noted, the process may differ somewhat for ccTLDs.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184465&quot;&gt;More information on transferring TO iwantmyname here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the owner is an iwantmyname customer and you want to transfer the domain to your account at another registrar, then the owner would unlock the domain, get the transfer auth code, remove any privacy services, and one of you (whomever has the auth code) would initiate the transfer at the new registrar&amp;#39;s website. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184477&quot;&gt;More information on transferring FROM iwantmyname here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the domain type and registrars involved, transfers can be immediate, or take up to 5 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, be sure that all payments and other arrangements have been made &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; initiating the transfer. Once a domain has been transferred, it&amp;#39;s likely no longer yours or accessible, and you have no way of getting it back or withholding it to demand payment if you get shafted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anything else?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be the legal owner of a domain, your name and/or organization&amp;#39;s name needs to be in the registrant/owner contact details. This information may not automatically change when a domain is transferred. Be sure to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, you can update the registrant contacts for many types of domains in your dashboard, under &lt;em&gt;edit contacts&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re unable to do that, there may be an issue, or we may need to make the update for you, so let us know. If your domain is registered elsewhere, you&amp;#39;ll need to contact that registrar for help updating the details if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that changing the registrant contact details is often called an &lt;em&gt;owner change&lt;/em&gt;. For some types of domains, this change is considered by registries to be similar to a domain registration, so there may be a fee involved. Some registries also require identification and paperwork to be included. (We can help clarify this as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of millions of domains registered, there is a pretty good chance that one you want is taken already. If it&amp;#39;s one you really want, you may be fortunate and able to procure it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, nowadays at least there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;hundreds of new TLDs&lt;/a&gt; to choose from to help you come up with just the right alternative. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using the iwantmyname Marketplace to find your next blog, personal site, portfolio, or e-commerce platform</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it useful? If so, how can we make it even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions we&amp;#39;ve been asking a lot of ourselves lately, and they represent what I think is the goal of this vast world we call the internet. Just think of the progression from the pre-internet world to now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1970&amp;#39;s - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a record to play at home. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1990&amp;#39;s - You read an album review in a magazine, then drive to the store to buy a CD to play in your car. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000&amp;#39;s - You read an album review online (quite useful), then download the album to listen on any of your devices (still a chore).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The future - The album you want and all the content around it are integrated. There are no barriers. Listen, discover, and share, instantly. I can&amp;#39;t think of anything more useful than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the goal of the internet. Reduce the noise, reduce the work—all so you can instantly get what you want, right when you want it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting at iwantmyname, I used iwantmyname for one very specific reason. They had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;big collection of platforms&lt;/a&gt; available for me to plug-in to without having to find any DNS instructions. When I think of an idea, the last thing I want to do is figure out how to get the thing I want to use up and running. With iwantmyname, I could start sites on platforms like Squarespace, Virb, and Tumblr in a snap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I only subconsciously realized was how much clutter I&amp;#39;d removed from my life. Instead of reading review after review of every new CMS under the sun, I had a place to go that had some cultivation going on. A place where I could quickly check out some of the coolest platforms on the web, and then add them to my domain with just a few clicks. iwantmyname bridged that gap from discovery to creation, and it saved me time. So much time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-16-iwmn-marketplace.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and we have so many hosted platforms to discover in the iwantmyname &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll find big ones like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the platforms that tend to fly under the radar (but are still mighty useful) for non-developers, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Without needing to login or buy anything, you can browse through 100+ platforms, and when you&amp;#39;re ready, you can grab a domain and start creating content in a flash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easily one of the fastest ways to go from platform discovery to site creation on the web while still giving you the flexibility to change platforms in the future and add other useful things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/&quot;&gt;custom forums&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The future of the Marketplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we come back to our original question. How can we make our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; more useful than it is today? A couple weeks ago, the whole team met in Wellington to plan out the future of the site. Plenty of things were discussed, but one of our main focuses was the Marketplace—particularly, what we can do in the future to make it more useful. And the solution (well, at least one of the solutions) was content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vigorously remove any content doesn&amp;#39;t help people get from point A to point B faster, and put a much larger content focus on the platforms we plug-in to than our own. We already have the tools in place to get you going on a platform, and we already have a large (and growing) selection of platforms available. What we&amp;#39;re missing is the added content needed to remove the initial research barrier. Not editorial, but useful content that breaks down what each platform does, and how their featuresets can uniquely work to bring what&amp;#39;s in your head to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-16-future-marketplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Future Marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future Marketplace, you should be able to have a solid idea of what a platform does without having to go searching elsewhere, and hopefully that extra level of information will translate to real time saved. And that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re after. Saving you time so you can get back to building. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about our plans though. Is there anything you&amp;#39;d like to see in the Marketplace to make it more useful? If so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;drop us a message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The nearly foolproof three-step test for determining the quality of a website</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-15-twitter-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter Logos&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Find the social icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; If the Twitter icon isn&amp;#39;t shaped like the birds above (angled slightly up), you&amp;#39;ve probably found a brand that either doesn&amp;#39;t understand the internet or doesn&amp;#39;t care about details (possibly worse?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that there are levels of terribleness here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-15-twitter-logo-old.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old Twitter Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Score -100:&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely the wrong logo, but I can see how someone could see this and not instantly think it&amp;#39;s wrong. If you see something like this on a personal site, politely send an email to the site owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-04-15-twitter-logo-older.png&quot; alt=&quot;Older Twitter Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Score -4000:&lt;/strong&gt; You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant with carpet clearly from the 1980&amp;#39;s? &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Can non-devs be part of the open source community?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9307255&quot;&gt;From thomk - Hacker News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask HN: How do technical non-developers help with open source projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to code for a living but decided that I enjoy being a technical writer and PM much, much more. Things I enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing detailed functional specifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating wireframes &amp;amp; mockups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating flowcharts, BPMN docs &amp;amp; graphs to explain a project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning Poker, Creating sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussing technical issues with developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplifying technical issues for customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning about new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explaining new technology to customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is; Is there a need for someone like me in any open source projects and if so, how do I contribute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lenz &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html&quot;&gt;recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;At iwantmyname, we not only use open-source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open source.&amp;quot; But as a non-developer, truly understanding what open source stands for is a hard thing to grasp. Writers, designers, and project managers can make educated guesses, but getting non-devs involved in the world of open source can only mean good things and more well-rounded ideas for the community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, questions like the Hacker News thread above are definitely a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Does open source contribute to a more open society?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies say they love open source, but what does that actually mean? Does it mean they use a lot of software other people have written? Does it mean they like that they don&amp;#39;t have to pay for things? Or do they understand that &lt;em&gt;loving open source&lt;/em&gt; also means contributing back to the community the code came from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start again. We at iwantmyname love open source! And when I say we love open source, I mean that we&amp;#39;re always trying to work and live up to its ethos—to continuously share the things we learn, and to approach challenges with facts instead of emotion. Open-source development is all about learning and developing in the open, with people we may never meet in real life—it doesn&amp;#39;t matter to any of us what we look like, who we are, what our gender is, our race, religious beliefs, or sexual preference. It&amp;#39;s all irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how we can work together to make projects awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having lived in this environment for many years, I&amp;#39;ve started to apply this same thinking to other parts of my life. With less time these days to contribute to actual code, I make efforts to talk at conferences and user groups, and, even more importantly, to grab coffee with people who ask for feedback (or are willing to give feedback) on ideas, architectures, and random happenings. The open source community I&amp;#39;m in has become a very real community, where the people I know can discuss, in the open, critical business-related things without fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why the trust? Well, open source also teaches ethics—to be able to work and share with a loose team of contributors. You need a level of trust to have someone you&amp;#39;ve never met in person contribute code to a project, and you need the right thought technology in place to create the expectation of not breaching that trust. If that trust is breached, projects get forked, communities split up, and egos clash until everyone gets back to the hard facts and finds new ways of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we not only use open source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open-source. We actively do this by working closely with local tech incubators, hosting like-minded user groups and meetups, and sponsoring innovative events like the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensourceopensociety.com&quot;&gt;OS//OS 2015&lt;/a&gt; conference here in Wellington, which is very much aligned with our core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s exciting to be part of a brand that makes such a large impact relative to our size, and I love that we&amp;#39;ve been given the opportunity to be so deeply embedded in what&amp;#39;s going on in New Zealand and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Last chance to get your short .NZ domain before anyone else</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Time is running out, but you still have until 30 March 2015 to either register or reserve the shorter version of your .NZ domain name before anyone else. As you may know, all ‘second level’ domains like the .CO in ‘.CO.NZ’ and the .NET in ‘.NET.NZ’ are now optional, meaning you can register .NZ names with them, without them, or both (you can read more about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/&quot;&gt;anyname.nz&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that registering or reserving your corresponding .NZ name is entirely optional and will not affect your existing domain. However, it is important to remember that anyone can register domains directly under .NZ after 30 March 2015. For example, if you own the domain myperfectwebsite.CO.NZ and you do not register or reserve myperfectwebsite.NZ, anybody can buy that domain after the pre period ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that little note, have a great weekend! And, as always, please let us know if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;have any questions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.green is your new favorite color</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpiIWMWWVco&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as colors go, green is a loaded word. It stands for sustainability, political movements, and money. Kermit the Frog feels green. Sick people look a little green. Green is everywhere, and now your favorite color has an online home—&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-green&quot;&gt;.green&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what should people do with it? Here are some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Political Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries have a green party, and adding .green to a name, country, or movement slogan could be a nice touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;country.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vote.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Investment Planners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be careful not to be too forward, but if you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;making green&amp;quot; for people and either have a sense of humor or are pretty blunt, .green could be a funny domain alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investment.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saving.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sustainability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability is a buzzword that&amp;#39;s here to stay, and &amp;quot;being green&amp;quot; is something more and more people around the world are striving for. So if you&amp;#39;re looking to create a sustainability blog or a green company, .green is a perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COMPANY.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tips.green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re Kermit the Frog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;itsnoteasybeing.green &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Is Medium the billionaire’s typewriter?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html&quot;&gt;From Matthew Butterick, in an article titled, &amp;quot;The billionaire’s typewriter&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But un­like the Times, Medium pays for only a small fraction of its stories. The rest are sub­mit­ted—for free—by writ­ers like you. After a long time being elusive about its business model, Medium revealed that it plans to make money by—sur­prise!—sell­ing ad­ver­tis­ing. This means dis­play­ing ads, but also col­lect­ing and sell­ing data about read­ers and writ­ers. So Medium will extract rev­enue from every story, whether it paid for that story or not. (By the way, will that rev­enue be shared with writ­ers? Um, no.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And com­ing full cir­cle—what’s the in­dis­pens­able tool for cre­at­ing this il­lu­sion of an ed­i­to­r­ial ecosystem? The ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign. The but­ter­fly bal­lot of 2000 (de­picted in why ty­pog­ra­phy matters) proved that er­rors of ty­pog­ra­phy can have his­toric con­se­quences. Medium proves that typog­ra­phy can be used as a tool of eco­nomic lever­age and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, Medium’s main prod­uct is not a pub­lish­ing plat­form, but the pro­mo­tion of a pub­lish­ing platform. This pro­mo­tion brings read­ers and writ­ers onto the site. This, in turn, gen­er­ates the us­age data that’s valu­able to ad­ver­tis­ers. Boiled down, Medium is sim­ply mar­ket­ing in the ser­vice of more mar­ket­ing. It is not a “place for ideas.” It is a place for ad­ver­tis­ers. It is, there­fore, ut­terly superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a writer, the state of writing on the web in 2015 is not good. That&amp;#39;s not to say the tools for writing have dried up (there are more now than ever)—it&amp;#39;s just that now, instead of simply writing, I have all sorts of internal issues. Who owns my content? If I don&amp;#39;t own it, who does? Does it matter? Is &amp;quot;homogeneous design&amp;quot; something I even care about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m coming from. I have a job that pays the bills, so when I want to get some thoughts into the cloud, I&amp;#39;m not doing it for money, I&amp;#39;m doing it to be a citizen in the communities I care about. As Austin Kleon says in &lt;em&gt;Show Your Work!&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can leverage when they need it—for fellowship, feedback, or patronage.&amp;quot; For that goal, Medium, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, are perfect. Sure, everything you see on the page looks exactly the same—same typography, same basic structure—but it&amp;#39;s an instant way for a writer to connect to, and discover, the people they care about. It&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m lazy, or that I&amp;#39;m unknowingly trading my freedom to be on some Big Brother marketing platform (the billionaire&amp;#39;s typewriter), I&amp;#39;m just in a place in my life where I&amp;#39;m happy to share my thoughts on a platform someone else has created because they&amp;#39;ve removed all the barriers and invited all my friends. It&amp;#39;s a party I didn&amp;#39;t have to plan... I just had to show up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium, for example, has a CMS that anyone on the planet can use, and a design that certainly doesn&amp;#39;t insult my sensibilities. Call it minimalist, homogeneous, whatever—as a writer, I can get in, write something, and send it off to my friends without worrying if it looks good or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only issue with Medium is that its users are fairly anonymous. If I want to find a writer, I have to figure out what their Medium username is, then toss it to the back of the standard Medium URL. Too often, I&amp;#39;m just cycling through articles without ever knowing who the author is—it&amp;#39;s just a mad shuffle of big ideas and original thoughts from people I might not ever know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Medium needs is custom domains.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to be able to tell a friend to check out chrishall.pizza, not medium.com/@hashtaghall. I&amp;#39;m far too Gen X to want to be a blatant &amp;quot;corporate stooge,&amp;quot; but the Millennial in me just needs a little recognition to be appeased. Give me that level of individuality and I could care less if they leverage my writing to make some money. It wasn&amp;#39;t written to be a profit center anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the piece linked above, Matthew Butterick paints a solid picture of why someone like himself shouldn&amp;#39;t use Medium. He, like many, value things like site individuality and varied typography more than I do. And he may have a soapbox with Practical Typography that pays the bills and connects him to more people than I will probably ever know. But I don&amp;#39;t think many people want to blog full-time (it&amp;#39;s harder than many think), and they&amp;#39;d probably do anything to avoid having to make design decisions and worry about server costs. They just want to write somewhere their work will be read. And Medium lets them do that. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A call to help Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-23-vanuatu-cyclone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vanuatu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of us who live in temperate climates, it&amp;#39;s difficult to imagine
the unfolding horror of a category 5 tropical cyclone bearing down on your
home with winds exceeding 200 mph. But that was the scenario facing the
inhabitants of the far flung islands of Vanuatu recently. The tiny Pacific
Ocean island archipelago took a direct hit from Cyclone Pam, resulting in
many villages being entirely flattened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly and thankfully, the death toll as a result of the storm has been kept to a minimum, but a large section of the population has been left without food, water, and housing. Now a major relief operation is underway involving NGOs and neighbouring governments from the South Pacific region such as New Zealand and Australia. Technology is also playing a part in the recovery with power and communications providers rallying to get services running again quickly. We have seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://pacificpolicy.org/2015/03/surviving-cyclone-pam/&quot;&gt;encouraging reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that some progress is being made, against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the first time a huge cyclone has ravaged communities in the
Pacific. Typhoon Haiyan wreaked havoc across the islands of the Philippines
in 2013. You may recall our efforts to contribute during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html&quot;&gt;Haiyan relief
operation&lt;/a&gt;. With your help, we will be financially supporting UNICEF&amp;#39;s operation on the ground in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu&quot;&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt; today with an immediate donation of $6,500. We are thrilled to learn that our cash will pack twice the punch because New Zealand philanthropists Gareth and Jo Morgan have agreed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org.nz/UNICEF-New-Zealand-issues-fundraising-challenge-to-reach-82000-children-in-Vanuatu&quot;&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; the first $1 million in donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname has a longstanding policy of setting aside 10 cents from every
domain registration for charitable purposes, but with the crisis being so
great, we&amp;#39;ve dug a bit deeper to help out our neighbours in their time of need. If you want to make your own donation to the Vanuatu relief fund, you can do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The story of how Buffer bought buffer.com, and why a short .com isn&#39;t necessary for startup success</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-19-buffer-home.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buffer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.bufferapp.com/acquired-buffer-com/&quot;&gt;From Rodolphe Dutel - Buffer:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a great blogpost that Joel wrote on how to name your startup, where he mentioned that the domain name of your startup doesn’t matter. In fact, thinking about Buffer’s own domain history, we originally started out with bfffr.com, when Joel launched Buffer in late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joel went on to change it to bufferapp.com, to make things more clear and worry less about not having the exact domain of your startup’s name, “Buffer” in our case. It can be a huge time-suck in the early days of your company, where your first and foremost goal should be to hit product-market fit and building something people want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending time on acquiring a certain domain name could be a very futile exercise without a product that works. In fact, as Joel illustrates, most well-known companies all had “placeholder” domains for a long time before they got their actual name as their domain too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Square was squareup.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DropBox was getdropbox.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook was thefacebook.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram was instagr.am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter was twttr.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foursquare was playfoursquare.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary point of the post is to tell the story of how Buffer acquired buffer.com, but the real story to me is that while most of us aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;generat(ing) over $5m/year,&amp;quot; and probably don&amp;#39;t have the time or money to pay what it would cost to get a short .com in 2015, there&amp;#39;s no reason you can&amp;#39;t get to that level of success with a domain name you find less than perfect. Buffer had a $60m valuation while using bufferapp.com, and the roster of huge brands listed in the post that started with dodgy domains is pretty incredible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take anything away from this, it&amp;#39;s that the domain name you choose is only a minor piece of a very large puzzle. Before you go throwing resources at the domain aftermarket, just grab a name that fits and make your product as solid as it can possibly be. Good work attracts customers—your domain is just a sticker on the door.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On the sad stagnation of Virb</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/blog/what-happened-to-virb-after-godaddy-acquired-it&quot;&gt;From Steve Benjamins - Site Builder Report:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture at Virb began to shift after the GoDaddy acquisition. There were now new bosses and new goals— but not ones that aligned with Virb’s original vision. The 4 original Virb team members decided it was time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was clear to me that our new leadership wanted to extract as much money from our customers as possible.” Ryan Clark, Virb’s Product Manager and Creative Director at the time says. “Our new directive was simple: revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the Virb team was denied any resources. After losing the 4 original Virb team members Clark notes, “All of my requests to fill the positions disappeared in the ether of the acquisition. It seemed clear to me that GoDaddy had no intention of backing up their new goals for us with the resources to actually achieve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t so much an indictment of GoDaddy, as they clearly acquired Media Temple to better compete in the web hosting game (Virb just happened to be part of the deal), but it&amp;#39;s sad to see a once-promising platform slow to a grind. As a writer who frequently uses all-in-one platforms to get ideas on the web, I&amp;#39;ve primarily moved on to Squarespace. It&amp;#39;s fast enough, beautiful, and best of all, dead simple to use. Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll see other hosted, all-in-one solutions take up the torch though—competition in the space is what drives innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the future of Virb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallgren speculates that GoDaddy will let Virb “die a slow death and collect the money being made on it in the meantime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this most effects the 20,000 customers who still rely on Virb to provide a stable, contemporary website— unfortunately, it’s not clear how stable that future is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Mike Carson compiles the 1457 most popular .io domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/&quot;&gt;From Mike Carson:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly one year ago today I created a list of the top .io domains. At that time there were only 676 .io domains in the top 1 million sites in the world (from Alexa). In one year that number has more than doubled to 1457.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little sample (the top 10):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github.io - rank 307&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;codepen.io - rank 1372&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soup.io - rank 3161&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intercom.io - rank 3375&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;t411.io - rank 3477&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meduza.io - rank 3546&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keywordtool.io - rank 3637&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;popcorntime.io - rank 4816&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spring.io - rank 5566&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;greenhouse.io - rank 6263&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short lists are interesting. Massive lists are amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Usability is something we should all be striving for</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://melodykramer.github.io/how-betty-who-is-89-gets-her-news/&quot;&gt;From Melody Kramer:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we drank tea, I watched Betty read articles on her iPad. Her Internet was really slow. She kept accidentally clicking on the ads, or on parts of the story that she didn’t mean to click on. And she was getting a bit frustrated and worried — that by clicking on something, she was going to install malware or not be able to return to her story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 13 million people between the ages of 75 and 84 in the US. There are 5 million between the ages of 85 and 94. (census) That population will grow. At some point, it will be composed of digital natives but that’s a while away. In the interim, are there better ways to design websites for this population? Are there better ways to design the news for them? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good web entity, we&amp;#39;re always planning for the next evolution of our website. Whether we like it or not, trends change, platforms that were built for one thing get weighed down by incremental additions, and new technologies emerge (like responsive design) that change how sites move through the world. Those things are always moving targets that need to be addressed, but one factor that cannot be overlooked, no matter when your design/redesign occurs, is usability. At the end of the day, the single most important thing you can offer is an easy path from idea to completion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good example of where the internet is going. After I wrote our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/what-should-the-internet-do-with-money.html&quot;&gt;post about .money&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking through various finance websites. What I found didn&amp;#39;t really surprise me, but it&amp;#39;s worth noting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-11-fidelity-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fidelity homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Fidelity&amp;#39;s homepage. As you can see, it&amp;#39;s packed with information, but if your goal is to start an account (which, I&amp;#39;d argue, should be the goal in a logged-out state) , you have a lot to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-11-wealthfront-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wealthfront homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum is Wealthfront, an investment startup that puts usability first. Big buttons. Clear calls to action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could certainly make the argument that Fidelity&amp;#39;s website is more immediately useful, strictly from a knowledge-density perspective, but we&amp;#39;re heading in a direction, as a society, where screens are rapidly shrinking in size.  Apple recently announced their new 12&amp;quot; Macbook, which is their most technologically advanced laptop to date (not to be confused with fastest), and the only reason the screen is as big as it is is because they didn&amp;#39;t want the keyboard to be any smaller. There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; come a day, and it may come faster than we think, where an iPad/phablet-type device will be the primary device for many, and then what? Will the Fidelity content-density model hold up? Are we just going to sit around while our aging population is designed off these unusable platforms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just something to think about when you&amp;#39;re starting your next design/redesign process.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What should the internet do with its new .money?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-10-money-bowtie.png&quot; alt=&quot;Money bowtie&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is a hard thing for a lot of people to talk about, so let&amp;#39;s shift the focus a bit by putting a &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; in front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money = aghhhhhhh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.money = awesome!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should the people of the internet do with their new .money (domains... &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-money&quot;&gt;.money&lt;/a&gt; goes live tomorrow)? Let me count the ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Start the world&amp;#39;s most trusted Bitcoin blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a brilliant financier who rode Bitcoins from around $200 to nearly $1,000, then back down to $200, I can safely say that I don&amp;#39;t know right from left when it comes to Bitcoin valuations. But you know who else doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about Bitcoin valuations? The rest of the internet. And if I know anything, it&amp;#39;s that general confusion means there&amp;#39;s a gap in the market, just waiting to be filled. And really, using .money for a digital publication about digital money is magic in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Forget Bitcoins... start your own digital currency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beyond my scope, but there have to be a few iwantmynamers out there with cryptocurrency running through their veins. Seriously, if someone can build a currency around the doge meme, I think we (as in you and your friends) can band together to make something better. Just don&amp;#39;t forget the .money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Start a finance blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, if your finance blog gets big, you might have to buy (and sometimes wear) a suit or two, but that&amp;#39;s the price you have to pay when you&amp;#39;re a big time analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Become a &amp;quot;startup finance expert&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of analysts, I feel like startup financing is having a bit of a PR issue these days. I read all the time about the overabundance of money flowing through places like Silicon Valley, but I rarely read about analysts saying the opposite. Going back to my gap-that-needs-to-be-filled theory, I think there&amp;#39;s a big opportunity for someone to start an expert site telling the world that tech startups need more cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe your site could be about bootstrapped companies like iwantmyname... your call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Make your financial institution more &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; focused&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. Take your average bank, I&amp;#39;ll go with Wells Fargo for this example.  The website for Wells Fargo is wellsfargo.com—.com meaning commercial. What this says to me is that Wells Fargo is a commercial entity that wants to make money. But I don&amp;#39;t put money in the bank for them to make money, I do it so &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can make money. So why not swap the bank&amp;#39;s .com with .money and give people a little something to aspire to? wellsfargo.money sounds like a bank I could get on board with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Give your personal brand a makeover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for a little personal brand boost? Change your personal website to &lt;code&gt;YOURNAME.money&lt;/code&gt;. You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Coupon site?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the internet is in desperate need of something, it&amp;#39;s definitely more coupon sites. Retail coupon sites, online services coupon sites, coupon sites for coupon sites—the possibilities are endless! &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New feature alert - domain hacks in search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-05-domain-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;work trip&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of domains, naming is a bit like an architecture project. The domain name has to stand on its own, make sense to those who use it, and be conventional enough to attract all types of potential guests. A standard domain name is much like a standard building—the outside can be nice, but it&amp;#39;s really what&amp;#39;s inside that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; are a bit different. They&amp;#39;re the circular buildings with no conventional walls, the tiny houses that don&amp;#39;t make sense to most, the underground mud huts that only the adventurous flock to. A domain hack will likely never be the primary domain of a multinational corporation, but for those who appreciate cultural oddities, there&amp;#39;s simply nothing better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the deal. In our domain search, when you type in a word or brand, a single domain hack will now appear as the second result (if one is able to be made). It&amp;#39;s nothing Earth-shattering—just a little something for your Thursday afternoon/Friday morning (depending on what side of the international date line you&amp;#39;re on) pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Price increase alert for .INFO and .MU</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Heads up, folks. We&amp;#39;re not fond of domain extension price increases, but we have two to announce, both of which affect the registration and renewal costs for the domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;May 1, 2015 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$15.50 to $16.50 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;€11.90 to €12.90 EUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£10.90 to £11.50 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$19 to $19.90 AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 1, 2015 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mu-mauritian-domain-name-registration-for-mauritius&quot;&gt;.MU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$99 to $119 USD &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;€89 to €129 EUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$159 to $169 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£78 to £89 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$119 to $169 AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the price increases, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Trustworthiness as a factor in Google rankings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530102.600-google-wants-to-rank-websites-based-on-facts-not-links.html#.VPSuQUIylBW&quot;&gt;From Hal Hodson - New Scientist:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google research team is adapting that model to measure the trustworthiness of a page, rather than its reputation across the web. Instead of counting incoming links, the system – which is not yet live – counts the number of incorrect facts within a page. &amp;quot;A source that has few false facts is considered to be trustworthy,&amp;quot; says the team (arxiv.org/abs/1502.03519v1). The score they compute for each page is its Knowledge-Based Trust score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software works by tapping into the Knowledge Vault, the vast store of facts that Google has pulled off the internet. Facts the web unanimously agrees on are considered a reasonable proxy for truth. Web pages that contain contradictory information are bumped down the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much time and effort these days goes into search engine optimization (SEO), but every time I see an article like this, I see a day in the far-off future where all the &amp;quot;tips and tricks&amp;quot; will be replaced by variations of a single question—is your website helping the world or hurting it?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Leonard Nimoy&#39;s final tweet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/27/8121021/leonard-nimoy-spock-live-long-and-prosper&quot;&gt;From Bryan Bishop - The Verge:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it should go without saying that the sense of someone we get from their acting and public appearances often bears little resemblance to who they actually are. But what is undeniable is the emotional impact their work has on us. And for the millions of people, like myself, that grew up with Leonard Nimoy, those are the memories that we will carry with us throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a sentiment that Nimoy himself reflected upon on Twitter this past Sunday, in his very last post. &amp;quot;A life is like a garden,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain hacks and the new generic top-level domains</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain hacks aren&amp;#39;t for the feint of heart. They disrupt the status quo of website naming, they&amp;#39;re often hard to say out loud, and countless online guides have been written warning people not to get too clever with their domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...I&amp;#39;m just going to come out and say it...I love a good domain hack. They&amp;#39;re counterculture without being overly brazen and they stick in my head forever (despite being hard to say sometimes). And with hundreds of new domain extensions to choose from with the launch of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, the domain hack possibilities are practically endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into it, let&amp;#39;s set a working definition for what a domain hack is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain hack - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or brand names out of domain names, like bit.ly (brand name) or iwantmyna.me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now clearly, with these new gTLDs running around, the definition of domain hack is in a bit of flux. Is a domain like chess.club a domain hack? I&amp;#39;d argue that it&amp;#39;s not, unless your brand name is ChessClub. If every gTLD that makes a phrase is considered a domain hack, then the term itself has been diluted beyond comprehension. We just can&amp;#39;t have that! So... no phrases for domain hacks, just words and brand names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these boundaries in mind, let&amp;#39;s find some good gTLD domain hack possibilities (I&amp;#39;m not checking each for availability... this is really just to get your mind going).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ra.bid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifi.city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ac.company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dis.credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;super.fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bl.ink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never.land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hyper.link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;de.parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bo.red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at.tax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net.work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many good options! Again, domain hacks are definitely for the feint of heart, but if you find yourself hopelessly attracted to clever domain/TLD combinations, we&amp;#39;re right in the middle of a domain hack renaissance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you need any help finding a killer domain hack, look no further than the trusty &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordfind.com/#words&quot;&gt;Scrabble Word Finder&lt;/a&gt; (under advanced options, you can specifically ask for words that end with any combination of letters). Also, if you have a specific word in mind, our friends over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainr.com&quot;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt; have the perfect domain search for the task—it takes any word you put in and shoots back a handful of awesome options, including any combination of domain hacks available (I typed in bored and got back bo.red &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bo.re/d... both taken already, but still amazing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy domain hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Question. What extension should I use? Answer. .QA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With all the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; coming out, sometimes we forget to celebrate the other domains we add to the site. Just last week, we added a wonderful new country code top-level domain (ccTLD), .QA, to the list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.QA is the domain extension for Qatar, located on the Arabian Peninsula between Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Businesses and individuals in Qatar will certainly use the extension to establish a local presence, but for non-Qataris, .QA is the perfect acronym—&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;uality &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ssurance and &lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;uestions and &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nswers—for a host of professional websites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to start a related site, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/qa-qatari-domain-name-registration-for-qatar&quot;&gt;.QA page&lt;/a&gt; for current pricing and transfer information.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The simple guide to finding the right domain name for your podcast</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-20-podcast.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;podcast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasts seem to be getting more and more popular by the week, with big shows and big names finally getting the mainstream media attention they deserve. But one of the best things about podcasting is that it can be done by anyone. There aren&amp;#39;t any expensive broadcasting rights or legal hurdles to deal with—all you have to do is get a mic, learn how to use some basic audio software (free options like Garageband are readily available), and find a reliable platform to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/&quot;&gt;host your show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing that trips up many budding podcasters is the domain name. For the same reasons naming anything is hard, naming and finding a domain name for a podcast is a tricky balance between science and intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;General naming tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into top-level domains (TLDs), let&amp;#39;s dive into some basic naming tips for your podcast. Here are a few rules to live by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to pick a name that&amp;#39;s too long or too hard to spell. The last thing you want is for your show to be hard to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to name your brand something that could be confused with a bigger, more well-known brand. A quick check is to type the name in Google—if you find a brand with an entire page full of search content, you&amp;#39;ll be fighting an uphill battle (not to mention potential legal issues).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your show begins with &amp;quot;The&amp;quot;, it may be wise to get two domains—one with &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; and one without. For example, if your show is The Domain Podcast, try registering thedomainpodcast.com and domainpodcast.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-letter characters like dashes and numbers are fairly rare online, and may confuse people trying to find your show. Only use them when it&amp;#39;s absolutely necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Domain extensions from iTunes&amp;#39; US top-50 podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Excluding shows that don&amp;#39;t have their own sites due to being on larger networks, like Invisibilia with http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; - freakonomics.com, missedinhistory.com, stuffyoushouldknow.com, lightroomkillertips.com, wtfpod.com, dancarlin.com, commonplacebooks.com, thisiscriminal.com, fourhourworkweek.com, daveramsey.com, nerdist.com, thetruthpodcast.com, smartpassiveincome.com, adamcarolla.com, sciencefriday.com, billburr.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt; - serialpodcast.org, thisamericanlife.org, radiolab.org, themoth.org, howtodoeverything.org, 99percentinvisible.org, onbeing.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; - podcasts.joerogan.net, startalkradio.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; - howtostartastartup.co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt; - everydayfinance.info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s interesting about podcasts is that although they&amp;#39;re seen as a fairly new phenomenon, they&amp;#39;ve been around for quite some time now, and many of the most popular shows are linked to either &amp;quot;old-school media&amp;quot; (NPR/various TV networks) or sites that represent established non-podcast entities (like Freakonomics Radio, which started as a book, and The Moth, which organizes live storytelling events). Given the abundance of pre-internet roots, it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me to see so many .COMs, .ORGs, and .NETs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like the rest of the internet, good names in these domain extensions are increasingly hard to come by. If you&amp;#39;re looking for some alternative domain extensions, here are some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternative domain extensions for podcast websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-audio&quot;&gt;.audio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-community&quot;&gt;.community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-digital&quot;&gt;.digital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert&quot;&gt;.expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-media&quot;&gt;.media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&quot;&gt;.press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-report&quot;&gt;.report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&quot;&gt;.today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-radio&quot;&gt;.radio&lt;/a&gt; (launch date TBD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt; (popularly used by Overcast, one of the more popular podcast players for the iPhone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; (still a very popular extension for startups and tech projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to use descriptive extensions for your brand. Here are some industry specific top-level domains (TLDs) that could work quite well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-academy&quot;&gt;.academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&quot;&gt;.beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-build&quot;&gt;.build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-business&quot;&gt;.business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&quot;&gt;.coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-events&quot;&gt;.events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-futbol&quot;&gt;.futbol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-hiphop&quot;&gt;.hiphop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-reviews&quot;&gt;.reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-reviews&quot;&gt;.tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-zone&quot;&gt;.zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) open up such a huge world of naming options for everyone. If you find one you like, use it! Just remember that podcast discovery is unlike typical website discovery. If your show is good, fans will probably find your podcast on platforms like iTunes or Stitcher first, then attempt to find your website later after hearing a few episodes. Given that discovery path, your biggest concern should be how sticky your domain sounds when you inevitably say it at the end of each episode. Before you register a domain, say it out loud to a few of your friends—if it sounds awkward, long, or tricky to spell, you&amp;#39;re probably going to lose traffic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you ever get stuck, try a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza&quot;&gt;.pizza&lt;/a&gt; domain. Nine out of ten scientists agree that it&amp;#39;s impossible to forget domains that end in .pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A big WHOIS privacy update</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-17-superhero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Superhero&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy is rightly a huge concern for many people, and we&amp;#39;re actively updating our platform to keep as much of your information off the Internet as we can. On the domain front, one of the easiest ways to keep your identity hidden is to use a WHOIS privacy service, which basically eliminates your domain registration information (name, address, phone number, etc.) from the WHOIS record altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, we&amp;#39;ve used our own WHOIS privacy service, which masked phone numbers and addresses, but still left names and email addresses in the WHOIS public record. For many, this worked fine, but we&amp;#39;ve received a number of requests for a more robust solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new WHOIS privacy in place, all personal information, including names and email addresses, will now be masked. With the service turned on, you are still the legal owner (registrant) of the domain name, and have full control should you wish to update the registrant details, change the owner, or transfer it to another registrar, but a WHOIS lookup will show none of your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that WHOIS privacy is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; added to domains automatically (it&amp;#39;s entirely optional), but you can add the service (for free) from your domain&amp;#39;s WHOIS update page under &lt;strong&gt;Domains &amp;gt; yourdomain.com &amp;gt; Domain owner &amp;gt; enable privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; If you currently have our old WHOIS privacy service in place, you can update to the new full masking service by clicking &lt;strong&gt;disable privacy&lt;/strong&gt; in your dashboard to remove the old service, let the page refresh, then click &lt;strong&gt;enable privacy&lt;/strong&gt; to add the new WHO privacy service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that WHOIS privacy isn&amp;#39;t available for all domain extensions (WHOIS privacy availability is determined by the individual registries). Currently, you can use it with the following extensions (this list is constantly growing as we add new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), so please refer to our knowledge base for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425-do-you-offer-a-whois-privacy-service-&quot;&gt;updated list&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Found reviews - Fastmail, the &quot;slickest web interface currently available&quot;</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-13-fastmail.png&quot; alt=&quot;FastMail&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lemery.io/review-fastmail&quot;&gt;From Sebastian Lemery:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pay $40 a year for FastMail. That&amp;#39;s $3.33 a month for something I use every day, multiple times an hour. Because I pay for this product, I get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer service oriented towards my happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A company focused on me, the customer, instead of advertisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features targeting users, not advertisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough: pay for what you use. I love that I pay Fastmail to handle my email. I enjoy knowing their engineers are making money, improving the app I thoroughly enjoy using. When you don&amp;#39;t pay for software, you create a void that must be filled by either selling your data or catering a product to advertisers. Even if you are indifferent, it still creates an environment where engineers are potentially assigned to features that appease advertisers over users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re big fans of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt; here at iwantmyname, and this review seems pretty dead-on—it&amp;#39;s fast, reliable, and always customer-focused. If you&amp;#39;re on the market for a new email service, check FastMail out (also, using our Marketplace, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain&quot;&gt;add it to your domain&lt;/a&gt; in a snap). &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - QuickMVP, the easiest way to test your next big idea</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-12-quickmvp.png&quot; alt=&quot;5-Minute Technique&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you come up with a big idea, spent the money, time, and effort needed to get it going, only to watch it flame out after a few months due to a lack of traction. It&amp;#39;s hard to know how successful an idea will be before launch, but and easy way to find out is with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/marketing/quickmvp&quot;&gt;QuickMVP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QuickMVP&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;5-Minute Technique&amp;quot; is just about as simple as it sounds. You create a quick landing page that tests the demand for your idea, set up some Google Ads with their built-in ad creator to spread the word, then sit back and see what happens. It sounds ridiculously easy, but the methodology has been used successfully by many of today&amp;#39;s brightest entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little case study from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://quickmvp.tumblr.com/post/88837748550/validating-an-ny-times-best-selling-title-with&quot;&gt;QuickMVP blog&lt;/a&gt; about Tim Ferriss&amp;#39; naming of The 4-Hour Workweek:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bid on keywords related to the book’s content such as ‘401k’ and ‘language learning’: when those keywords formed part of someone’s search on Google the title popped up as a headline and the advertisement text would be the subtitle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferriss was interested to see which of the advertisements would be clicked on most, knowing that he needed his title to compete with over 200,000 books published in the US each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the week, for less than $200 Tim discovered that “The 4-Hour Workweek” had by far the best click-through rate. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you&amp;#39;re in the testing stage of a big idea, keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://quickmvp.com&quot;&gt;QuickMVP&lt;/a&gt; in mind—it&amp;#39;s a bit of a no-brainer. The process isn&amp;#39;t quite free, but anything beats throwing money at an idea that might not be market-ready.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>4 tools for remembering your passwords... a year later</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-11-vault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vault&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve worked hard over the past half-decade making domain registration as easy as possible, but one pain point we often encounter is password memorization. The vast majority of our customers simply don&amp;#39;t need to interact with us very often, and what seems like a strong, easily remembered password could be completely alien when domain renewals come around a year later. But there are solutions for this very problem—all you need is a solid password manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an intro to password managers from &lt;a href=&quot;The%20paranoid%20guide%20to%20digital%20security&quot;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is straightforward: You sign up for a service that generates and stores a unique, strong password for each of the websites where you need log-in credentials. You can do that yourself if you have a savant-like memory for numbers, but in all likelihood you don’t. Then, you just need to remember one, excellent password in order to access the service. Yes, you may ask, but what if the password manager gets hacked? Not to worry, says Chris Soghoian. “Password managers encrypt their data, so these services are safe. And, ultimately, in 2015 it’s not a good idea to use the same password for more than one website. That effectively means that you have to outsource the task.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1Password&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-11-one-password.png&quot; alt=&quot;1Password&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that acts as a vault for all your passwords, secured by a single password of your creation. Basically, using a browser extension (available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera), app, or smartphone app, you can open your vault with your master password and have instant access to all the passwords you&amp;#39;ve created, on any device you happen to be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little excerpt from an extremely in-depth piece by the Sweet Setup, titled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-password-manager-and-why-you-need-one/&quot;&gt;The best password manager (and why you need one) - 1Password&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, 1Password is the best app for managing your passwords because it does the best job of taking hold of our slippery digital identity, all the myriad digital bits of ourselves we use to prove who we are, and helps ease the friction of our travels through the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another glowing review from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macstories.net/reviews/1password-4-for-mac-review/&quot;&gt;MacStories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time a new version of 1Password comes out, I feel like repeating myself: if you’re serious about your secure data and web logins, you need 1Password. While it’s a great thing that Apple will be providing native options for increased password security and form-filling with iCloud Keychain, my recommendation still goes to 1Password if you’re looking for a dedicated app with more and better options aimed at managing your passwords, login details, credit card information, software licenses, and more. iCloud Keychain is meant for Safari, whereas 1Password is system-wide, powered by great customizable menus with keyboard shortcuts, and goes beyond web logins to let you encrypt and protect just about anything. I can’t work without 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;LastPass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-11-lastpass.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LastPass&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good password manager is &lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, which works basically the same way 1Password does, but with a few less bells and whistles (although LastPass has been making huge strides), and a cheaper price (there&amp;#39;s a free option!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a bit from PC Mag&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426798,00.asp&quot;&gt;LastPass 3.0 review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing all of your passwords in a single, secure password manager means you can use a different, strong password for every site, without worrying that you&amp;#39;ll forget. It also means that a successful attack on your password stash could give a hacker access to every one of your secure sites. If that thought worries you, the free LastPass 3.0 is just what you need. Your data is stored online in encrypted form that even the company can&amp;#39;t read, and it&amp;#39;s encrypted going to and from your PCs. You can protect your LastPass data with more different kinds of two-factor authentication than any other password manager I&amp;#39;ve encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dashlane&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-11-dashlane.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dashlane&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dashlane.com&quot;&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to the other password managers on the market (if you want details, David Pogue wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/technology/personaltech/too-many-passwords-and-no-way-to-remember-them-until-now.html&quot;&gt;very positive review&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times, as did &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/12/09/dashlanes-automatic-password-changer-makes-precious-accounts-less-hackable/&quot;&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt; in late 2014), but a new feature dropped in December that makes it extremely enticing. Here&amp;#39;s the description from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7357251/dashlane-can-now-change-all-your-passwords-with-a-single-click-and&quot;&gt;the Verge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashlane, the subscription-based password management service, is introducing a feature today that ought to become standard in every product like it: the ability to change all your passwords with a single click, including accounts with two-factor authentication enabled. The feature will work with about 75 major websites at launch, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, PayPal, Pinterest, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Password Changer, as the feature is called, is made possible by Dashlane’s acquisition of PassOmatic, a New York startup that developed the core technology. For now, it works on desktop versions of Dashlane for PC and Mac, though the company is working on a mobile version. Dashlane now includes a big green &amp;quot;change all passwords&amp;quot; button; click it, and it will replace your existing passwords with ones that are unique and randomly generated. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, a pop-up will ask you for a code or for the answer to a security question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Safari Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid the master password thing and just want a simple password storage system, the Safari Password Manager is a pretty nice tool. Basically, when you&amp;#39;re setting up an account online, Safari can auto-generate and save a secure password that will sync via iCloud Keychain for you to use on any device. It&amp;#39;s incredibly easy, but for some, it might be too easy. Here&amp;#39;s a specific pain-point, from the pro-1Password &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-password-manager-and-why-you-need-one/&quot;&gt;Sweet Setup&lt;/a&gt; article above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different people also have different levels of comfort with iCloud Keychain. I, for one, don’t actually love the frictionless experience. I want to be intentional about how I use my passwords and my credit card information, and I like how 1Password makes me conscious of when I’m using those things. I also like how I have more control over access to my information on my devices. I can require a login to 1Password after not using it for even a few minutes. I also like that if my daughter is using my iPad, she can’t easily hop over to Zappos and buy herself a new pair of shoes with my credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, practically anything is better than using the same passwords for all your online accounts (or forgetting your clever creations after a week), and without the help of a password manager, that&amp;#39;s almost always what happens. So before you create yet another password you&amp;#39;ll forget, do a little comparison shopping and leave the memorization to the machines. It&amp;#39;ll change your online life forever.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - PodBean, the podcast platform with its own network</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-10-podbean-best-of.png&quot; alt=&quot;Best of&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &amp;quot;New in the Marketplace&amp;quot; blog series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting challenges podcasters face is exposure, and most of the podcast hosting platforms on the market don’t provide much in terms of built-in audiences. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/podbean&quot;&gt;PodBean&lt;/a&gt; does, and their built-in podcast marketplace has more than 500,000 independent podcasts covering any category you could ever want. And on top of that, PodBean gives you the tools you need to create customizable websites that can instantly ship shows off to all the biggest podcatchers, with options like unlimited bandwidth and storage, a simple platform for creating premium content, and advertising options via third-party networks for additional monetization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-10-podbean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PodBean&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing starts at $3/mo, so if you’re looking for a podcast host that does it all, be sure to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podbean.com&quot;&gt;PodBean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The February domain discounts, including .CLUB, .CM, and .IO</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-06-groundhog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Phil&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still summer in NZ, but with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil&quot;&gt;Punxsutawney Phil&lt;/a&gt; seeing his shadow in on Feb. 2, the US and Canada will have winter chills for at least six more weeks—and chilly bones deserve especially good domain discounts. So this month, .CLUB, one of our most popular new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), is on sale, and we&amp;#39;re hoping to see a bunch of new clubs (Summer.club? Winter.club?) pop up all around the world. And if clubs aren&amp;#39;t your thing, we have 12 other extensions set at great prices.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - Bigcommerce, for beautiful online stores</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-05-bigcommerce-main.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bigcommerce&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, e-commerce was the first big draw of the internet. You could go online, pick out things like clothing or electronics, then have the items shipped directly to your house. It was the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first e-commerce sites really weren&amp;#39;t very sophisticated. They were slow, complicated, and pretty walled off from the rest of the internet. Compare that to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/bigcommerce&quot;&gt;Bigcommerce&lt;/a&gt; and...well, there really isn&amp;#39;t any comparison. With Bigcommerce, you get custom websites, secure carts, digital product catalogs, marketing tools, reporting, mobile-optimized shopping, etc., etc. And their online stores can literally be created by business owners who have no coding or design capabilities whatsoever. It&amp;#39;s truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what the web is saying about Bigcommerce:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiadishman/2014/03/19/why-bigcommerce-says-its-ready-to-take-on-amazon-web-services-to-help-retailers/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Stringfellow says that Bigcommerce’s biggest competitive advantage is that it allows any small retailer to scale from its first sale into the millions. “On average a Bigcommerce client generates nearly twice as much revenue as our nearest competitor,” he underscores. Stringfellow also notes that merchants can choose the look and feel of their store via a marketplace of responsive themes. “We are also consistently optimizing the merchant’s store management interface, the website and all client interfaces to ensure we present the most optimal experience.”&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2727-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-bigcommerce&quot;&gt;Signal v. Noise&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;That desire led to BigCommerce, which is now approaching 10,000 paying customers. According to Harper, the company has grown 480% over the last 4 years and is the fastest growing ecommerce platform in the world. It was ranked the 14th fastest growing software company (#633 overall) on the Inc 5,000 list for 2010 and it now has 50 employees spread between its Sydney, Australia and Austin, Texas offices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/bigcommerce-raises-40m-from-steve-cases-revolution-growth-to-help-smbs-manage-e-commerce/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;As founders Eddie Machaalani and Mitchell Harper explain, for as little as $25 a month merchants can set up a storefront and make their first sale within 48 hours. As ecommerce continues to grow in an Amazon-dominated world, Bigcommerce wants to be the layer for SMBs to operate a various sales channels. So a merchant could sell on Amazon, and eBay but have Bigcommerce be the platform from which they sell these goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bigcommerce is the big equalizer,” Case said of the company. “Now every entrepreneur can have Amazon-like e-commerce capabilities, in hours – not months or years.”&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re serious about creating a world class e-commerce experience, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigcommerce.com/v18/&quot;&gt;Bigcommerce&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to start. At the time of writing, plans start at $29.95/mo ($26.96/mo if paid annually), and there&amp;#39;s a 15-day free trial to see if the platform is right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It takes two to make a thing go right - setting up a website with your domain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually getting your own website with your own domain name online can be a bit like exploring a foreign land. Navigating uncharted territory, trying to decipher unfamiliar language. Creating a web presence is not for the weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we&amp;#39;ve put a lot of work into trying to make that process as painless as possible. And now, with designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/say-hi-to-the-newest-iwantmynamer-kevin-layshock.html&quot;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; on board, we&amp;#39;re hoping to make even greater strides in user experience friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing some people still sometimes struggle with, though, is just how to get a website up and running. If only it all happened by magic as soon as your domain was registered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding web hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, you can think of the process a bit like setting up a piece of electronics equipment. The cable needs to be plugged into the machine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; into an electrical outlet. Your domain name needs to be connected to a web platform in our system &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the system of your hosting service platform. When setting up your website, you can do these steps in whatever order you choose. I&amp;#39;ll explain in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All websites need a host, somewhere to &amp;quot;live&amp;quot;. Think of your domain name as the address of your house, and the hosting as the actual house the address refers to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we focus on domains and DNS management, so we don&amp;#39;t offer hosting. However, we want it to be as easy as possible for you to set up hosting with whatever provider you choose. That can be done a couple of different ways, depending on your hosting choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your site with a service platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-03-apps.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apps&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sign up with a service that provides a platform: this includes web hosting &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the software to create and display your website and its contents. Examples of this include Squarespace, Big Cartel, Zenfolio, or Tumblr. In those cases, you have an account with the service, and set up and make changes to your website in that account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those platforms make it incredibly easy to set up great-looking sites with little technical know-how. Click on preferred colours, drag and drop how you want things to look, and you&amp;#39;re all set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you pay just to have an account, sometimes the services are free. Or they can be free for a basic account, and then you pay to scale up the features and flexibility: a &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the services in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;our one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt; are that kind. They provide the hosting and platform for your blog, portfolio, online store, etc. Clicking that green &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; button adds DNS records for your domain in your iwantmyname dashboard. Those DNS records connect your domain name to your account and site with the service platform. That&amp;#39;s half the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verifying your domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some services require you to verify your domain ownership in their system for security purposes. In those cases you&amp;#39;ll likely have to add another DNS record that contains a unique code, which the service checks for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the code from the other service (Squarespace and Google Apps are good examples) and add a CNAME or or TXT record containing the code, then save the new settings. Where we can, we ask you for that code in our one-click setup, and add that extra record for you. The screenshot below shows the one-click setup for Squarespace. (You can see an example of instructions on how to get the verification code &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.squarespace.com/guides/domain-mapping-with-iwantmyname&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-03-squarespace-verification.png&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace verification&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the settings have some time to propagate around the Internet (a few hours is plenty of time, usually), you can verify ownership in your account with the platform service. Often you can do this by just entering your domain name in your account there and clicking a button. These services generally have excellent documentation to explain where and how to complete that. But if you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re happy to help, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verification is often the biggest part of setting up your domain with the other service. When verification isn&amp;#39;t needed, it&amp;#39;s often as simple as logging in to your account on that platform, adding your domain name in your account, and saving the new settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where possible, when you finish setting up the DNS records you need in our system, we try to send you to the other site to complete the setup there, too. Once setup is done on both ends and the new settings have time to propagate around the Internet — voila! — you have your new website! (If there&amp;#39;s a snag, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re here to help&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your site with third-party hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web hosting can also be provided by a third-party hosting service, on which your website&amp;#39;s files reside. Those services generally only provide hosting, and not the software to create your website or email accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;Our recommended hosting partners are Bluehost and Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, which provide only the hosting. Then you can use whatever software and services you like. WordPress is also a popular option, though it provides both the hosting and the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use external web hosting, you connect your domain to the hosting account by adding their nameservers in your iwantmyname dashboard. Using external nameservers is kind of like having your mail forwarded after you move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-03-nameserver-options.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nameservers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your iwantmyname account dashboard, on the nameserver update page, there&amp;#39;s a drop-down list of many popular hosting providers. Clicking on the one with which you have an account will automatically fill in their nameservers. Then you just have to save the new settings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can get the nameservers from your hosting company (or set up your own, if you&amp;#39;re techy) and add them. They often look something like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns1.domainhosting.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns2.domainhosting.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use external web hosting, there is one important thing to remember, which is that you then have to set up any DNS records in your web hosting account, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in your iwantmyname account. Our DNS management dashboard can only work when our nameservers are in place. If there&amp;#39;s any trouble with the DNS records, we can&amp;#39;t access or see them in your hosting account, so you&amp;#39;d need to ask your hosting provider for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting up your website with a domain name you have registered with us, you will only have to set things up in one of these two ways: either adding DNS records to a service platform, or updating nameservers for an external web hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to set up more than one service platform in your iwantmyname account. For example, if you would like to set up a website and email accounts. Or have an online store and a blog. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;Feel free to get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions about how to do any of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of February, including .work, .delivery, and .yoga</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-02-02-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;work&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches have gotten off to a bit of a slow start in 2015, but the overall stats are looking more impressive by the day. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntldstats.com&quot;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are now 4,121,213 new gTLDs registered (a nearly 400,000 jump from Jan 1), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;so many options to choose from&lt;/a&gt;—there&amp;#39;s literally never been a better time than today to get a unique domain with your brand name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, we have eight new domain extensions, including .yoga, .work, and .energy. It&amp;#39;s hard to predict individual TLD popularity because of the abundant options available, but some industry specific options (like .delivery for home delivery startups) have done pretty well in niche markets. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - Simplecast, podcast hosting made easy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-30-simplecast.png&quot; alt=&quot;Simplecast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &amp;quot;New in the Marketplace&amp;quot; blog series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentleman, podcasts are a thing now, and real people are listening to them. What was once a tiny community of hobbyists and public radio hosts is now an industry with hit shows being covered by national publications. But what makes podcasting magic is that there&amp;#39;s virtually nothing stopping you from starting your own show and building an audience—all you need is a half-decent mic, a quiet room, and some simple editing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest hangup I&amp;#39;ve seen lately though is hosting. Once you create your show and record some episodes, how do you get them online (and then to podcatchers like iTunes, Stitcher, and Overcast)? Well, if you&amp;#39;re looking for a hassle-free solution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast&quot;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; just might be perfect. With Simplecast, you get unlimited storage and a one-step file importer to build clean sites (using templates or your own design), collaboration tools to facilitate your future team (you know, for when you get big), and easy-to-understand metrics for seeing how you&amp;#39;re doing. It&amp;#39;s all pretty painless, giving you all the energy you need to post your show on a consistent schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-30-simplecast-analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not usually one to read too much into &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecast.fm/about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page copy, but the message of simplicity on the Simplecast site really rings true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story behind Simplecast is as simple as the platform itself…we needed it. After publishing multiple podcasts, the same issues kept popping up and we kept saying to ourselves that publishing podcasts had to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasting is still pretty young as a platform and we hope to keep building a solid product that makes it easier for all of us. We asked ourselves what we would want in a podcasting platform and it was simple: try it out for free, don&amp;#39;t limit bandwidth, manage everything in one place, get only the stats we need, allow multiple podcasts per account, and have a player that is easy to use and distribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simplecast.fm&quot;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; has a 14-day free trial, then is $12/mo (or $120/yr). Now I know there are a few free solutions out there for podcast hosting, but you often get what you pay for. Here&amp;#39;s a tweet I often refer to from Merlin Mann (podcast extraordinaire):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just went to listen to a podcast hosted on Soundcloud and it added an extra-extra preroll ad.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Guys. Hosting&amp;#39;s cheap. Have a little dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/549423128355426304&quot;&gt;December 29, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the &amp;quot;New in the Marketplace&amp;quot; blog series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like every website builder has some sort of drag-and-drop feature these days, but the functionality is never quite what you think it will be. There are often limitations, and the dragging and dropping is often limited to template locations and conventional ideas. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/webflow&quot;&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt; though, you really can tinker to your heart’s desire—it’s almost like a modern rethinking of Dreamweaver, but fully hosted and not tied to a Creative Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what others are saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/11/responsive-website-builder-webflow-raises-1-5-million-from-khosla-tim-draper-others/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Today, Webflow lets designers build responsive websites using a drag-and-drop website builder with an intuitive interface in order to customize their site with common web elements, like sliders, maps, buttons, divs, videos, social widgets, and more. On the backend, Webflow generates W3C-compliant HTML5 and CSS3 code. There aren’t many competitors for a service like this, beyond to some extent, Bootstrap, Foundation or Adobe’s Edge Reflow – but those require more a more advanced skill set to use.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/05/designing-responsive-websites-browser-webflow/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Webflow is a tool targeted at designers who are looking for an alternative to Photoshop and Fireworks for responsive web design. It’s not an all-encompassing solution for creating websites — at least not yet — but by enabling me to focus on layout, interaction and content behavior without having to code, it sped up our team’s design phase immensely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2014/05/08/webflow-lets-designers-create-websites-without-learning-to-code/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Webflow’s vision is to do the same thing for web design as tools like Blogger and WordPress did for personal publishing. Those tools completely took down technical barriers (previously you had to be a master of HTML and FTP to get your thoughts online) and opened up the world of publishing to orders of a magnitude of more people, and in the process transformed the web. Similarly, web design currently requires designers to be masters of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the change is inevitable and Webflow plans to lead the charge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-29-webflow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Webflow&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a designer who knows what you want, but doesn’t have the time to get your hands too dirty in the dev world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webflow.com&quot;&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt; just might be your next killer tool. Best of all, the platform has a free tier to get started on, and a ton (seriously, a lot) of short &lt;a href=&quot;http://tutorials.webflow.com&quot;&gt;tutorial videos&lt;/a&gt; to help you learn the platform. Give it a go, we think you&amp;#39;ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New in the Marketplace - Muut, a reimagined forum/commenting platform</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-28-muut-acion.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Muut Action&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the New in the Marketplace blog series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a blog is quite the endeavor. It’s a commitment to consistent writing, creative thinking, and unending doubt as to whether or not you’re hitting your goals. But one think blog creators often overlook is the means for audiences to have conversations around your work. Too often, the commenting/forum tools used look like they were created in the late 90s, and often function in ways that discourage natural thought processes—and that’s something &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/muut&quot;&gt;Muut&lt;/a&gt; is trying to change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://muut.com/manifesto/&quot;&gt;Muut Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; (I always like a good manifesto):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muut is a radically different discussion platform that can be embedded on any website. It is unencumbered by the weight of unnecessary features and distractions, and places the conversation back to the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clean user interface, persistent content and a deep integration to the site will allow a more natural and meaningful discussion to take place, and enable people to focus on topics they care about. It’s a lightweight, super fast, and responsive platform that places minimal strain on data bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re on an important mission. A proper forums and commenting system will increase traffic on any given website, and the audience will stay longer. There is no sane reason not to have forums or commenting on a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-28-forum-placement.png&quot; alt=&quot;muut placement options&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Muut is a clean, embeddable, customizable (no iframes), crawlable, responsive, realtime, worry-free conversation platform for your site. And best of all, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://muut.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;try it out&lt;/a&gt; (for an unlimited amount of time, with unlimited bandwidth, users, and data… just a few limited features) for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here&amp;#39;s a little something extra if you&amp;#39;re looking to sign up. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3194335-12097132&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and enter promo code MUUT20 by March 1, 2015 to get 20% off.)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why does iwantmyname need a monthly newsletter?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&amp;#39;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a challenge. Digital startups today are looking to capture global audiences with smaller staffs, more competition, and leaner margins than the analog brands of yore. For example, here at iwantmyname, our current marketing/communications goal is to reach the entirety of the English-speaking world (and beyond) with 11 people and no giant marketing budget speak of. Basically, we&amp;#39;ve almost exclusively leveraged word-of-mouth to reach customers/visitors in 234 countries (Google Analytics even says we got a visit from N. Korea?)...something we&amp;#39;re extremely proud of, but it&amp;#39;s a constant grind to spread our message of simplicity even further—in a sincere way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sincerity in brand messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m just a naive between-Millennial-and-Gen-Xer (Xennial?), but I often look at advertising as an insincere gesture. When I see display ads, I often think of them as giant billboards trying to subliminally make me like things (I don’t like you, but that cheeseburger looks delicious!). Social marketing is often the same—companies tweet mildly funny tidbits to their followers, hoping for some sort of delightful, friendly response. If their posts were personal notes or direct messages, they’d be charming, but it’s hard to be charmed by a message directed at no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just so much noise. 10 tweets a day from each brand, three Facebook posts, display ads, news articles, sponsorships, appearances. As a consumer, I’m not looking for radio silence, I’m just yearning for a way to turn it off most of the week. I like to see innovation and ideas and compatible company cultures, but I don’t have the time or mental capacity to keep up with fifteen brands shouting at me everywhere I go. None of us do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as an iwantmyname brand ambassador, I feel like the responsible thing to do is to help create a way to deliver our thoughts and innovations without filling people&amp;#39;s lives with even more noise—to compress all the clutter into one manageable chunk. In 2015, I really think this is the best way to follow brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sign up for the monthly newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most days we (along with so many other brands) publish blog posts, then do some connecting social posts—but it would be crazy to expect anyone to pay attention on a daily basis. If you follow the iwantmyname blog daily, as my mom would say, bless your heart. But let’s be honest…if you’re not a keeping up with the industry on a professional or semi-professional basis, you shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be thinking about domains all the time. We designed iwantmyname to be the simplest domain registrar on the internet because we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; want people to have to regularly think about our end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have some interesting ideas though, and we regularly highlight features and give suggestions that can make lives easier. For example, if you’re looking to host a podcast, we recently added &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast&quot;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; to our available plugins. It’s a really neat platform—something we think you should know about. And we often post about new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; coming out, which could inspire you to start the next great website. We’re also pretty big on startup culture, so we often write about new tools and thought technologies we find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want some more of the above, or if you just want to know if our brand aligns with your ideals and priorities, the best/least-intrusive option is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;sign up for our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, it’s yet another thing  to sign up for, but in a way it sets you free. After you sign up, you can be certain we’ll deliver you our latest thoughts in one easily deletable email (seriously, one click and it’s gone), and after that, you can go back to thinking about whatever it is you should be thinking about—like your job, your family, or your hobby du jour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, for more instant coverage, our social platforms (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;) work great. Our general social strategy is to only spread thoughts—and very few good thoughts can be condensed to 140 characters—so 1-3 times a day we post links to blogs we’ve written, plus the occasional update, and that’s about it. If you see something you find interesting, click on it, but if you don’t, don&amp;#39;t sweat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stats also seem to support a monthly newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine it’s pretty clear by now that I prefer newsletters as the content driver for most brands, but the stats seem to support that thinking as well. If you’ve been an iwantmyname customer for a while, you’ve probably seen the yearly newsletter we send to remind people of our existence (we send it to every customer). Here are some stats from the end-of-2014 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent to 99,960 mailboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29.2% open rate (vs. the 14.7 industry average, according to MailChimp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most clicked items were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the link to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;new monthly newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&quot;&gt;December domain discounts&lt;/a&gt;, which tells me that a lot of the people interested in domain discounts aren’t regularly visiting our blog or site—which is perfectly understandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/ideegeo.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform&quot;&gt;link to help&lt;/a&gt; with the iwantmyname API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for certain that this is common for newsletters, but the analytics for this particular send seems to support the thinking that our customers would like a monthly edition, and that there are certain topics and tidbits people would like delivered to them on a semi-regular basis. That alone is reason enough to publish a monthly edition, so everything extra is gravy, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TLDR?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need monthly newsletters because people tend to appreciate news and ideas presented in unobtrusive, easily deletable packages. Brands are unique in that they have a ton of combined knowledge to share, but (I’m serious about this) customers shouldn’t have to spend more than 30 minutes a month to keep up with their latest thought technologies. If you want to follow a brand&amp;#39;s blogs and social posts, that’s awesome, but you shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you’d like to hear more from us (unobtrusively), be sure to subscribe to our new monthly newsletter, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;iwantmyname:Monthly&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be sending our first edition later on this week, and we think you’ll really like it (and if you don’t, just unsubscribe…&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB5ceAruYrI&quot;&gt;hakuna matata&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Startup and tech domain name trends in 2015 and beyond. What’s coming after .IO, .CO, and .ME?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the internet, .COM was the top choice for companies and their online presences. Then, in the second half of the 2000s, we saw country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; become popular alternatives for tech startups and developers. Now, after the 2014 introduction of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, we’re looking at yet another shift. So which TLDs will take the reigns in the tech/startup world? Let’s take a look at some of the contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-software&quot;&gt;.SOFTWARE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&quot;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-digital&quot;&gt;.DIGITAL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good options, but with shorter alternatives (e.g. .TECH and .APP) yet to launch, we’ll have to wait and see how they do in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, developers can choose between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-codes&quot;&gt;.CODES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-consulting&quot;&gt;.CONSULTING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-build&quot;&gt;.BUILD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(On a side note, we were surprised to see .CODES being used for personal sites, i.e. yourname.CODES)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain extensions coming soon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tech&quot;&gt;.TECH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cloud&quot;&gt;.CLOUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-data&quot;&gt;.DATA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-systems&quot;&gt;.SYSTEMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.APP is certainly the 800-pound gorilla here, and we’re expecting it to do really, really well (it’s the TLD with the most pre-orders at iwantmyname).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the TLDs above are technology related (for the article), but if you pull back a bit, there&amp;#39;s a much more important trend at play here—naming diversity. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;more than 200 new gTLDs already available&lt;/a&gt; and many more to come, why would you restrict yourself by following trendy naming patterns, like what happened in the past with .LY (remember these?), or extensions with inexact meanings like .IO, .CO, and .ME? If you’re starting the next Instagram (which launched using the instagr.AM domain hack), wouldn’t it be better to use instagram.PHOTOS or a more generic instagram.APP, for example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the .IO, .ME, and .CO domains initially became popular was that they were empty namespaces with lots of keywords available. However, good names are starting to become rare in these “tech-TLDs”, and that’s exactly why we’re so excited about the new top-level domain alternatives. There are now more naming options than ever, and it will take a while—if ever—until good and affordable names are hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will there be a next .IO, .ME or .CO (which are still great domain extensions by the way)? If anything, we see .APP as the most likely contender, but there&amp;#39;s no set launch date yet. Until then, when choosing a domain, just remember that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/doing-is-almost-always-more-important-than-worrying.html&quot;&gt;doing is almost always more important than worrying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Are your messaging apps/tools secure?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Security is one of those things people tend to shy away from because it&amp;#39;s inconvenient, but keeping things safe is often as easy as using the right service. If you do a lot of online chatting, be sure to check out this secure messaging scorecard from the EFF—it&amp;#39;s an interesting read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard&quot;&gt;From the Electronic Frontier Foundation:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of widespread Internet surveillance, we need a secure and practical means of talking to each other from our phones and computers. Many companies offer “secure messaging” products—but are these systems actually secure? We decided to find out, in the first phase of a new EFF Campaign for Secure &amp;amp; Usable Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scorecard represents only the first phase of the campaign. In later phases, we are planning to offer closer examinations of the usability and security of the tools that score the highest here. As such, the results in the scorecard below should not be read as endorsements of individual tools or guarantees of their security; they are merely indications that the projects are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Start naming your brands and domains like a pro</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Naming and choosing domains often go hand-in-hand, but many don&amp;#39;t take either as seriously as they probably should. To get a glimpse of the professional naming process, take a gander at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/the-weird-science-of-naming-new-products.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Weird Science of Naming New Products&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; by Neal Gabler of the New York Times Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to do everything — to leave no word unturned. He visits the website onelook.com, which shows how words work with other words, or sketchengine.co.uk, which combs texts and concordances, flags parts of speech and shows how a specific word appears in billions of words of text. He visits rhymezone.com to find all the words that rhyme with a word. That is how he came up with the name for an ideation application for the Palm Pilot — he began with “brain,” looked for rhyming words and concluded with BrainForest. For this project, he thought of words about travel, but also about entertainment, the sense of engagement, connection, energy, even spheres. And he laid them all out on an Excel spreadsheet — 1,200 names in all by the time he had finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a single project, namers can come up with as many as 6,500 names. Big naming companies will do anywhere from 40 to 50 projects a year, and smaller ones 15 to 20, which adds up to a lot of names. Of course, only one name will be chosen for each project, and that is the only one the client will own. The rest, however, won’t necessarily go to waste. Every naming agency keeps a list of its discards in a computer program. These are then classified by message (at Catchword); by distinctiveness, appeal, memorability and concept (at Interbrand); or by whatever other way the namers might want to retrieve them. Catchword has 650 of these categorized lists. And many of the names will be recycled, which suggests that there is a kind of Platonic ideal of good names, independent of products good or bad — a name so good that it could work, if not on anything, than at least on many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now clearly many (if not most) people/brands can&amp;#39;t afford the premium costs of naming firms, but we should all strive to dig a bit deeper into our brands and ideals before coming up with names (if you don&amp;#39;t have at least 100 ideas on paper, you&amp;#39;re probably not trying hard enough). Just another something to add to your 2015 resolutions list. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Things to know about domains before buying your first domain name</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never more apparent how puzzling domain names are to people than when I get asked about my job. “A domain registrar? What the heck is that?” I get it all the time, but what surprises me most is that many of these same people already own domains in some form or another—usually brokered through legacy web-design firms charging $20-30/mo for Flash websites with glitzy visitor counters (seriously, if you&amp;#39;re paying $30/mo for a site built a decade ago, you&amp;#39;re getting ripped off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my goal of goals is to set them on the right path, usually with an abridged version of this very post—my spiel on domain names, what you’re buying, what the deal is with all the new domain extensions, what email has to do with it all, and a bit about Whois privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-1&quot;&gt;Domain name? Domain registrar?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-2&quot;&gt;Domain extensions, or top-level domains (TLDs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3&quot;&gt;The new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4&quot;&gt;What to do with your domain name?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5&quot;&gt;A final word about privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6&quot;&gt;And please, don’t be shy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;1. Domain name? Domain registrar?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to get in the right frame of mind, let&amp;#39;s think of the internet at an entirely new planet Earth. Then, think of the domain extensions (like .com, ,net, .edu) as countries, and the individual domain names (like iwantmyname.com or yourname.com) as pieces of property within those countries. Then, as your domain registrar, iwantmyname is like a big real estate agency, able to sell you a piece of property in a ton of countries on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internet is a huge planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain extensions are countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual domain names are property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain registrars are your real estate agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the writer of this, I’m your content guide to internet real estate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;2. Domain extensions, or top-level domains (TLDs)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginnings of the public internet, the web was filled with a fairly limited number of domain extensions (also called top-level domains (or TLDs)). In the US, most websites ended in .com, .net, .org, .edu, or .gov, and around the world, many sites adopted their country code top-level domains (or ccTLDs)—like .co.uk in the UK and .co.nz in New Zealand. No matter where you were though, .com was the clear popularity leader, and that popularity advantage still exists today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, .com is like a country, and like any country, there’s limited desirable space. And limited desirable space always leads to overcrowding. The problem is twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With more and more people getting on the internet, we’re starting to run out of short, memorable domain names. And by run out, I mean that by 2014, every two, three, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html&quot;&gt;four letter .com domain had already been registered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not like all these domains are being used though. Basic rules of supply and demand brought countless opportunistic businessmen who bought up these domains and started selling them on the domain aftermarket for premium prices (some even went in the million-dollar range!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people blame these so-called cybersquatters for the lack of good .com names available, but it’s hard to blame them for wanting to be part of the action (do you blame real-estate speculators for the lack of cheap property in your area?). Just remember that this supply/demand issue is based on the fact that the only desirable TLD is .com, which was borderline true in years past. If the amount of good options multiply through...what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-3&quot;&gt;3. The new gTLDs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the details and backstory, but in 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;hundreds upon hundreds of new domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; were created (often called the new generic TLDs (gTLDs), or new TLDs (nTLDs)), making that lack of quality domain names a thing of the past. Now, if I want to use my name in a domain, I can get Chris.ninja, Chris.club, Chris.cool, Chris.enterprises, Chris.vodka, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I hinted at already, the problem we’re running into now isn’t a supply issue, it’s a human nature issue—people are afraid of the unknown. Sticking with the property analogy, if you open a shiny new store in a brand new place, will people find it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all depends on how you’re being discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If social media is your biggest traffic driver, your links will work fine no matter what your TLD is. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on who you ask, there might actually be a small search engine optimization (SEO) advantage to using a new gTLD (but maybe none at all). As long as your brand is good and your copy isn’t spammy, your search engine results should be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only potential harm is if people think your domain looks like a scam because of your TLD. There&amp;#39;s a fairly small (in the scheme of things) history of spam websites buying up domain names similar to real brand names on various TLDs, but as long as your brand doesn&amp;#39;t include fake looking strings of numbers, random characters (usually lots of dashes), or fishy misspellings, you should be fine. As more and more big/legitimate websites adopt these new domain extensions, that stigma should go away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of articles online that have research “proving” either side of the discoverability debate (whether the new gTLDs are good or bad for business), but my stance is that there are too many people with too much money invested into these new gTLDs for them to completely fail. Maybe none of them will reach the popularity of .com, but people’s attitude towards domains that don’t end in .com is definitely starting to shift. My best advice would be to worry about the name of your brand first, then find an applicable TLD to fit it. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;hundreds to choose from&lt;/a&gt; now, so there&amp;#39;s no reason to be bound to the crowded land of .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-4&quot;&gt;4. What to do with your domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve established that domain names are property—what kinds of things can you build on it? Let’s run through a couple options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Build a website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common thing to do with a domain name is to build a website. And unless you’re deft at writing code (if so, you probably don’t need to be reading this), the best course of action is to use one of the many platforms available to build your site with ease (many have templates or some form of drag-and-drop tools available, making web design easy enough for everyone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the gist. On one end, you have your domain name, and on the other, you have a website built on a platform like Squarespace. To get your Squarespace site to pair with your domain, you have to add the correct DNS records to your domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at iwantmyname, we make that part easy. Once you buy your domain, you can set it up to work with many of the web’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/&quot;&gt;most popular platforms&lt;/a&gt; with just a few clicks. So instead of worrying about editing DNS records, you can get started with a platform like Squarespace, Shopify, Tumblr, or Ghost in a snap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously... it’s almost automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A quick word about www.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while we get asked how much it costs to add the www. to a website. It’s totally free—the www. is just a subdomain that isn’t necessary, but still common because people got used to saying it in the 90’s. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;platform setups&lt;/a&gt; add the www. option automatically, so there’s no need to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Get an email address&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we get asked most is how to get a custom email address. So first, let’s be clear about how your domain name fits into your email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at an email address, it usually looks something like this—chris@yourname.com. To create this, the owner of yourname.com had to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the yourname.com domain name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select and sign up for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;email hosting service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point the domain name to that email hosting service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add individual email addresses (like chris@yourname.com) through the email hosting service admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like anything on the web, there are a lot of different companies out there that do email hosting—Google, Fastmail, Zoho, etc. All of them will be able to get your mail from point A to point B, but they all offer slightly different features at different price points. My suggestion would be to head to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;email plugin page&lt;/a&gt;, then look at each platform’s website to see which features you’d be happiest with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sometimes you just need to wait for inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some people, getting a domain means there&amp;#39;s an immediate plan. For others, it’s important to wait for inspiration to strike. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens to me all the time. I’ll be driving home from lunch, thinking about how to best tell people about my awesome dining experience, then decide to create a restaurant review website. After an hour or so of quick naming exercises, I’ll grab a domain to kickstart the writing process (kind of like buying a guitar to guilt yourself into learning how to play). But sometimes, if I lose interest too fast, I’ll sit on the domain for a month or two while the ideas percolate—once you register a domain, it’s yours for a year, so there’s no big rush. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that if you don’t decide to use the domain, be sure to turn renewals off so you won’t keep paying for it year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-5&quot;&gt;5. A final word about privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online privacy has been all over the news lately (for good reason), and one of the easier things you can do to hide some of your information is to enable Whois privacy (it’s free) on your domain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425-do-you-offer-a-whois-privacy-service-&quot;&gt;Here’s a good guide&lt;/a&gt; to how Whois privacy works and how to enable it, but please note that only the domain extensions listed in that article support it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-6&quot;&gt;6. And please, don’t be shy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, the internet can be a big, scary place. If you ever run into any issues with your domain, or just can’t figure out how to link it to the platform you want, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;send us a message&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll be sure to help out. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SEO penalties of moving our blog to a subdomain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start this article by confessing that we’re not SEO gurus at iwantmyname. Everything we&amp;#39;ve done in the last few years in terms of SEO was done with a basic understanding of the topic and by providing a good product with relevant content and landing pages. This always served us well and we were happy with our rankings overall. With that out of the way, I’d like to tell you about our experience with switching our blog to a subdomain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning of July last year, we moved our blog from a subdirectory URL (&lt;code&gt;iwantmyname.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;) to a subdomain (&lt;code&gt;blog.iwantmyname.com&lt;/code&gt;) for better maintainability and performance with GitHub Pages&amp;#39; &lt;abbr title=&quot;content delivery network&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/abbr&gt; and future-proofing in case we wanted to switch to a different platform down the road. We made this decision after doing lots of research and had long discussions about how it might impact our search engine rankings, but we ultimately agreed to make the change. After all, it was 2014 and Google should be clever enough that it wouldn’t make any difference because they know the blog (subdomain or not) is part of iwantmyname, right? As Matt Cutts said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MswMYk05tk&quot;&gt;in one of his webmaster videos&lt;/a&gt; “it’s a question which one is easier for you and whichever one makes you happier I would go and do it that way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we expected an initial hit after making the subdomain switch and traffic slowly recovering, the turnaround didn’t happen after 6 months, as you can see in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-01-16-blog-traffic-subdomain-switch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blog traffic after switch to subdomain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what we can tell, we did everything by the books with &lt;code&gt;301&lt;/code&gt; redirects for all URLs - so what happened? Could it have been just coincidence that Google updated their algorithm and we got penalized for some reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One signal that Google introduced one month after us making the switch was to give SSL-secured sites a little ranking boost. Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iwantmyname/blog&quot;&gt;our blog is running on GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156&quot;&gt;doesn’t currently support HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;, could that have prevented the traffic from recovering? Certainly it can’t be that much of a ranking signal—although they mentioned it would increase in importance over time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after waiting for six months, we reverted the change and switched our blog back to the previous &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. It’s still hosted on GitHub Pages and we’re using a simple Nginx proxy to show the content under &lt;code&gt;iwantmyname.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;location = /blog {
  # GitHub Pages doesn&amp;#39;t redirect this properly, so we&amp;#39;ll handle it
  return 301 /blog/;
}

# ^~ to allow /blog/ to match before our other regex locations
location ^~ /blog/ {
  proxy_pass https://iwantmyname.github.io;
  proxy_intercept_errors on;
  # serve custom 404 page from our blog repo instead of GitHub Pages&amp;#39; 404
  error_page  404  /blog/404.html;
  # allow GitHub to pass caching headers instead of using our own
  expires off;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important side effect is that our blog pages are now secured under our primary SSL certificate again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this experience and the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com/community/q/moz-s-official-stance-on-subdomain-vs-subfolder-does-it-need-updating#reply_217479&quot;&gt;recommendation from Moz’s Rand Fishkin&lt;/a&gt;, we decided it would be better for our long-term SEO strategy to put our blog back on our primary domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would still strongly urge folks to keep all content on a single subdomain. We recently were able to test this using a subdomain on Moz itself (when moving our beginner&amp;#39;s guide to SEO from guides.moz.com to the current URL http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo). The results were astounding - rankings rose dramatically across the board for every keyword we tracked to the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will certainly keep a close eye on traffic for the next few months and keep you updated. Hope this helps some of you when deciding on the age-old debate of whether you should have your blog on a subdomain or not!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New gTLDs and SEO performance</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150112_new_gtlds_show_promising_seo_performance/&quot;&gt;From Roland LaPlante - CircleID:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), many marketers are excited that they can now get a web address that best describes their business or brand. For instance, a company in the organic business can now get a web address on .ORGANIC, or a brand that&amp;#39;s all about passion and excitement can now get on .RED, etc. At the same time, many are also asking some important SEO related questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will Google crawl new gTLDs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will new gTLDs automatically score higher in Google&amp;#39;s search algorithms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the SEO best practices for migrating a site to a new gTLD?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should brands REALLY get on new gTLDs and give up the status quo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s address them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to use a standard Gmail account for free custom domain email</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplyian.com/2015/01/07/Hacking-GMail-to-use-custom-domains-for-free/&quot;&gt;From Ian Macalinao:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much common knowledge that GMail is awesome. It’s fast, connects seamlessly with the rest of your Google services such as Drive, has a cool app called Inbox, and is overall an extremely powerful email service. However, to use it with a custom domain, you need to purchase Google Apps for either $5 or $10/month, which for casual users is a bit unnecessary. On top of that, you don’t even get all of the features a personal account gets, e.g. Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a free way to use your GMail account with a custom domain: Mailgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat trick for more advanced users to set up custom domain email using a standard Gmail account and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailgun.com&quot;&gt;Mailgun&lt;/a&gt; (for up to 10,000 emails a month). &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/yes-you-can-still-get-free-custom-email-addresses.html&quot;&gt;Yes, you can still get free custom domain email addresses&lt;/a&gt; — even in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Doing is almost always more important than worrying</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/&quot;&gt;From The Name Inspector:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Name Inspector has been reflecting on last year’s startup names while sipping on what’s left of the apple peel bourbon he made for the holidays. He’s got to say, it seems like some of these companies were named by people who sipped lots of bourbon. Here are some weird names of startups in CrunchBase that were founded in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when Nirvana (the band) first started getting played on the radio. Most of my friends were really into the music, but all I could think was “I’m pretty sure I have what it takes to sing incomprehensible lyrics, too! I’m definitely going to be a rock star.” And sure, naming your brand is a whole lot different than singing songs, but the message is similar—extreme talent aside, Nirvana was a success because they actually made music. I wasn’t because I was too worried about everything to ever get on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say, and what a lot of the startups mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/&quot;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; prove, is that you shouldn’t let branding uncertainty (or even wackiness) prevent you from doing what you want to do. Sure, maybe you think it’s a mistake to name a brand &lt;em&gt;AssessUp&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;KeeeWeee&lt;/em&gt;, but look at all these brands. They exist...they’re real companies with profiles on CrunchBase! You just never know what might become the next big household brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, that same thought process also works for domain extensions. I talk to people all the time who spend a lot of energy worrying about not getting the perfect .com, but the world is changing, and people’s comfort level with “strange” non-.com’s is growing by the day. If what you’re creating is good, people will find you wherever you’re at—.io, .co, your local country code top-level domain (ccTLD), or any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; on the market. Just go with the domain that fits your brand best—the rest will often work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The January domain discounts, including .Vegas and .Asia</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a new year, so let&amp;#39;s talk a bit about domain discounts. This month, we have a host of sales carrying over from December, plus two location-based TLDs moonlighting as cultural favorites. .Vegas, hailing from the US city of Las Vegas, is synonymous on the web (and elsewhere) with gambling culture, and will likely draw interest with gaming sites and travel microsites. And .Asia, the world&amp;#39;s largest continent, is attempting to bring online nations together for business and trade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at 2015&amp;#39;s first domain discount list, and start the new year right with a shiny new online space.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of January (2015!), including .degree, .space, and .band</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 is done, folks. Our new gTLD catalogue is now filled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;257 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, including the ever-popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&quot;&gt;.link&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.guru&lt;/a&gt; (and of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.kiwi&lt;/a&gt;), and we have a ton more to come in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the big question...has the new gTLD launch been a success? Well, it depends what your metric is. .Xyz recently hit the 750,000 domains registered mark, making it the most registered new gTLD out there, and as Peter Roesler of Inc. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/will-new-top-level-domains-matter-in-2015.html&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;If you want to use one of the new TLDs to build a site with an easy-to-remember name, you won&amp;#39;t be disappointed&amp;quot;. Sure, the registration numbers aren&amp;#39;t to the level of .com yet, but I think any gTLD registry owner would tell you it&amp;#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I&amp;#39;d expect to see steady gTLD growth as more people become aware of their existence (if the general public knew about the glorious &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza&quot;&gt;.pizza&lt;/a&gt; extension, we&amp;#39;d see an online pizza renaissance for sure). And with another year of new launches, paired with the ever-dwindling supply of good remaining .coms, the growth might be faster than people expect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prognostication aside, we have a big year of gTLDs ahead of us, and it all begins with the 11 new extensions we&amp;#39;re launching this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

				<title>Reply All covers Longform.org’s attempt to buy their corresponding .com</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never resold or purchased a domain on an aftermarket in my life, but hearing stories about that side of the domain industry is vastly entertaining. There’s intrigue, secret internet dealings, big characters, big egos—it’s all there. And this week, one of my favorite new podcasts, Reply All, covered Longform.org’s attempt to purchase their corresponding .com from Michael Berkens, reseller extraordinaire and founder of The Domains. It’s a good one—give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Just a heads up...if you’re easily offended, there are a couple curse words in this episode. Nothing big, but they’re there.)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dear internet, it’s time to fix your footer (again)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few certainties in life—death, taxes, the fact that eggs always taste better with a dash of hot sauce, and that on January 1st, the little numbers in the year will change ever so slightly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-internet, this wasn’t such a big deal. Sure, you might write the wrong year on a check or document, but it wasn’t an error the world would have to see on a daily basis. Not like on a website, where nearly all the footers in existence—the big footers, small footers, dark footers, and light footers—share one tiny trait. © 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “nearly” because every year there are those who forget to manually change the year from one to the next. It’s a bit of a minor tragedy, but entirely understandable. Fortunately, Mikko Järvenpää has your back, with a clever site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://updateyourfooter.com&quot;&gt;updateyourfooter.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever looked at a website and wondered if it is still in operation? Maybe a thing or two looked like they could have been updated – and then you notice the copyright notice the in the footer. &amp;quot;2012. Right, this site must be dead. Let&amp;#39;s move along.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it could be that the owner just forgot to update the year in the footer. That happens a lot, especially if those years are hard-coded strings. To future-proof your footer, it&amp;#39;s better to just let computers take care of this. Grab one of these snippets and paste that on your page (or forward this site as a friendly reminder to someone who can do it for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before the new year hits, grab a snippet for your site and leave your worries behind. Hakuna matata.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Holiday cheer, some news items, and a bit of relaxation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The holidays are upon us, and we’d like to thank you all for making 2014 so great. In the last year, we upped our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; size to ten, passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/celebrating-100000-domains-at-iwantmyname.html&quot;&gt;100,000 domains registered&lt;/a&gt; mark (and beyond), added more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;250 new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) to the list, and managed to keep our &lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;support satisfaction at 97%&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really been incredible—so thank you, thank you, thank you. We can’t say it enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting January 2015, we’re launching our monthly newsletter. In it, we’ll include all our domain sales, new gTLD launches, important news, and interesting tidbits to make your month a little better. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&quot;&gt;signup page&lt;/a&gt;—we really think you’ll enjoy it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE&quot;&gt;Developers, developers, developers!&lt;/a&gt; 2015 will be a big year for our API, and we’d love to hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/12/api-survey.html&quot;&gt;your thoughts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speaking of support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a note. With Christmas here and New Year’s coming up, support may be a little slower (but no less thorough) than our usual standard. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;Support Center&lt;/a&gt; is stocked with answers to a bunch of questions though, so be sure to check there first if you’re running into any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... sweet as. And happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Sweet Setup’s top third-party email app for OSX</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/favorite-email-client-os-x/&quot;&gt;From Jason Snell - The Sweet Setup:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Apple makes it, Mail is for everybody. But it’s not for everybody. Apple designed it to serve the masses, and if you want more–or less–from your email client, Apple Mail may not suit you. Maybe its old-school approach to mail, lifted from classic mail clients like Eudora and NeXTMail, just doesn’t fit the modern emailer. Maybe you want deep links to productivity apps on your Mac that Mail just won’t provide. Or maybe you’re just tired of being in a dysfunctional relationship with Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think Mailbox is the best alternative to Apple Mail out there, but it only works with Gmail or iCloud. If you’re not using either of those providers, the best Mail alternative compatible with most POP/IMAP/Exchange servers is the $10 Airmail 2. Airmail feels like an attempt to create a true replacement for Apple Mail, rather than rethinking the way we process email like Mailbox. However, Airmail also has the concept of filing a message to a “To Do” folder for later processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is one of those things people really struggle with, but there are so many tools and apps out there you may find to be more tuned to your liking. If you’re looking for a New Year’s resolution you can actually stick to, commit to making your life a little saner with an email app that fits your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Deep thoughts on the future SEO benefits of the new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/12/17/could-new-tlds-have-an-seo-benefit-in-the-future/&quot;&gt;From Andrew Allemann - Domain Name Wire:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new top level domain name instead of a .com or other gTLD does not give you a benefit in Google search results. Ditto for using a .com instead of a new TLD. They’re basically the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Google says. And it makes sense when you think about it. A lot of people that think new TLDs have an SEO advantage are thinking with their heart, not with their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it doesn’t make sense for Google to favor a new TLD over an existing TLD at this point, it could make sense in the future. It would make sense if it improved search results. Let’s go through some of the arguments that ranking new TLDs ahead of other TLDs would benefit search results, and consider if they are valid now and if they will be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New feature alert—we now support USD, NZD, AUD, GBP and EUR!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-14-multicurrency.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multicurrency&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve been on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname website&lt;/a&gt; lately, you might&amp;#39;ve noticed a change in parts of the site—a new multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices (and accepting payments) in only USD (US Dollar), you can switch currencies to NZD (New Zealand Dollar), GBP (British Pound), AUD (Australian Dollar), and EUR (Euro). It&amp;#39;s a small feature, but one we&amp;#39;re really happy to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Little Backstory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we&amp;#39;re a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we&amp;#39;ve officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we&amp;#39;re really happy with how it&amp;#39;s working (being based in New Zealand, it&amp;#39;s nice to be able to pay in NZD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you&amp;#39;re looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currency: in the footer (see screenshot below), on all our price lists (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), and in your account payment settings. We&amp;#39;ve also set it up to be location aware, so new customers should automatically be assigned to their correct currency. Once switched, all prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-14-nzd.png&quot; alt=&quot;NZD&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have any questions about multicurrency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;feel free to ask&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Did you authorize Con Group Co. to register a domain name?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/12/15/best-fake-name-used-in-a-domain-name-scam-ever/&quot;&gt;From Andrew Allemann - Domain Name Wire:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works: A scammer, typically pretending to be an Asian domain name registrar, sends an email to the owner of a domain name and says that someone else is trying to register domain names using the same brand. The scammer says they’re reaching out as a courtesy. If the recipient doesn’t respond, the scammer says it will go forward with registering the domain names. The con is to try to get you to register the domains as a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these scam emails identify the name of the purported company trying to register the “brand” in various ccTLDs. My wife got one of these emails over the weekend, and the name of the purported company is, well, quite hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>The photography domain extension showdown</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a booming suburb of sorts, and one of my most vivid memories (you can&amp;#39;t choose what sticks!) was of a strange clump of business-centric hotels that popped up just off the freeway near my house. Even to a grade-schooler, the likelihood of all these rooms filling up on a given weekend was extremely low, yet the construction marched on. Knowing the basics of supply and demand, I was baffled, so I asked my dad to explain the logic. He said, &amp;quot;Well... it looks like all the market researchers saw the same opportunity at the same time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve learned since then is that competition is good, but unless the demand is huge, some of the players will inevitably lose out. So here I am, looking at a handful of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) related to photography, wondering A. why the world needs five extensions for the same purpose, and B. which one(s) will rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; question will have to be for a later post, but predicting popularity is a thought exercise I can get behind. So let&amp;#39;s lay out the contenders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&quot;&gt;.photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos&quot;&gt;.photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&quot;&gt;.pics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pictures&quot;&gt;.pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Current Stats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current popularity isn&amp;#39;t necessarily indicative of future success, but it is a good place to start. Here are the total registration stats (up to the time of writing) according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com&quot;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.photography - 49,651&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.photos - 16,820&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.photo - 11,988&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.pics - 6,017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.pictures - 4,241&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.Photography is clearly in the lead, but the gTLD program is still in its first year, so there&amp;#39;s plenty of time for the other extensions to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keyword Planner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pretend for a bit that I&amp;#39;m a picture-taker looking for maximum exposure. Like many people trying to brand themselves, I want my brand to be Chris Hall [INSERT PHOTO TLD], which would give me chrishall.TLD. Using Google&amp;#39;s Keyword Planner, here are the worldwide search stats for each of the gTLDs as keywords. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photography - 368,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photos - 450,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photo - 823,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pics - 201,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pictures - 673,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo wins this battle by a longshot, but keep in mind that this would be for a worldwide audience. If you&amp;#39;re just doing photography in the US, you&amp;#39;d want to modify the search for that audience (pictures is the winner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind though that search volume isn&amp;#39;t necessarily your friend. My general rule of thumb is that the more popular a search term, the more established the brands will be trying to rank for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a guy who&amp;#39;s more than willing to pay for a better, more fulfilling experience (I&amp;#39;ll take a craft brew over a big-box bottle any day), but when all things are equal, I do glance at prices. Fortunately, all the TLDs on this list are in the same basic price range, but there&amp;#39;s still a winner and loser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .pictures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminated: .photo (.photo costs more than .photos, and given how similar they are, it&amp;#39;d be hard not to go with the less expensive option)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;General Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One naming test I like to use is the confusion test. Here&amp;#39;s an example: If you have a .co domain name, how many people are going to accidentally type in .com? I can&amp;#39;t speak for others, but it drives me nuts when I type in a domain and get thrown off by the domain extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with the new gTLDs, I&amp;#39;m to a point where I don&amp;#39;t instantly type in .com—but I still get thrown off by extensions that are too similar. And in this group, the fact that .photo and .photos are just one letter apart really stresses me out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminated: .photos (I already eliminated .photo)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Length&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manually typing out domain names is probably pretty rare these days, but shorter names (and extensions) have quite a few benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less spelling errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generally easier to say&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less space needed on a sign or business card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .pics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#39;s be honest, the kiddos aren&amp;#39;t typing out full words anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Specificity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people ask for my opinion on the matter, I tend to put aside all the SEO and just go with specificity—what works best for your brand? If you&amp;#39;re a photographer, I&amp;#39;d go with .photography. If you&amp;#39;re not a photographer, things get a little muddy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the other gTLDs on the list, there seems to be one that&amp;#39;s not like the others—.pictures. I happen to like .pictures as a TLD, but if someone told me their domain ended with .pictures, I might wonder if they&amp;#39;re a photographer or an illustrator (maybe they draw their pictures?). For that reason, I&amp;#39;m bailing on .pictures as a winning option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminated: .pictures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for definitive, scientifically proven answers, I don&amp;#39;t think I have what you&amp;#39;re looking for. Truth be told, if you&amp;#39;re a good photographer (or a bad one with lots of fans), it probably doesn&amp;#39;t matter which TLD you use. But, for argument&amp;#39;s sake, here are my winners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER (photographers): .photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographers do photography. They don&amp;#39;t just create pictures, they create art—so be proud of your calling and go with the corresponding gTLD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER (non-photographers): .pics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not a photographer, you might as well eliminate all the fluff. Cut the letters, bypass the excess search competition, and go with .pics.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Is it still worthwhile to have keywords in domains?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canirank.com/blog/keyword-domains/?session=22f69924c5835d1f302e33d3a4529b55&quot;&gt;From the Can I Rank blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyword domain names were once thought of as a golden ticket to top rankings, but the general consensus in the SEO community seems to be that their power has diminished in the wake of Google’s Exact Match Domain update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, if any, role do keyword domains play in SEO today? Is it still worth spending tens of thousands of dollars for a category-defining domain name if it’s not an automatic ticket the front of the line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we want to examine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are keyword domain names still beneficial?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much do they help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do they help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is that help worth, in dollar terms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever gone through the process of naming a website, you&amp;#39;ve probably struggled with this very issue—is it better for business to have your domain name stick to a brand (dominos.com) or a keyword (dominos&lt;strong&gt;pizza&lt;/strong&gt;.com)? I&amp;#39;d be the first to tell you not to worry about it—the quality of your product will eventually trump optimization in rankings—but my cavalier mentality might be getting in the way of a very real SEO benefit. Especially if your website is solely focused on a single topic or product.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Giving back in 2015—Karuna Bali and IDEP</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving back has always been part of the culture at iwantmyname—from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html&quot;&gt;hands-on teaching overseas &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/lightning-strikes-twice-in-wellingtons-startup-scene.html&quot;&gt;supporting our local tech startup scene&lt;/a&gt;—but on our 5th birthday we decided to do something a little more permanent. Given that there are only ten of us, our plan of action was to help fund &lt;a href=&quot;http://charitynavigator.org/&quot;&gt;highly efficient aid initiatives&lt;/a&gt; that could do so much more for people around the world than we ever could on our own. Our pledge was to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&quot;&gt;10 cents from each domain registered&lt;/a&gt; to a charity of our choosing, and our first recipient was Save the Children, who was working hard at the time to help the Philippines recover from Typhoon Haiyan (and they&amp;#39;re back on the ground now to help with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6150549/&quot;&gt;Typhoon Hagupit&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, our plan is to support local initiatives in Bali, an island that was very hospitable to us during our yearly planning meeting. While in Bali, two aid initiatives were brought to our attention—Karuna Bali and IDEP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karunabali.com/&quot;&gt;Karuna Bali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days after we settled in at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hubud.org/hubud-villa/&quot;&gt;Hubud&lt;/a&gt;, Novi Danto, an employee of Karuna, spoke to us about how the organization was making great strides in teaching teenage children from smaller villages who might not otherwise have access to educational opportunities. Based in the town of Campuhan, Karuna Bali provides education for young adults in introductory computing, English and personal leadership skills. Best of all, Karuna Bali&amp;#39;s administration is entirely funded, so &amp;quot;100% of sponsorship donations are applied to the program.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s a great cause, and our 2015 goal is to fully sponsor the tuition fees for three students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idepfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;IDEP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEP is a well established organization that works in the area of sustainable agriculture, mostly focusing on permaculture, tree planting, and youth environmental education. But a major side focus is training for natural disaster preparedness (which are a constant threat to the region), and assisting &amp;quot;local communities to provide food, shelter, energy and other needs in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.&amp;quot; IDEP employs local people, but also have a lot of support from offshore expertise and are endorsed by UNESCO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think IDEP has both the scale and depth of knowledge to make a substantial difference through education, farming practice, and helping to  build robust communities across Indonesia. Our goal is to contribute $10,000 to IDEP by the end of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many wonderful charities and initiatives that need funding around the world, so if you&amp;#39;re able, we encourage you to give back anything you can. And if you&amp;#39;d like to join us in funding our 2015 charities, here are the donation pages for both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karunabali.com/index.php?section=5&quot;&gt;Karuna Bali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idepfoundation.org/howyoucanhelp/donatetoday&quot;&gt;IDEP&lt;/a&gt; (and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6239401/k.C01C/Global_Action_Fund/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp&quot;&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt;, our 2014 choice). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ugh, invalid username/password</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/invalid-username-or-password-useless/&quot;&gt;From Kevin Burke:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we&amp;#39;ve done by promoting &amp;quot;Invalid username or password&amp;quot; is made our login form UX much, much worse, without increasing the security of our product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people don&amp;#39;t log in to your site every day (every site on the web except Facebook or Google), not remembering credentials is a huge barrier to accessing your site. Don&amp;#39;t make it harder by adding a vague error message that doesn&amp;#39;t increase your site&amp;#39;s security at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a tradeoff there between security and UX, I hear you say. I am trying to show you there is no tradeoff, as presented above; you are choosing between a better user experience and a worse user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of December, including .Paris, .pizza, and .business</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December is a bit of a slow month for new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), but the lack of quantity doesn&amp;#39;t mean there&amp;#39;s a lack of quality. This month, we have a big city launch in .Paris, a surefire hit in the pizza world with .pizza, and some additional TLDs that could be big in business circles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, with this being the last month of the year, be sure to check out how far the gTLD program has come. In the past year, we&amp;#39;ve added &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;247 new domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; to our collection, and will be above the 250 mark by the end of the month. If you&amp;#39;re looking to start a new website in 2015, finding a great domain name will be easier than ever—and we&amp;#39;re adding new gTLDs nearly every week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;December 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-paris&quot;&gt;.Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Hey developers! We need your input!</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning of iwantmyname, we wanted to build a beautiful API to let you to find, purchase, and manage domains names and DNS records programmatically. But until recently, we didn&amp;#39;t have the manpower to develop an API alongside maintaining our current platform. We got close to tackling it last year with our expanded team, but new ICANN requirements and the launch of hundreds of new domain extensions took priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/11/bali-trip.html&quot;&gt;in Bali&lt;/a&gt; last month, we decided that now is the time. With a clean slate, a newly formed &amp;quot;API Task Force&amp;quot;, and 5+ years of industry learnings, we&amp;#39;ve started &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.iwantmyname.com/docs/&quot;&gt;documenting our ideal API&lt;/a&gt; and laying the groundwork for development into 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you come along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers like yourself have been looking to do lots of things with an iwantmyname API. We&amp;#39;ve heard from people who want to build apps, integrate custom domains into platforms and services, and use our platform to dynamically update DNS records—but we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve created &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform&quot;&gt;a short and simple survey&lt;/a&gt; to help us better understand your needs so that we can design and prioritize features of the API right from the start. It should only take a few minutes to fill out and your feedback will be incredibly helpful in shaping our initial release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have our first API testing phase in early 2015 with a subset of features available. The rest of 2015 will be dedicated to fleshing out the remaining features of the API (many of which will be determined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform&quot;&gt;this survey&lt;/a&gt;) and building a new frontend and dashboard for iwantmyname powered by our own API. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 is shaping up to be a big year—I hope you&amp;#39;re as excited as we are!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.COM too expensive? One new podcast went with .LIMO and .DIAMONDS</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For the &amp;quot;do domain extensions really matter&amp;quot; archives. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gimletmedia.com&quot;&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt; just announced its first new podcast yesterday, Reply All. We&amp;#39;re not a podcast review site so I won&amp;#39;t go into details (tldr: it&amp;#39;s a great, story based podcast about the internet), but there&amp;#39;s one line in the end credits of the first episode I absolutely loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not go to replyall.com. It&amp;#39;s too expensive. We didn&amp;#39;t want to buy it. Instead, we bought replyall.limo and replyall.diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make of it what you will, but I&amp;#39;d say this is a case of &amp;quot;if your thing is popular, people will find you.&amp;quot; Don&amp;#39;t sacrifice your sane brand name because the .com is taken—there are plenty of alternative &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; out there, and if what you do is good, people will find you in your corner of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>That domain name you wanted might be available soon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From Domain Incite, in an article titled, &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/17702-over-180000-blocked-new-gtld-names-to-drop-next-week?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DomainIncite+%28DomainIncite.com%290&quot;&gt;Over 180,000 blocked new gTLD names to drop next week&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several new gTLD registries will release hundreds of thousands of currently blocked domain names — some of them quite nice-looking — next Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the first big batches of name collisions to be released to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies behind .xyz, .website, .press, .host, .ink, .wiki, .rest and .bar will release most of their blocked names at 1400 UTC on November 26.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A deep dive into the personal world of password creation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From The New York Times, in a wonderful article titled, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/magazine/the-secret-life-of-passwords.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;The Secret Life of Passwords&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEVERAL YEARS AGO I began asking my friends and family to tell me their passwords. I had come to believe that these tiny personalized codes get a bum rap. Yes, I understand why passwords are universally despised: the strains they put on our memory, the endless demand to update them, their sheer number. I hate them, too. But there is more to passwords than their annoyance. In our authorship of them, in the fact that we construct them so that we (and only we) will remember them, they take on secret lives. Many of our passwords are suffused with pathos, mischief, sometimes even poetry. Often they have rich back stories. A motivational mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar — these keepsake passwords, as I came to call them, are like tchotchkes of our inner lives. They derive from anything: Scripture, horoscopes, nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact and expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my biggest surprise has been how willing, eager actually, people are to openly discuss their keepsakes. The friends I queried forwarded my request, and before long I started receiving passwords from complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a long article, but definitely worth your time. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The 25 most popular new domain extensions on iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are 3,177,772 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) registered to date. What that says about the overall popularity of the rollout is up for debate, but there&amp;#39;s no denying the success of some of the extensions. .XYZ, .CLUB, and a bunch of the city gTLDs are doing quite well, and even some of the less popular ones (62 at the moment) have broken the 10,000 registrations mark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, at least for me, looking at an overall popularity list doesn&amp;#39;t really say anything. I want to know what the people I identify with are using, and for that, I need some specific stats—stats from our customers. Here&amp;#39;s what we found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The top 25 gTLDs on iwantmyname&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CLUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.LINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.GURU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.KIWI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.INTERNATIONAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.INSTITUTE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.ACADEMY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BLUE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TODAY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.EXPERT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.FOUNDATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.AGENCY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.GALLERY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NYC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.EMAIL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TIPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.LAND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.ZONE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.EDUCATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COMPANY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BEST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selected thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that hit me after seeing the list was how different it was than the ntldstats &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;popularity list&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few of the more interesting findings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.XYZ is nowhere to be found on our list, but it&amp;#39;s far-and-away the most registered new gTLD on the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BLUE is in our top 10, but is #120 overall. Perhaps our monthly &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&quot;&gt;domain discounts&lt;/a&gt; are more popular than I thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;re clearly popular amongst creative professionals. .PHOTO, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .AGENCY, .GALLERY, .CLOTHING, .COMPANY, and .TECHNOLOGY are all in our top 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As well as education: .INSTITUTE, .ACADEMY, .EDUCATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was to be expected—.GURU and .EXPERT are both on the list (we clearly have brilliant customers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t looked in a while (or at all), be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;gTLD page&lt;/a&gt;. We have 241 extensions available to be registered now, and a few hundred more that can be preordered through our system. New extensions are added every month, so don&amp;#39;t be a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A three-pronged approach to communications chaos</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you talk to the communications manager (or similar position) of a brand of just about any size, you might notice a small tinge of panic in their voice. It&amp;#39;s all just too much. On one hand, communicating with audiences is easier than ever, with seemingly infinite platforms to engage with infinite types of customers. But on the other hand, keeping up with it all while not sounding insane is madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a personal example. Our primary communications goal is to build an authentic brand relationship with our customers. That may sound like an oxymoron, but it&amp;#39;s really not. We&amp;#39;re not looking to be part of your social scene, and we&amp;#39;ll never expect you to wake up every morning pining over what we have to say, but we do hope that when your friends ask for a domain registrar recommendation, you&amp;#39;re confident enough in us steer them our way. And the best way to gain your trust (aside from constantly improving our platform) is to let you in a bit—to show you what we&amp;#39;re focusing on, thinking about, creating, and improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most active channel we have (by pure volume) is our growing handful of social feeds, but they require daily/hourly customer attention (as well as some interesting Buffer coordination). Our community is great (we have real readers who start real conversations), but a lot of what we&amp;#39;re posting gets lost in the black hole of the internet. As Marco Arment &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/2014/11/01/short-form-blogging&quot;&gt;stated recently&lt;/a&gt;, too many good ideas are being dumped into Twitter, where nearly everything is &amp;quot;immediately skimmed over, forgotten, and lost to the vast depth of the mostly unsearchable, practically inaccessible Twitter archive.&amp;quot; His example was Twitter, but it could really be said for any social network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in addition to social, we also have an active blog. But here&amp;#39;s the problem I have with blogs, especially blogs attached to brands—discovery is a mess. In my personal life, I&amp;#39;ve almost completely turned over my article-finding to the people and platforms sifting through the news best. Aggregators like Techmeme and Hacker News are so good at what they do, and my daily email from NextDraft adequately covers the rest of what&amp;#39;s going on in the world. Beyond that, nearly everything I read comes from Twitter, and as stated before, most tweets die moments after they&amp;#39;re posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick recap: So to get a blog post in front of me in 2014, it has to either get picked up by a tiny handful of eyes attached to aggregators, or tweeted enough times to catch me right when I&amp;#39;m checking. Bad news for brands—getting picked up by aggregators is hard, and the odds I&amp;#39;ll see any given tweet is quite low (and I check often... most people don&amp;#39;t even check their feed every day). Basically, you&amp;#39;d need a coordinated plan to get me to read anything not reaching critical mass, and as a brand writer myself, that&amp;#39;s so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve got a blog and all the social media platforms taken care of, our new goal is to find a way to reach our audience without having to make a constant scene. Something that&amp;#39;s completely opt-in, doesn&amp;#39;t get passed through too many confusing algorithm filters before it reaches people, and is distributed on a platform that everyone already has—email. Starting early 2015, we&amp;#39;re going to start sending a monthly email, and we think it&amp;#39;s the perfect channel for our brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a journalism outfit, most of our customers come to our site looking for something very specific—either to buy a domain or to mess with some DNS settings. The less we&amp;#39;re in the way, the better. And in a way, that&amp;#39;s how newsletters are meant to operate—just opt-in, read an occasional email (filled with all sorts of great stuff and interesting updates), and you&amp;#39;re done. Quick and painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all our channels, I really think the new email will be the best suited for our brand. But even still, I don&amp;#39;t think it quite cracks the brand messaging conundrum. The goal of these messaging channels is to humanize the experience—to make us seem like real people who care (we really do!)—but is it human to have a coordinated, three-pronged approach to interfacing with people at their desired consumption times? I&amp;#39;m not so sure, but I also don&amp;#39;t have a better solution yet (hence the insanity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the thinking continues (a good NZ beer might help).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Adventures in Markdown: Whiskey&#39;s new outline view</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have gambling addictions, some struggle with caffeine—my vice is Markdown apps. Much like the Twitter apps of yore (or the podcast apps of today), Markdown apps are a wonderland for developers to implement tiny-but-genius improvements to a fairly rigid set of rules. Apps like Mou (Mou 1.0 hit its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you&quot;&gt;funding goal&lt;/a&gt;!), Marked, and Byword are in constant rotation on my computer, and I’m always on the hunt for the next new creation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s always bugged me though with Markdown apps is their inability to organize longform content. I&amp;#39;m not talking about 1,000 word posts here—I mean book-length content. You can use all the header sizes you want, but without a way to visually see an outline and quickly move between sections and chapters, I just can&amp;#39;t see myself completely deleting the old, bloated word processors that still plague my hard drive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a new Markdown app in town I&amp;#39;m really excited about—&lt;a href=&quot;http://usewhiskey.com&quot;&gt;Whiskey&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s still in beta, but developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://soff.es&quot;&gt;Sam Soffes&lt;/a&gt; (who worked on Hipstamatic, Roon, Cheddar, and the deceptively brilliant Shares) seems to be adding a lot of the things I&amp;#39;ve been yearning for. Most notably (at least to me), a slick outline view you can toggle with a hotkey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a video example (from the dev):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/110486733?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whiskey clearly isn&amp;#39;t a finished product yet, but it&amp;#39;s pretty functional in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://usewhiskey.com/beta&quot;&gt;current form&lt;/a&gt;. So if you&amp;#39;re a fan of Markdown apps, I definitely recommend checking out the outline view implementation in the latest version. It&amp;#39;s pretty slick. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Should you put all your products and ideas on one domain?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it, I, like many of my colleagues, have a bit of a problem. I think of the web as a blank canvas, just waiting for my ideas to populate its empty space. And every time I have a new idea, I do one thing—scramble to grab the corresponding domain name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ongoing quest has gotten a bit easier since the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; (being able to get just about any name in some form is a huge time-saver), but the underlying problem still remains. If/when I lose interest trying to make small ideas flourish, I find myself sitting on a pile of empty dreams and untapped potential (at least until the domains expire). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real hurdle is the process it takes to create and market new sites. It&amp;#39;s much easier today than it was a decade ago, but you still have to design them (although templates are getting better and better), brand them, come up with a consistent content strategy, create a bunch of social accounts and mailing lists, then promote the hell out of them. It&amp;#39;s exhausting! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed solution? From Brian Knapp, in an article titled, &lt;a href=&quot;http://retromocha.com/learn/put-everything-on-one-domain/&quot;&gt;Everything On One Domain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much more value in having everything on this website than there is in having even two or three different domains we are managing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is when we want to launch something new or explore an idea, we just create a page and put it out there, email our list, and see what people think. Also, we don&amp;#39;t have to hunt for a new domain name for every idea we have. We just create a new page and boom, we&amp;#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found that any time you can increase focus and decrease friction in your business you are better off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, stop buying new domains and start focusing your energy on one domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Focusing on one domain worked pretty well for Apple, it might work for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I firmly agree with the one-site-all-product mentality for a lot of things (most of my ideas certainly don&amp;#39;t need full sites), but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s quite the one-size-fits-all solution the author suggests. Yes, using one domain for everything in the brand &amp;quot;worked pretty well for Apple&amp;quot; (although one could argue that Beats and FileMaker break the narrative), but would it have been good for Lifehacker to have started on a big, bundled Gawker Media site, or your local restaurant group to roll up its various entities into one big menu monster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, when you pile everything into one domain, you&amp;#39;re severely limiting your branding options. Instead of giving every new project start its own personality, you&amp;#39;re all but forced to roll everything into your overarching aesthetic. That&amp;#39;s fine for a small dev shop, or even a giant cohesive brand like Apple, but what happens when your ideas jump from music production to digital photography to urban farming? Might you want separate concepts then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, by putting all your ideas on one domain, are you limiting each idea&amp;#39;s potential success/growth? Would Twitter be Twitter if, in 2006, it shared a page with Odeo? Or would Basecamp have ever become a huge success if 37 Signals didn&amp;#39;t roll it out on its own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas, like most things, it all depends on what you&amp;#39;re looking to accomplish. If you&amp;#39;re finding yourself piling up domains to tickle your every fancy, it may be wise to take the advice of Brian Knapp. For me, my personal brand would be infinitely stronger if I&amp;#39;d just consolidated my random work over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to break out though. As I said before, the new gTLDs make it easier than ever to find great domain names (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html&quot;&gt;straying from .com is A-ok&lt;/a&gt; in my opinion), and in the scheme of things, the costs associated are fairly minimal. Just know that with every new site/project you create, whether it&amp;#39;s on your current site or a new one, you&amp;#39;re either stretching your capabilities to some degree or neglecting something old—and very few good things in life come from divided focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the wise Kenny Rodgers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn481KcjvMo&quot;&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got to know when to hold &amp;#39;em. Know when to fold &amp;#39;em. Know when to walk away. And know when to run.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>FastMail&#39;s new iOS/Android app makes it an even more viable Google Apps alternative</title>

&lt;p&gt;Google Apps are fine—in fact, they&amp;#39;re quite wonderful and have changed the industry in so many ways—but there are countless reasons why you might want to go with something non-Google for your email. Fortunately, there are quite a few alternatives out there, and one of our very favorites, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt;, released an awesome new app today making it an even more viable Google alternative. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bali, our destination for mapping out 2015</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being scattered all over the world has its advantages. For one, there are no work hours, set workspaces, or dress codes. And meetings are cut to a minimum because there&amp;#39;s only so much time everyone is online at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you need some face-to-face time to make in-person connections. To hash out real problems and create lasting solutions. So once a year, we like to meet up for a week or so and get it all out of our system. Last year we chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/the-iwantmyname-team-on-tour-fiji-edition.html&quot;&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, which is only a short 2.5 hour flight from New Zealand, and it went so well that we stayed with the four-letter theme and packed our bags for Bali. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-11-11-monkeys.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;monkeys&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bali, in case you don&amp;#39;t know, is a little tropical island east of Jakarta in Indonesia. You&amp;#39;ve likely heard of it, but unless you live in the region you probably don&amp;#39;t have a grasp of how dense its cities are. Here&amp;#39;s a quick comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bali - 5,780 km2 - 4,225,384 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Zealand - 268,021 km2 - 4,537,081 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a fraction of the land area, Bali fits in basically the same amount of people as all of New Zealand. And you can tell right away, from the moment you race out of the airport. Sure, there are vast stretches of jungle and open space, but the cities we were in—Denpasar and Ubud—are decidedly urban. Everything is packed in tight, and just a few steps in any direction are cafes, art shops, clothing stores, spas, and markets. And the roads are filled with a type of traffic I&amp;#39;d never seen before—lanes are really just guidelines, a coordination of emergency blinkers and honks replace traditional turn signal use, and every inch of free road is filled by daring scooter drivers. For the uninitiated, driving in Bali is complete chaos (just don&amp;#39;t do it), but with a cab or driver, it&amp;#39;s really quite amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-11-11-bali-beach.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;beach&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the city cores though are a collection of magical little places. Grand rice terraces, an unforgettable monkey forest, spectacular beaches, giant cliffs, ancient temples, the works. The island can be anything you want it to be—an exotic urban destination with spicy food and endless shopping, or a relaxing paradise with countless amenities. And it&amp;#39;s more affordable than you&amp;#39;d ever think—having the entire team come and stay in Bali for the week turned out to cost about the same as having everyone meet up in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-11-11-hubud-villa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hubud Villa&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the main purpose of the trip was 2015 planning, we found a unique rental in Ubud, a city in the forest, around 30-45 minutes north of Denpasar and the beach. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hubud.org/hubud-villa/&quot;&gt;a villa&lt;/a&gt; owned by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hubud.org&quot;&gt;Hubud&lt;/a&gt; CoWorking Space, a popular spot for all the area&amp;#39;s brightest tech founders, designers, writers, and developers. But in Ubud, even the coworking spaces are a bit funky, as the typical working environment is augmented by an in-house vegan raw bar/coffee shop, outdoor beanbag seating, and tons of events and learning opportunities. (As well as conferences like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.up.co/communities/indonesia/bali/startup-weekend/4891&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend Bali&lt;/a&gt;, which we&amp;#39;re happily sponsoring.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The villa itself was quite nice, with a beautiful pool that perpetually stayed cool throughout the hot, tropical days. And the large kitchen and outdoor meeting areas were perfect for getting the gang together, allowing us to gather for a number of concentrated days to work out the future of the company. The pain points, the growth areas, where we want to go as a group, and where we want to go as people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus was on balancing growth with who we are. We&amp;#39;re a small team by design, and we only grow when needs arise (i.e., we&amp;#39;re bootstrapped, so we take hiring decisions seriously). Nothing is rushed, and nothing is forced. Our main goal is not to be like GoDaddy, or to have millions upon millions of customers in the near future. We just want to keep providing great experiences to our customers, and comfortable livability to everyone on our team (team sanity is an under-appreciated metric). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2015, we&amp;#39;re going to work harder than ever to simplify domain registration and management for our customers—you. Because if we can keep you happy, maybe you&amp;#39;ll tell a friend or two about what we do. That&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ve grown from the start, and that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;ll be from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quick Bali tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-11-11-bali-coffee.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Seniman&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#39;re ever in Ubud searching for an excellent cup of coffee (I crave a solid pour-over in the morning), &lt;a href=&quot;http://senimancoffee.com&quot;&gt;Seniman Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is a great choice. The place is awesome for working or hanging out, the coffee and food are really good, and their cold brew is the best I had on the trip (there&amp;#39;s nothing quite like a cold brew on a hot Bali day).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mexican food addiction is real (particularly &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Mexican food addiction), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tacocasabali.com&quot;&gt;Taco Casa&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic option (they make their own tortillas).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bali is a good place for vegetarians, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d4930720-Reviews-The_Elephant_Restaurant_Bar-Ubud_Bali.html&quot;&gt;The Elephant&lt;/a&gt; was an excellent choice with an amazing view. If you go, be sure to get the fresh coconut. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t leave Bali without getting a massage. Find the best place you can afford (everything in Bali is quite affordable), and chill out for a bit. You probably deserve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The typical local beer is Bintang, and you&amp;#39;ll find it literally everywhere (sometimes it&amp;#39;s even there when you don&amp;#39;t want it). If and when you need something different, go find some Stark Beer. After endless Bintang, it really hits the spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>This is important—make sure your GitHub Pages DNS settings are up-to-date</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-11-08-github.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2014, GitHub Pages announced some major &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages&quot;&gt;content delivery improvements&lt;/a&gt;—and the DNS changes were made in our one-click installs nearly right away. But for customers who added GitHub Pages (using the old GitHub Pages DNS settings) before the announcement, this is an important message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting the week of November 10th, pushing to a misconfigured site will result in a build error and you will receive an email stating that your site&amp;#39;s DNS is misconfigured. Your site will remain available to the public, but changes to your site will not be published until the DNS misconfiguration is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the week of November 17th, there will be a week-long brownout for improperly configured GitHub Pages sites. If your site is pointed to a legacy IP address, you will receive a warning message that week, in place of your site&amp;#39;s content. Normal operation will resume at the conclusion of the brownout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting December 1st, custom domains pointed to the deprecated IP addresses will no longer be served via GitHub Pages. No repository or Git data will be affected by the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that if you&amp;#39;re using the old settings, you should receive an email from GitHub letting you know you need to make the change (or you can check &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1917-github-pages-legacy-ip-deprecation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see now). If you&amp;#39;re in this camp, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages custom domain setup&lt;/a&gt; to guide you through setting up your DNS settings correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as always, if you have any questions about the GitHub Pages improvements or the new DNS settings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;definitely let us know&lt;/a&gt;.  We&amp;#39;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of November, including .Quebec and a big trio from S. Africa</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domain (gTLD) program&lt;/a&gt; launched with a bang, but the month of October was a bit slower than the rest. Last month, only six domain extensions went live, but one particular TLD made a big wave—.NYC, which is already the eighth most popular extension available (still well behind .Berlin for the top spot for city extensions). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, things are picking back up a bit, with 15 domains coming out—and a few of them seem to be destined for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;top 25&lt;/a&gt; (.help seems like a good bet). Predicting domain extension popularity is certainly an inexact science though, so before I go off and put on my prognostication hat, here&amp;#39;s the full November list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;November 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-capetown&quot;&gt;.Capetown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-durban&quot;&gt;.Durban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-joburg&quot;&gt;.Joburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;November 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-market&quot;&gt;.market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-mortgage&quot;&gt;.mortgage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Time to do some hacking on DuckDuckGo</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-30-ddg.png&quot; alt=&quot;DDH&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; has long been one of our favorite search engines, and given the amount of programmers and developers we have in our community, it&amp;#39;s probably one of your favorites, too. (If you&amp;#39;re not using it, give DuckDuckGo a shot. Unlike Google/Bing, DDG doesn&amp;#39;t collect or share any personal information, and ads really are kept to a minimum.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, DuckDuckGo is letting the community &amp;quot;hack the search engine.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckhack.com/&quot;&gt;From DuckDuckHack:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-coders and coders alike: We need your help on plugin ideas, data sources and issues about current plugins. All of these activities are valuable and will help direct community efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For coders: DuckDuckHack is the best way to use your skills to help make DuckDuckGo a better search engine and a great way to get started in open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckhack.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckHack&lt;/a&gt; and check out the slick new landing page. And don&amp;#39;t be afraid to pitch in—I&amp;#39;d love to see their underdog search engine get bigger and better. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Moving all your content to Facebook is a really bad idea</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/facebook-offers-life-raft-but-publishers-are-wary.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;From The New York Times:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook hopes it has a fix for all that. The company has been on something of a listening tour with publishers, discussing better ways to collaborate. The social network has been eager to help publishers do a better job of servicing readers in the News Feed, including improving their approach to mobile in a variety of ways. One possibility it mentioned was for publishers to simply send pages to Facebook that would live inside the social network’s mobile app and be hosted by its servers; that way, they would load quickly with ads that Facebook sells. The revenue would be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of wholesale transfer of content sends a cold, dark chill down the collective spine of publishers, both traditional and digital insurgents alike. If Facebook’s mobile app hosted publishers’ pages, the relationship with customers, most of the data about what they did and the reading experience would all belong to the platform. Media companies would essentially be serfs in a kingdom that Facebook owns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter who you are, at the end of the day, if you&amp;#39;re writing worthwhile content meant to be read by worthwhile people, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to be in control of that content. And that requires your own domain name and a platform that gives you complete control over what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you don&amp;#39;t want is to be solely dependent on someone else&amp;#39;s world. Facebook, Google+, Medium—these are places that exist to make other people lots and lots of money. Sure, they can be great sources of social traffic, what happens when your needs (readers) and their needs (profit) don&amp;#39;t align anymore? How sure are you that a future algorithm change won&amp;#39;t completely wipe your work for your reader&amp;#39;s eyes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a big fan of analogies, and here&amp;#39;s the best one that comes to mind. Renting a home is great. Without forking over huge amounts of up-front capital, you can move yourself to a desirable part of town and live a happy life. Sure, you might be able to paint some walls, but most of the control is out of your hands. But that&amp;#39;s ok, you&amp;#39;re just living your life, and things are going great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then Monday rolls around and you get a call. Your place is being bulldozed at the end of the month to make way for a new shopping mall. Bye. Maybe you&amp;#39;ll be able to find a new place in the same area, maybe not. When you don&amp;#39;t own your space, you don&amp;#39;t get to decide what happens to your little corner of the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to reiterate the message—whatever you do, resist the urge to move all your content to a social platform. Just don&amp;#39;t do it. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Subdomain rot and the security implications</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re anything like us, you probably know all-to-well the excitement of trying out new hosted services, then linking them to a subdomain of your main domain. You might try out a platform like Desk and put it on help.domain.tld, then try another platform on support.domain.tld. And inevitably, you&amp;#39;ll find the one you like best and move on from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so many of us make the mistake of forgetting all the unused subdomains we have. On the surface, nothing on your site is any different, but then you start noticing the credit card statements filled with services you&amp;#39;re not actually using. Canceling them is easy, but then there&amp;#39;s the domain side. Even after you cancel the billing, your unused subdomain (let&amp;#39;s say help.domain.tld, which was on Desk) is still being linked to the platform, and when you go to the domain, you&amp;#39;re met with the default platform error message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing to worry about, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong, wrong, wrong. Because your subdomain is still being linked to the platform on the domain side, any not-so-well-meaning person can register for a Desk account and link it to the subdomain that&amp;#39;s already setup. Then, basically, they&amp;#39;re you. Everything they do with that Desk account looks legit, and theres really no way for you to notice because it&amp;#39;s all happening outside of your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a risk we&amp;#39;ve tried to keep under control with regular cleanups of our zone file, but we were reminded of it yesterday because of a post on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.detectify.com/post/100600514143/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-heroku-github-desk&quot;&gt;detectify blog&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, they also link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://redoctober.detectify.com&quot;&gt;quick tool&lt;/a&gt; that let&amp;#39;s you know if you&amp;#39;re in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you do anything today, be sure to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://redoctober.detectify.com&quot;&gt;the tool&lt;/a&gt;. We were sure to run it right away, and if you like to try new platforms even half as much as we do, you could save yourself a major headaches down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Nielson and Adobe are looking to rate the internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2014/10/nielsen-will-soon-rate-everything-web-videos-articles/&quot;&gt;From Wired:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nielsen ratings have long held huge sway over the business of television, but television isn’t like it used to be. So, on Tuesday, Nielsen announced that it’s expanding its ratings system to all kinds of digital content to give both its creators and advertisers a more meaningful way to measure popularity in the online era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most striking development in Adobe’s new system is that it’s designed for comparing disparate kinds of content. The new ratings, Nielsen says, can rank an online video next to a podcast next to an article. Unlike television or radio, the internet isn’t a medium that funnels just one format. The aim of Nielsen’s new ratings is to create a context to figure out what people care about online, regardless of what form it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a reminder that internet advertising is still in its infancy. It&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see what the internet looks like in 20 years, once the big media entities switch their primary funding from TV to the web. The last two lines of the article say it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old way made a lot of people in old media a lot of money. If someone can approximate the old way for new media, maybe more of that money will start rolling in, just like it used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Domain extension options for personal branding</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, personal branding is the hardest of all the branding types. Seriously. (How many failed aliases have you tried to use in the last decade? I&amp;#39;m at three.). But now that the new generic top-level domains have launched, getting your real name on the left side of the dot is easier than ever. So what domain extension do you want on the other side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking the right one can be tricky, and there are a number of things you should consider before making your choice. Let&amp;#39;s break down some of your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;.COM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious choice for your personal site is yourname.com, and that&amp;#39;s probably the choice I&amp;#39;d make if it were available to me. If your name is rare enough for this to even be an option, your only real consideration should be whether you should go with lastname.com or fullname.com. I personally prefer lastname.com, because email addresses like chris@hall.com look nicer than chris@chrishall.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;.CO and .ME&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; seem to be the next most common choices for personal sites. And in 2012, they were excellent choices, if only because they freed you from the confines of the .COM namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the flood of new domain extensions allow me to be picky, and I do have some concerns with these specific two. Starting with .CO, my primary concern is spelling errors—particularly with people unconsciously adding an &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; to .CO when sending emails. .ME is a little safer in that no one will mistake it for another extension, but I always wonder if people think .ME has an Apple affiliation due to the recently retired Mobile Me (I still regularly use my @me.com email address). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your local ccTLD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are super popular around the world (aside for the US), and they make for wonderful personal domain names. For example, if you&amp;#39;re a designer who does the bulk of your work in New Zealand, picking up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;.NZ&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;) domain name is a great choice. Due to popularity, many basic names will already be taken, but if your parents were adventurous types, there&amp;#39;s a good chance your name will be available (I desperately tried to rename myself Bowser as a child, and BowserHall is available in just about every extension).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Letters and phrases you identify with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very similar topic was brought up recently on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8466018&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the replies fits perfectly into this category. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the .gg TLD. My personal site is bram.gg and my email is hello@bram.gg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.gg is my favorite TLD, and the most underrated. It&amp;#39;s expensive enough that the domain you want probably isn&amp;#39;t taken, but cheap enough that it&amp;#39;s worth the price if it&amp;#39;s something you care about. &amp;quot;gg&amp;quot; is also a common phrase in gaming subculture, meaning &amp;quot;good game&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now going with something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gg-channel-island-domain-name-registration-for-guernsey&quot;&gt;.GG&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;quot;good game&amp;quot; is a viable option, but I&amp;#39;d be a little concerned about longevity. Let&amp;#39;s say you keep this domain for 20 years—are you going to be ok with &amp;quot;good game&amp;quot; when you&amp;#39;re 40? 50? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, a similar concern goes for extensions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wtf&quot;&gt;.WTF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rocks&quot;&gt;.ROCKS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ninja&quot;&gt;.NINJA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cool&quot;&gt;.COOL&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re a 40-year-old who genuinely, unquestionably rocks, then go for it, but if you&amp;#39;re 17 going with a .NINJA domain, will you be cool with it when you&amp;#39;re 37?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Career specific&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new gTLDs also allow for people to self-identify with their careers. So if you&amp;#39;re a photographer, you could use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos&quot;&gt;.photos&lt;/a&gt; extension. Or if you&amp;#39;re an engineer, you could go with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-engineer&quot;&gt;.engineer&lt;/a&gt; domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going for longer, more specific domains, there are two things you should consider. First, how confident are you that you&amp;#39;ll stay in that career forever? Are you sure you&amp;#39;re not going to quit your job and become a brewmaster (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&quot;&gt;.BEER&lt;/a&gt; in the next five years? And second, be mindful of length. There&amp;#39;s an American football player named Michael Hoomanawanui, and if he retires and becomes a photographer, hoomanawanui.photography probably isn&amp;#39;t his best option for a domain name (24 characters is incredibly long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Domain hacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain hacks won&amp;#39;t work for everyone, but if you want to get clever, you could do a lot worse than finding the ccTLD that fits into your name. Some common name-enders are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.ES&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/am-armenian-domain-name-registration-for-armenia&quot;&gt;.AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria&quot;&gt;.AT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium&quot;&gt;.BE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ch-swiss-domain-name-registration-for-switzerland&quot;&gt;.CH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/my-malaysian-domain-name-registration-for-malaysia&quot;&gt;.MY&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sh-domain-name-registration-for-saint-helena&quot;&gt;.SH&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, .LL (ha.ll) isn&amp;#39;t available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, just about anything you choose will be fine as long as you stick with it (isn&amp;#39;t that always the lesson?). The goal of a personal domain is for people to be able to find you, and if you stay in the same place long enough, they likely will. Just know that no matter what domain extension you go with, it&amp;#39;ll be better than sending people to Facebook or LinkedIn to discover who you are. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An interview with Dan Tocchini, Founder and CEO of The Grid</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has come a long way since the &amp;quot;dawn of the blogs&amp;quot; in the early 90&amp;#39;s, but as Anil Dash &lt;a href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/2014/09/15-lessons-from-15-years-of-blogging.html&quot;&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;The tools for blogging have been extraordinarily stagnant. And this stagnation is particularly egregious when we consider that almost every common behavior on the big social networks is a subset of what we originally thought blogging might be.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting the future of blogging—and website creation in general—is a tall task, but there&amp;#39;s one upcoming platform that seems to be dreaming bigger than the rest—&lt;a href=&quot;https://thegrid.io/&quot;&gt;The Grid&lt;/a&gt;. So I had a chat with The Grid&amp;#39;s founder and CEO, Dan Tocchini (who also happens to be an awesome iwantmyname customer), to find out what the new platform is all about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So first, tell me what The Grid is? Who&amp;#39;s it for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; The Grid is the first AI platform for designing websites. So basically, you throw content in—images, videos, text—and the output is an elegant website that&amp;#39;s as easy to update as a social network. But it&amp;#39;s constantly evolving itself, trying to figure out the best possible layout—to go above and beyond the best drag-and-drop builders out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who&amp;#39;s it for? I believe in designing products for humans, not businesses. The initial market is definitely the creators, the artists, the entrepreneurs—people who have the most immediate need for websites. I think that as time goes, it&amp;#39;s going to be for everyone. For humans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So you mentioned that it&amp;#39;s as easy as your social network. Do you see The Grid becoming a social replacement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; Well I think social...&amp;quot;social&amp;quot;...media is a temporary replacement for websites, because websites are so hard to do anything with. So in that sense, when there&amp;#39;s a good-enough website, it&amp;#39;ll be inherently social. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think things like Pinterest and Facebook and Twitter have really bloomed because of the lack of good-enough website solutions—the lack of a good enough place to put your content, so we&amp;#39;ve all settled to build someone else&amp;#39;s website. At the end of the day, your Facebook page is just part of someone else&amp;#39;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s one thing I think traditional websites lack, and that&amp;#39;s the network effect you get from something like Facebook. You go on and you have a built in audience of X number of people. Now I see that The Grid has a kind of newsfeed built in—tell me how that works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; So if you think about it, what makes things like Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter social? Even Tumblr. Really, it&amp;#39;s the newsfeed—the fact that I don&amp;#39;t have to go and click on every single person&amp;#39;s profile to see what&amp;#39;s going on. And right now on websites, what are you going to do? Bookmark it? RSS died, and for good reason. It&amp;#39;s hard for sites to know how many followers they have, and you don&amp;#39;t really know if someone likes something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So The Grid is hopefully going to solve the entire website problem. Not just the creation of sites, but the entire network around them. So you&amp;#39;ll be able to follow websites that are created on The Grid as well as websites that aren&amp;#39;t created on The Grid. You&amp;#39;ll have a newsfeed of all the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How will that look?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; We have some prototypes laid out. It looks a little like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegrid.io/&quot;&gt;The Grid website&lt;/a&gt;—our site is the first website we&amp;#39;ve really let loose in the wild that&amp;#39;s fully built with our AI system. The newsfeed will look a lot like that—it won&amp;#39;t be as linear and monotone as the newsfeeds you&amp;#39;re used to right now. There will be some variation in the scrolling experience, and we&amp;#39;ll let things take up space to create rhythm as you scroll. It&amp;#39;ll feel more like a website, just without the branded header at the top. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So speaking of design and how websites are built, is this the end of web design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;Laughter&gt; Really, it begins with a good designer&amp;#39;s brain. We&amp;#39;re doing our best to build a deep API so people can create layout filters, but the goal is for designers to take the things they&amp;#39;re doing and really design a section of the layout. Get it totally right, and then give it constraints, or high level rules, for when that section of the layout should be used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, on The Grid&amp;#39;s website, we literally just threw in some Markdown files, Word docs, and images and it went. We didn&amp;#39;t choose the sections, or the order. Other than the top section, all the colors were extracted from the content provided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example. There&amp;#39;s one section of the page that has a girl with crazy hair, and on the left there&amp;#39;s text on top of the image, and that text doesn&amp;#39;t have a background. What you can do is design a section that says, here&amp;#39;s text on top of an image, and the text doesn&amp;#39;t need a background because this image has an area of low contrast that&amp;#39;s suitable to put text on top. So we give those API&amp;#39;s to designers so they can create rules like that, then the way the content is marshaled in is determined by them. So we&amp;#39;re not replacing designers, we&amp;#39;re replacing the task of manually putting content into rigid templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing designers would just be crazy. Maybe in 100 years. Right now, that&amp;#39;s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So what happens if you see something in The Grid that you don&amp;#39;t like—something that&amp;#39;s in a place it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; What&amp;#39;s interesting is, we&amp;#39;re really getting away from websites looking one way. When you come back to it, it might look a little different—even if you didn&amp;#39;t add any new content. And there might be subtle variations. One layout might have things on the left, then next time they could be on the right. So there isn&amp;#39;t just one way your site looks. But we do have a way to say, &amp;quot;so that&amp;#39;s crap,&amp;quot; but that&amp;#39;s really at a high level.  We don&amp;#39;t give control over individual sections, because the moment you start doing that, your site becomes brittle—we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to A/B test or go beyond what you manually configure. That&amp;#39;s not the world we want to be in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we want is for you to treat The Grid as a designer. You send your content to the designer, they come up with some ideas, then send it back. If you don&amp;#39;t like it, you can say &amp;quot;give me something else,&amp;quot; but you shouldn&amp;#39;t tell your designer to make the logo bigger. If you&amp;#39;re dealing with a good designer, that&amp;#39;s just not going to be ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk a little about A/B testing.  I read that it&amp;#39;s automated. Does that mean the AI will be able to tweak your content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; What happens is that the layout engine &amp;quot;solves&amp;quot; your design. It takes a piece of content and creates a suitable solution. With the types of algorithms we&amp;#39;re using, there&amp;#39;s ambiguity in the results—many just-as-suitable solutions to your content. Your content could be computed as 15 different layouts, all of which look equally good to us. So the system goes through and figures out which one is best by testing them each. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t go through and change words of anything, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; No, but there&amp;#39;s one thing we really want to do, and that&amp;#39;s add the ability to create alternate titles for layout solution sets—so you could have multiple titles and see which one converts best. The real idea is to have A/B testing that scales, because everyone talks about A/B testing, but no one really does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A/B testing always makes me think of e-commerce, which seems to be a pretty big focus. How is it going to work? From what I gather, you just drop items in and set a price, then magic happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah. So first of all, e-commerce is a very big deal. When we first started this thing, we knew that to really solve a website problem, we&amp;#39;d have to make e-commerce a priority. It&amp;#39;s critical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on The Grid, instead of having a rigid content hierarchy, where you have videos, images, products, galleries, shipping carts, this, and that—instead, you just post stuff. And if you put a price on it, it&amp;#39;s a product, or you could link it to a product. If you add a bunch of images and a bunch of videos, it&amp;#39;s a gallery. We&amp;#39;re purposefully keeping what you can do with commerce very flexible and ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Can you expand on that a bit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; We&amp;#39;re very ambitious with what we&amp;#39;re going after, and there are a lot of things around commerce and the social connections within commerce that I think are going to be some of the most critical things when we&amp;#39;re at scale. It&amp;#39;s one of those things we can&amp;#39;t talk about too much right now, but we&amp;#39;re definitely going to be pushing the envelope on not just the website creation, but the connections you make with websites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little further out, we&amp;#39;ll be looking at financial connections—having money seamlessly just go between people. Like, when you send a friend to someone&amp;#39;s website to see a video, but you happen to buy something through that connection, maybe a wallet would go up. There are a lot of really cool things we want to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then speaking really far down the line, to me, these are really just all 2D interface problems. Then things get crazy. &amp;lt; laughs &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Last question. How big do you think this office is going to get (the room is small, but well designed, with three people plugging away at workstations)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; You know, we&amp;#39;re very non-local. Our team is about 20 people now, and most of the guys are in Europe. We&amp;#39;re in, I think, eight time zones. I kind of like the non-traditional office thing. We get together every couple months in a different city around the world and rent the best Airbnb place we can find, and we just hack together for awhile without all the life distractions. It&amp;#39;s really cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we&amp;#39;ve been to Berlin a couple times, Florence, Toronto—they&amp;#39;ve come out to San Francisco a couple times.  I think it what would be killer to continue that, but we&amp;#39;ll probably end up having a base here in San Francisco and a base in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that wraps it up (I&amp;#39;ll spare you the pleasantries). &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegrid.io/&quot;&gt;The Grid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s v1 release is currently scheduled for late Spring 2015, but you can be a &amp;quot;Founding Member&amp;quot; right now, which locks you in at $8/mo (instead of $25/mo), seven custom sites, and a few other nifty perks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the future, y&amp;#39;all. Embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Need to know: requesting personal information from your audience</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, data is king. Big Data, data mining, data-driven decisions. It gives the impression that when you&amp;#39;re building your online presence, whether a community, business, or audience (or all of the above), you need to learn as much about those you interact with as possible. Especially before you engage in any important decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing everything (ideally with the first impression/interaction) should give us the insights we need to develop the perfect product, grow the most engaged audience, and pretty much be our crystal ball, right? Well, not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start off by reframing things. Imagine yourself on the other side of the equation for a moment. Because... well, you are. Every day. Every time you read an article online, buy something, subscribe to a newsletter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to get something done online, you want it to be fast, clear, and not ask more from you than is relevant or necessary. It&amp;#39;s a pretty common experience to start the process to get something, like an e-book, and abandon it because there&amp;#39;s just no way they need your phone number, birth date, employment history, and blood type in addition to your name and email address. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, from the other side, the more information a company or individual has, the more there is to analyze and target. It also implies a stronger interest in the product or service. Gotta fill out those customer profiles, see where the low-hanging fruit and high-growth verticals are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot easier to develop trust than to rebuild it, though. So it&amp;#39;s wise to start slowly when getting to know an audience, and work your way up. It&amp;#39;s no different than meeting people in person. We start out with small talk and introductions -- your name, perhaps what you do, and how you know the host of the party or are tied to the group putting on the event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit awkward and uncomfortable if someone you just met launches into the TMI (too much information), like their unemployment or health woes, very personal interests, or starts asking excessively personal questions of you. It makes you more inclined to cut bait and flee and to dive into conversation and relationship-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with most things, there&amp;#39;s a spectrum of attitudes to consider. Some people do their best to be entirely anonymous online. They won&amp;#39;t easily provide &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; information, and will extensively question why you need every detail you request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other people, on the other end, unfortunately, are far too open and trusting, and don&amp;#39;t even practice basic privacy and security protection. (Never EVER email passwords or credit card details to ANYONE, including us.) They don&amp;#39;t understand how easy it would be to use their information—for nefarious purposes as easily as to help them, which is probably what they were requesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some things you can offer people without requiring or requesting anything, like great blog content, for example. But if you want to subscribe to a blog to be sure you don&amp;#39;t miss anything, then a bit of information is required. If you want to buy something, a bit more information is required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always segment, too. For example, have a main newsletter, product news, or blog subscriber list, and then add special interest lists that people can opt into. This helps you target your communications and sales strategies better, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people on both sides of the communications equation, a good question to ask regularly is: &lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s in it for me, and what&amp;#39;s in it for them?&lt;/em&gt; You want there to be some balance there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people do trust you with their information, be as careful with it as you would be with your own. Practice the Golden Rule. If you wouldn&amp;#39;t want a bunch of unsolicited emails after signing up for a newsletter, then don&amp;#39;t do that to your subscribers. Sending a confirmation and welcome? Sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be clear when people are signing up or purchasing from you how you intend to use their information, and when. Yes, doing business with someone gives you certain communications rights, but don&amp;#39;t abuse that. Just because you can doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should. And keep up to date on spam laws and your responsibilities. The penalties can be pretty stiff, often deservedly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, double opt-in is a bit more effort for you, and might net a few fewer contacts, but those ones will be much more engaged and definitely want to hear from you, so overall it&amp;#39;s a much bigger win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone says they don&amp;#39;t want to hear from you, remove them from your list. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to inquire as to why, but most likely they just aren&amp;#39;t interested. Accept it and do it quickly. (And make unsubscribe and related links easy to find.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also goes without saying that when you do contact people, make it relevant to them. This will maintain the goodwill, and be more likely to keep them interested in hearing from you. This could be about your work, products, or services. It could be able cool stuff you heard about that they might also be interested in. It could be to ask them for feedback or input. (See the above paragraph on segmenting your communications as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Internet is a pretty social place, and it&amp;#39;s provided myriad new ways for people to interact, learn, and do business. (We&amp;#39;re huge fans.) :) But the Internet runs on people and our choices and actions. Having an agenda or being invisible is no reason not to maintain our manners, good judgement, and smart business practices. In face, I&amp;#39;d argue it&amp;#39;s even more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know what your best communications strategies are for getting to know and keeping in touch with your audience, community, or customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Zoho is a bootstrapped success story we can get behind</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From PandoDaily, in an article titled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pando.com/2014/10/14/anti-burn-how-bootstrapped-zoho-survived-two-tech-bubbles-and-became-a-massive-success/&quot;&gt;Anti-burn: How bootstrapped Zoho survived two tech bubbles and became a massive success&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley has been up in arms of late over burn rates. With private companies raising larger rounds at higher valuations than ever before and chasing broader market opportunities than possible in the past, it’s no surprise that entrepreneurs are spending at an unprecedented rate to grow as fast as they can. But, despite these understandable circumstances, several of the industry’s most respected investors have raised a red flag on the issue, arguing that it’s a symptom of good times company building that could leave a ton of companies dangerously exposed when market conditions inevitably shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those arguing that spending with reckless abandon is the only way to build the kind of massive, high value businesses that the venture model demands, there are counterpoints available across the Valley. One such business is Zoho, the 18-year-old enterprise software company that has bootstrapped itself to hundreds of millions in revenue, and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an active user of Zoho Mail (Zoho Mail, Discussions, Sites, and Wiki are all in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt;) , I&amp;#39;ll say two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Zoho platform is extremely easy to use, and I almost always recommend it to friends over Google Apps. Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but I generally like to go with platforms that have straightforward business models. Zoho sells solutions, Google sells data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a bootstrapped company ourselves, we love companies that are in control of their own destiny. Here&amp;#39;s a good quote from the PandoDaily article— &amp;quot;When companies grow too fast they never figure out management and cultural issues, they just pile on layers of management,” Vembu says. “We just learned on the job – trial by fire. We made lots of mistakes, but no major ones. That’s the good thing, when you’re small, you can correct them. And the process of making mistakes is crucial to the process of learning. Besides, most VCs today have never built a company. They’re mostly MBAs, with at best one exit. And survivorship bias means they’ve probably never navigated a recession anyway.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>StartUp shares the agony of naming a company, plus my short list of naming rules</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-15-startup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;StartUp&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a podcast listener, Alex Blumberg&amp;#39;s new show, StartUp, just might be the best new show around. Here&amp;#39;s the synopsis, from the StartUp about page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m Alex Blumberg. My experience is in public radio, as a producer for This American Life and as a co-founder of the business-economics series Planet Money. After years of reporting on other people&amp;#39;s businesses, I decided to start my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show follows what happens next – my difficult journey from man to businessman. It&amp;#39;s a classic start-up story, but one that&amp;#39;s recorded in real time. I&amp;#39;ve documented disastrous pitches to investors, difficult conversations with my wife, and tense negotiations with my co-founder. The result is an honest, transparent account of something that happens all the time, but that we can rarely listen in on: starting a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d definitely recommend starting at the beginning, but the latest episode, titled &amp;quot;How To Name Your Company&amp;quot; is a fantastic look at how hard branding really is. Give it a listen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172008630&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=true&amp;amp;show_comments=false&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote an article asking &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html&quot;&gt;whether domain extensions matter anymore&lt;/a&gt;, and this episode really got me thinking. If you&amp;#39;re creating a company with global business aspirations, do you need to get a .com?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the episode, Alex Blumberg mentions a handful of tech companies that end with &amp;quot;ly&amp;quot;—and that was due to the brief popularity of the .ly domain extension at the end of the 00&amp;#39;s. Bit.ly is one that sticks in my head, and even though the .ly domain now forwards to a .com, the reason for the change was more to do with .ly being the ccTLD for Libya (government instability is never good) than the domain not being successful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, if you&amp;#39;re a new business, the most important aspect is credibility. In 2014, .com is still probably the most credible extension for the average consumer, but we&amp;#39;re at a point now where people probably aren&amp;#39;t going to blink at .io, .co, .club, or really any extension that doesn&amp;#39;t make your name seem spammy or computer generated. So YOURNAME.club probably works, while MISPELLEDNAME.club or YOURNAME567.club probably won&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to create a small set of &amp;quot;rules to name by,&amp;quot; this would be it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;re free to use any domain extension (and there are a ton of good options now), but people are trained to be wary of salesy or spammy names. Use your best judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do, make sure your name is spelled correctly. Intentional vowel dropping is fine, but if your domain is &amp;quot;newzeland.TLD,&amp;quot; people are rightly going to question your legitimacy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t go to lengths to make your brand name fit into the .com namespace. If your brand name is &amp;quot;Name,&amp;quot; you can add one word to it, max. hearName.com, Namemedia.com, useName.com—all ok. Nametryitnow.com is not. We have 226 new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; available now, and so many more country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) on top of that, so take advantage!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, five months on, where are we? Well, I&amp;#39;m particularly happy with the results so far, and this is why I wanted to outline the approach that I&amp;#39;ve taken from a content, social, and SEO perspective to get results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of results, here&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 1 rankings in Google for the terms pescetarian, pescetarian blog, pescetarian recipes and pescetarian meals. Go ahead, Google it if you don&amp;#39;t believe me ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4,700+ followers on our Facebook page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average engagement on one of our Facebook posts will often result in around 100 likes, 5-15 comments, 20-50 shares and 100-300 clicks through to the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;850+ Twitter followers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500+ Pinterest followers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;550 double opt-in email subscribers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30,000+ unique visits to the blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15,000+ unique visits coming from social media traffic alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;65,000+ backlinks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#39;s early in our campaign, I&amp;#39;m going to share how we&amp;#39;ve achieved what we have so far and give you as much actionable information as to how you can go out and replicate the early success that we&amp;#39;ve had. This will include the exact strategies that I&amp;#39;ve implemented, the tools that I&amp;#39;ve used and any tips for accelerating growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On personal blogs, I&amp;#39;ve been a pretty strong proponent of what I call the John Gruber method—if you consistently write something worthwhile, people will eventually come. But if you have time, dedication, and resources, the &amp;quot;people will eventually come&amp;quot; part can sometimes be changed to &amp;quot;people will come very soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is, there&amp;#39;s a real science behind generating blog traffic, and it involves some combination of great content, SEO, social media, email, and a open eye to new ways to promote what you write. You just have to know where to start—and you could do a lot worse than starting with the article above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing of particular interest was the fact that the blog the author created is using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kitchen&quot;&gt;.kitchen&lt;/a&gt; domain extension. The author wrote, &amp;quot;we needed to have the term pescetarian within it. We finally decided on going with one of the new .kitchen TLDs that were made available.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proof that using a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domain (gTLD)&lt;/a&gt; can make for a successful blog? I&amp;#39;d say so. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why domain extensions still matter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname chief writer Chris asked an interesting question the other day: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html&quot;&gt;“Do domain extensions really matter anymore?”&lt;/a&gt;. This is something I’ve also been thinking about, and here are three areas I believe they still do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In non-dotcom land, i.e. anywhere but the US, domain extensions can give people a hint as to where you are doing business. That’s why country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .NZ (New Zealand) or .UK (United Kingdom) are often preferred by local visitors over .COM and other generic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example here are some interesting facts from the .nz registry’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getyourselfonline.co.nz/2014-nz-domain-name-research-report&quot;&gt;“2014 .nz Domain Name Research Report”&lt;/a&gt; to back this up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly all New Zealanders (89%) look for .nz domain names all or some of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More people (79% up from 71% in 2012) filter their searches to get New Zealand results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers trust .nz websites mainly because they are local.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All consumers expect .nz sites to ship at reasonable cost, be easy to contact and to have legal cover, compared with .com sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even if you are an international company offering services to  customers in multiple countries it could make sense to advertise your site using the local ccTLD for both consumer trust and search engine visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New gTLDs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; hit the market. These were specifically launched to have more meaningful domain extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the following three examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; for people sharing common interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&quot;&gt;.DIRECTORY&lt;/a&gt; for listings and collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt; which is completely self-explanatory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it easier to guess what’s behind a web address using one of these TLDs than a random .com domain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re only at the beginning of this internet address expansion and closed or restricted namespaces may further increase the importance of domain extensions. For example, the decision by the city of New York to only allow the registration of .NYC domains if you meet their address requirements could result in it becoming the most popular choice for local businesses. There are also plans for &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/05/my-own-private-internet-secure-tld-floated-as-bad-guy-free-zone/&quot;&gt;ultra-secure namespaces such as .SECURE&lt;/a&gt; or .BANK which would only be available to approved parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain extensions also still matter because they allow you to own your web address. Without the Domain Name System there would be no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s one of the reasons why I am excited about aforementioned new top-level domains. If there is a wider selection of domain extensions and you have more choice in picking a name you like (try finding something you really, really like in .COM) it means  you are more likely to take control of your web address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the following about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/i-want-my-name-or-how-you-can-own-your-online-identity-with-domains.html&quot;&gt;owning your domain&lt;/a&gt; 5 years ago which still holds true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domains [have been around] 25 years(!) now and there’s no sign that they will go away anytime soon. A domain name is the only address that you can really own and control. You register it, you pay for it and you use it the way you want. It’s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s changed is that we’re 30 years in now. And here’s to the next 10!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Do domain extensions really matter anymore?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Pando Daily, in an article titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://pando.com/2014/10/09/whats-in-a-name-the-fading-tyranny-of-dot-com/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;What’s In A Name? The fading tyranny of dot com&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone like Michael Heyward, who co-founded anonymous social networking app Whisper in 2012, as a mobile first company, he says, there was not an ounce of trepidation at not having the Whisper.com domain name. (Whisper.com itself is a junk address, filled with spam links.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heyward says that 99 percent of Whisper’s exposure comes from its app. The company has a Whisper.sh landing page, to showcase popular posts from the app and publish legal and company information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Americans spend more time in apps than they do using the Internet on desktop. With social media sites becoming a greater engine for content discovery, new sites such as Quartz are popping up that don’t really even have an official homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the declining need for .com addresses, I was driving home on the freeway this morning and saw a giant billboard that read something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save big on auto and home insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call xxxxxxxxxx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VerbBrandNameAdverb.TLD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine me, cruising down the road at 75 mph (120 kph), glancing up at a billboard to memorize not only a phone number, but an excessively long domain name because the company refused to use anything but .com. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A savvy marketing manager would advise them to shorten that domain in any way possible, but a really savvy marketing manager would tell them to nix the website from the billboard altogether. If you have three seconds to get a message across, the primary goal is to get the brand name to stick. If the brand name sticks, people (even the internet-phobic) will find you on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can probably count the number of times I&amp;#39;ve typed in a full domain name this week on one hand. Search, social, links—that&amp;#39;s how people get around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thought. I was at an event the other day, and someone asked me where I worked. The crowd wasn&amp;#39;t particularly tech savvy, so I figured saying &amp;quot;iwantmyname&amp;quot; would raise some eyebrows. Instead, I said &amp;quot;I work for a domain registrar called iwantmyname—you should check out our site!&amp;quot; Reflexively, the guy pulled out his phone and typed in &amp;quot;iwantmyname.&amp;quot; A click later, and there he was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I didn&amp;#39;t need to say, &amp;quot;I work for iwantmyname... go to www.iwantmyname.com.&amp;quot; If you have a memorable brand name and a website, people will find you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Grid — AI websites that design themselves</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXA4-5x31V0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write content for a living—always have, probably always will. So when I&amp;#39;m looking to create websites (which I do quite often), I try to take advantage of platforms that let me do my thing without needing too much help from designers and developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So imagine the look on my face when I read this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not another do-it-yourself website builder. The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. As your needs grow, it evolves with you, effortlessly adapting to your needs. Want to add e-commerce? Social feeds? A different layout? The Grid just takes care of it. This is not a website builder. This is your personal AI web developer. Its first masterpiece is the website you&amp;#39;re looking at right now. Its next one could be yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;??? I think the expression could adequately be described as a blend of wide-eyed and slack-jawed. Needless to say, I&amp;#39;m now Founding Member #1173.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to geek out on new platforms as much as I do, definitely check out The Grid&amp;#39;s website for yourself. Version 1.0 is set to launch in spring 2015, but if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegrid.io/#1173&quot;&gt;sign up for a membership now&lt;/a&gt; **, you&amp;#39;ll be locked in at $8/mo (as opposed to the normal $25/mo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Just to be totally transparent, when I signed up, the email receipt had a bit at the bottom, in bold caps, that said, &amp;quot;INVITE 3 FRIENDS AND WE’LL PAY FOR YOUR MEMBERSHIP.&amp;quot; So if you use the link above, you&amp;#39;re indirectly supporting my &amp;quot;awesome-new-web-platform&amp;quot; addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Unknown life lessons from diving into .com history</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I may be promoting everything that&amp;#39;s wrong with the internet today, but I kind of love a good list. And today I came across a great one—a list of the 100 oldest .com domain names, which go all the way back to March 15, 1985. Here are the first ten, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.domainholdings.com/recent-sales/100-oldest-domain-names/&quot;&gt;Domain Holdings&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; March 15, 1985 - Symbolics.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; April 24, 1985 - BBN.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; May 24, 1985 - Think.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; July 11, 1985 - MCC.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; September 30, 1985 - DEC.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; November 7, 1985 - Northrop.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; January 9, 1986 - Xerox.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; January 17, 1986 - SRI.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; March 3, 1986 - HP.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 5, 1986 - Bellcore.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down the list you get a who&amp;#39;s-who of major tech companies: IBM.com, Intel.com, GE.com, AMD.com, Tandy.com, Apple.com. It&amp;#39;s an interesting list, but thinking of what the world was like in 1985, I was craving context. The stories behind the domains that were registered before Tim Berners-Lee even conceived of a &amp;quot;World Wide Web.&amp;quot; So I headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://symbolics.com/&quot;&gt;symbolics.com&lt;/a&gt; to see what I could find (did the site still exist?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s a strange site, clearly not related to the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Symbolics&quot;&gt;Symbolics, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in any way, with an odd, side-scrolling homepage that showed little in the way of content. So I went to the FAQ to find out what&amp;#39;s up, and this little gem appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q. What is the point of this site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A. To offer curious Internet visitors an interesting way to navigate through historic Internet facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh. Next stop, the about page. At the top, it calls out that the site is now owned by a &amp;quot;small investor group&amp;quot; in Dallas, TX, and that there are advertising opportunities available (on the home page I&amp;#39;m guessing). But the story that follows makes it clear that the owner, Aron Maystedt, is really just hanging onto the domain because it&amp;#39;s a collectible—like a first-edition book. Or perhaps the &lt;em&gt;first ever&lt;/em&gt; book. Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://symbolics.com/about-symbolics/&quot;&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. How did I come to own the first domain name registered on the Internet? Symbolics.com was registered on March 15, 1985. I was 5 years old. I like to tell everyone that I had incredible foresight as a toddler. But that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a bit about the Symbolics Computer Corporation. These are the people who registered the name in 1985, and they were a company way ahead of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original Symbolics company pioneered computer development. Symbolics designed and manufactured a line of Lisp machines, single-user computers optimized to run the Lisp programming language. The Lisp Machine was the first commercially available “workstation” (although that word had not yet been coined). Symbolics also made significant advances in software technology, and offered one of the premier software development environments of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter me, in 2009. I had always known (well, since the late 90s) that Symbolics.com was the first domain name registered on the Internet. It was a goal of mine to acquire one of the first few names ever registered. I know that others before me had reached out to Symbolics, and inquired about the purchase price of the domain name. For whatever reason, my timing was perfect (thank you Lord) and I contacted Symbolics right about the time they actually started considering selling the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story was amusing, but it didn&amp;#39;t have any of the wonder of being the first one to register a domain name. I thought I&amp;#39;d try to find something at the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.symbolics-dks.com/&quot;&gt;Symbolics site&lt;/a&gt;, but no luck. Nothing to be found. SF Gate did run a good article back in 2010, titled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/25-years-of-com-domain-names-3270287.php&quot;&gt;25 years of .com domain names&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, where they contacted the Symbolics founders for the story. Unfortunately, they &amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t even remember the event.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How funny is that. They registered the very first .com, and it didn&amp;#39;t even register in their memories. There&amp;#39;s a lesson in there somewhere, I just don&amp;#39;t know what it is yet. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.NYC is out, but you need to be a New Yorker to register</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Good news New Yorkers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt; is out today! But if you&amp;#39;re not a New Yorker, fuhgetaboudit (I had to). Like some other top-level domains, the registry behind .NYC has placed restrictions on the domain to ensure only New Yorkers have access. So here&amp;#39;s the scoop, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ownit.nyc/policies/nyc_nexus_policy.php&quot;&gt;ownit.nyc&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registrants in .NYC must be either:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a natural person whose primary place of domicile is a valid physical address in the City of New York (“Nexus Category 1”); or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an entity or organization that has a physical street address in the City of New York (“Nexus Category 2”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The existence of a P.O. Box address in the City of New York shall not qualify for purposes of meeting the Nexus Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registrants must agree in their Agreement with their Registrar and/or Reseller, whichever applicable, that they are in compliance with all relevant Federal, New York State and New York City laws, including the tax requirements for conducting business via the Internet. Registrants may find more information about compliance with the City tax laws at the City of New York Department of Finance’s website (currently at www.nyc.gov/finance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registrants must remain in compliance with the applicable Nexus Category for the entire period of such domain name’s registration by the registrant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registrants may not license, sub-delegate or otherwise transfer .NYC domain names to third parties that otherwise fail to meet the requirements of this Nexus Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, to get a .NYC domain, you have to have a valid address in NYC (business or residential), and you need to keep that address (or another NYC address) for the duration of the ownership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, when domains have this many restrictions on registration, we simply choose not to offer them. It creates challenges for us, and ultimately, makes the lives of our customers unnecessarily difficult. But in this case, we&amp;#39;ve received so much interest in the domain that we&amp;#39;ve decided to sell it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about .NYC, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ownit.nyc/&quot;&gt;.NYC registry&lt;/a&gt; has a ton of information about the extension and its uses, so you may be able to answer some of your more specific questions there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest complaints with Squarespace as a platform has been how clunky it is to get around. If you&amp;#39;re reading a page and even want to add a single sentence, you have to hit Esc, log-in (if you&amp;#39;re not already), find the page you&amp;#39;re trying to edit, double-click for the stupid Markdown editor (I&amp;#39;ll go to great lengths to not use WYSIWYG), make the edit, hit save, then go back to the page to see the changes. But now there&amp;#39;s on-page editing, which will hopefully cut out all the excess steps (and I&amp;#39;m praying to the internet gods for an on-screen Markdown editor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from a big-picture perspective, Wired hit the nail on the head with their headline, &amp;quot;The New Squarespace Is a UX Dream That Eliminates the Backend Entirely&amp;quot;. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2014/10/new-squarespace-ux-dream-eliminates-backend-entirely/&quot;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To streamline 7, Squarespace did away with most of the tabs and buttons, to instead let users edit in real time. I took the beta version for a spin: After jumping from Squarespace 6 to 7, my homescreen had a rectangular rendering of my site as it would appear on a screen. (You can view sites in smartphone and tablet layout too.) The main navigation tabs stay off to the left, but when I want to edit, say, the typography of a header, I click on that header and am presented with the necessary tools to tinker color and kerning. Before, you had to click your way through a trial-and-error process of figuring out which drop down tab applied to each graphic on the page, and then toggle back and forth between preview and edit to get the aesthetics just right. On 7, the changes appear instantly, true to format, before you exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Apps integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an integrated Gmail account isn&amp;#39;t a necessity, but I sure do like when things are convenient. With this, you could theoretically start a new brand, launch a website, and send out the obligatory &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; emails in just a few hours College dorm businesses are about to explode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope though is that you won&amp;#39;t have to use the free domain Squarespace provides to work the custom email address. For one, Squarespace only offers .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info, or .mobi domains, leaving out all the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;. But the more pressing issue is that when you keep your domain name with your host, you&amp;#39;re kind of at the whim of the platform you&amp;#39;re on. If it goes under, or you decide to move to another platform, it&amp;#39;s on you to transfer that domain out before the domain simply vanishes. Also, if you own a number of domains, having them all in one place (secure behind a wall of 2FA) is much more convenient than spreading domains out across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com/seven/faq&quot;&gt;Squarespace 7 FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, they write, &amp;quot;Google Apps accounts cost $5/user month. To get started with Google Apps integration, click Email under the Settings menu in your website manager. Note that you must be on a paying site and have connected a domain in order to gain access to Google Apps.&amp;quot; Looks like I&amp;#39;ll be keeping my email address and integrated tools separate for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New designs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-08-squarespace-cover-splash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cover Pages&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching from Squarespace 5 to Squarespace 6 was a pretty big leap, but the biggest change what the quality of the templates. Squarespace 7 doesn&amp;#39;t quite have that big of a jump, but there are 15 new designs to choose from. And for personal branding sites, the new Cover Pages tool looks kind of awesome (although I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to spend a hefty monthly fee to host a landing page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And one thing I don&amp;#39;t personally need. Getty Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get this out of the way first—I&amp;#39;m in no way trying to say that paid photography is a bad thing. If you&amp;#39;re opening a restaurant, a store, or just building something neat, I&amp;#39;d be the first person to recommend hiring an awesome photographer to capture the mood and the feel. But if you&amp;#39;re just looking for a massive picture of, say, New York to fill up your home page, there&amp;#39;s no reason to spend $10 for a Getty image. Just go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;, or any of the other great new &lt;a href=&quot;http://thestocks.im/&quot;&gt;stock photography sites&lt;/a&gt;, and pick something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$10 isn&amp;#39;t a bad price for professional photography though. I guess if you find a need for it, this Getty partnership is a good deal. Just be sure to scour the free stock image sites first—they&amp;#39;re better than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mou might hit 1.0 after all</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-07-mou.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mou&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started writing in Markdown, one of the first editors to draw me in was &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/tools-we-use-mou-for-writing.html&quot;&gt;Mou&lt;/a&gt; (you know, after I got sick of writing solely in TextEdit). It was cleaner and faster than many of the editors out there, but what really excited me was the side-by-side Markdown editing and rendering. I loved the fact that when I created a link, I could see it instantly formed in the right pane—and if I fudged it up somehow, it was easy to find the error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then Mou decided the development of the app was too taxing, tried to sell it, then kind of stopped supporting it after no offers were made. It was a sad day for Mou fans, and many of us scattered to various apps. For me, I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with MacDown as a replacement for the Mou experience and Byword for more of a pure writing tool, but still find myself using Mou from time to time—just for the nostalgia (or because I still have it as my default app for opening .md files).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I recently found that Chen Luo, the developer of Mou, was looking to build a team to continue the app&amp;#39;s development, I was thrilled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you&quot;&gt;From indiegogo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mou has been in beta for years, it was once Chen Luo&amp;#39;s personal sparetime project. After 3 years of development, more than 300,000 people are using Mou, and this number is keep increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Chen has never thought of Mou could become so popular today, as the user group grows, more and more feedback comes, he soon realized the bottleneck of one man sparetime development: There&amp;#39;re too much planned for 1.0 and there&amp;#39;re so little a single developer could do with his sparetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish the 1.0 goal, early this year, Chen even thought of selling Mou to a team with enough ability, but didn&amp;#39;t find a suitable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen Luo didn&amp;#39;t give up, instead of selling Mou to another team, today he is trying to build his own team (&lt;a href=&quot;http://25.io/&quot;&gt;25.io Inc&lt;/a&gt;), wanting to work full-time on Mou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is only $20,000 USD, which is very doable, and the campaign doesn&amp;#39;t end until November 28th, which is a ways away. And the reach goal would be super great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be glad to open source Mou if we can reach $100,000 USD (5 times of our $20,000 USD goal). Forget the crappy clones, let&amp;#39;s open source the original Mou!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you miss Mou updates as much as I do, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you&quot;&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; and give a few bucks. It would make a lot of Markdown people (like me) very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tech rock star launches new wonder wall</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-10-07-wonder-fm.png&quot; alt=&quot;wonder.fm&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian web developer and tech entrepreneur Stephen Phillips grew up with music in his life from an early age; he played guitar, sang, and even recorded an album, inspired by the successes of popular Aussie rock bands like INXS and Midnight Oil. But his star ascended when he co-founded a little company called We Are Hunted that was subsequently &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/11/twitters-music-app-is-real-beta-testing-as-we-are-hunted-shuts-down/&quot;&gt;acquired by Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His musical background and deep respect for the challenges indie musicians face when promoting new material held him in good stead when he, as CTO, formed Brisbane based Hunted Media in 2009. The firm developed a technology for scouring the internet for emerging music and new artists, and after gaining steam on the web and through various platform apps, was acquired by Twitter to kickstart their #music ambitions. Phillips spent a lot of time working under the Twitter banner in San Francisco, but the project was closed a year after it started, leaving him philosophical about his time in Silicon Valley. Notwithstanding the intense marketing hype and the huge amounts of capital splashed around the Valley, the next big thing will probably end up being a simple roll of the dice and a complete surprise to everyone, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, Phillips is enjoying being back home in Queensland, but hasn&amp;#39;t given up hacking on music tech. His new project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wonder.fm/&quot;&gt;wonder.fm&lt;/a&gt;, provides music recommendations based on the top rating tracks found on SoundCloud, a Germany based audio distribution platform with an enormous global following. To create an accessible and clean design, Phillips teamed up with his old mates at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.josephmark.com.au/&quot;&gt;Joseph Mark&lt;/a&gt;, a highly regarded digital product studio with an impressive music industry clientele. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are no plans at present to push Wonder.fm on any particular growth trajectory, Phillips is simply happy to keep playing around with the code and let other music lovers enjoy the results. He also has an iOS app in the pipeline which will no doubt please the hiperati. Wonder.fm has already been getting a lot of playtime around the iwantmyname office and of course we think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.FM domain name&lt;/a&gt; is pretty cool as well. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of October, including .deals and .nyc</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September was a giant month for new domain extensions, with 32 new top-level domains (TLDs) coming out, including the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.london&lt;/a&gt; (now the eighth most popular new gTLD) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;.nz&lt;/a&gt; (which reportedly passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dotnz/status/517102502731190272&quot;&gt;17k registrations&lt;/a&gt; in the first 24 hours). With the biggest month to date now behind us though, it&amp;#39;s time to look to the month ahead. For October, we only have six new domain extensions for you, but a few of them are certain to be very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember, pre-orders are still open for all future releases, so if you have a domain name in mind, be sure to get it on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;October 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-deals&quot;&gt;.deals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;October 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-city&quot;&gt;.city&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.nyc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;October 14&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-okinawa&quot;&gt;.okinawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;October 15&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-soy&quot;&gt;.soy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;October 22&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vet&quot;&gt;.vet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>How to drop the .co from your .co.nz domain today</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-30-more-nz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;.nz&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shorter .nz domains have arrived! Now you can purchase New Zealand’s country-code domain extension without the additional ‘.co’, ‘.net’ or ‘.org’. This naming convention is already common in most countries, and we’re pleased to now be able to offer this option to iwantmyname customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/101478574?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do I make the switch?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an existing .co.nz, .net.nz or .org.nz third-level domain name and are looking to grab your corresponding .nz domain name (it&amp;#39;s not mandatory, but people are likely going to gravitate to the shorter option), you&amp;#39;ll first need to check the status of your domain name at &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz&quot;&gt;anyname.nz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your domain has Preferential Registration Eligibility (PRE), you&amp;#39;ll have reservation rights on the corresponding .nz domain until March 31, 2015, and can register it with any registrar (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/reservation-process.html&quot;&gt;keep it from being reserved by anyone else for 2 years&lt;/a&gt;). Existing domains managed at iwantmyname or another registrar can be converted using our regular domain transfer option. Simply get the transfer authorisation code—also called UDAI—from the iwantmyname dashboard or your current registrar (if the domain is not managed with us) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;start your transfer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have PRE, your name may be conflicted, meaning at least two second levels are registered (e.g. you hold yourname.co.nz and others hold yourname.org.nz and yourname.school.nz). To resolve this, you can use anyname.nz’s online tool to &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/conflicted-names.html&quot;&gt;lodge your preference&lt;/a&gt; as to who should get the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third option is that if you registered your .co.nz domain name after 9am, 30 May 2012, your .nz domain name may be available on a first-come, first-served basis and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;purchase them as you normally would at iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How can I get my website to work with the shorter .nz domain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve registered ‘yourname.nz’, the easiest way to start is to simply forward it to your existing ‘yourname.co.nz’ domain name. You can do this using the “Web Forwarding” option in your iwantmyname dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-30-url-forwarding.png&quot; alt=&quot;.nz URL forwarding&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want to be done with your .co.nz domain altogether though, be sure to read Google&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/6029673?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=6001951&quot;&gt;instructions for transferring, moving, or migrating your site to a new domain&lt;/a&gt;. The act of changing your domain over is simple, but you can lose your search engine ranking if the transition isn&amp;#39;t planned carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you are starting a website or project from scratch, we&amp;#39;d definitely recommend using ‘yoursite.nz’ instead of ‘yoursite.co.nz’ from the beginning. It&amp;#39;ll save you the hassle of switching later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Send us any and all questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transition is a major one for New Zealand, and we want to make sure it&amp;#39;s a painless as possible. So if you have any questions about your .co.nz domain or the new .nz domain names in general, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Anil Dash speaks so much truth</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anil Dash wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/2014/09/15-lessons-from-15-years-of-blogging.html&quot;&gt;great article&lt;/a&gt; yesterday titled &amp;quot;15 Lessons from 15 Years of Blogging,&amp;quot; and if you&amp;#39;re a blogger (or just a blogger at heart), there&amp;#39;s so much good stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of my favorite lessons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typos in posts don&amp;#39;t reveal themselves until you&amp;#39;ve published.&lt;/strong&gt; If you schedule a post to publish in the future, the typos will be revealed then. This is an absolute, inviolable rule of blogging. This may be some sort of subtle lesson from the universe about our hubris in the face of fundamental impermanence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scroll is your friend.&lt;/strong&gt; If you write a bad post or something you don&amp;#39;t like, just post again. If you write something great that you&amp;#39;re really proud of and nobody notices, just post again. One foot in front of the other, one word after another, is the only path I&amp;#39;ve found to an overall body of work that I&amp;#39;m proud of. Push posts down the page, and the good and the bad will just scroll away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your blog can change your life in a month.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to understand an idea, or become a meaningful voice on a topic, or change your own thinking about a concept, write a little bit about it every day for a month. The first posts might suck, but invariably the exercise and the discipline of doing the writing are transformative. Sometimes the rest of the world even notices it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lesson that particularly struck me was one about blogging tools being &amp;quot;extraordinarily stagnant.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s an interesting argument, but one I think is starting to change. WYSIWYG editors are starting to be replaced by Markdown editors,  platforms like Ghost and Squarespace are adding features (or are planning to add them) at a rapid clip, and we&amp;#39;re now seeing all sorts of alternative backend storage systems for storing your posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s true. If 1999 me looked at a 2014 cell phone, computer, or piece of software, I&amp;#39;d be blown away. But a blog, for the most part, is still a blog. And I love blogs, but I&amp;#39;m really hoping the next 15 years sees more innovation than the last.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Get your site ready for the big .NZ launch</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-12-nz-launch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nz&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our US customers might have a hard time wrapping their heads around this, but local websites in much of the world end with something like this—.CO.NZ. But the days of &amp;quot;.CO&amp;quot; littering otherwise clean domains seems to be coming to an end. The United Kingdom recently opened up their &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.UK&lt;/a&gt; second-level domains, and New Zealand is now following suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting 30 September at 1pm NZDT, .NZ will be available to everyone on a first come, first served basis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;pre-registration&lt;/a&gt; is still open!). But current owners of .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ and .NET.NZ websites will have the ability to reserve their corresponding .NZ domain names for a limited time. Here are the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to get your corresponding .NZ domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/index.html&quot;&gt;check your &amp;quot;right of registration status&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which can be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferential Registration or Reservation (PRR) --  these are names that you are entitled to &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; before anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conflicted -- existing names that have more than one domain owner entitled to register them (like if different people owned website.CO.NZ and website.NET.NZ). These conflicted domains can be resolved at &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/&quot;&gt;anyname.nz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available to anyone -- domains that were registered after Feb 11, 2014 are available to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis. We recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;placing a pre-order for such .nz domains&lt;/a&gt; to be first in line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally, you can reserve your corresponding domain for up to two years without purchasing it through &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/&quot;&gt;anyname.nz&lt;/a&gt; (not affiliated with iwantmyname). You must do this before 30 March 2015 though, so if this is the path you want to take, don&amp;#39;t let it slip by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal for the world of New Zealand websites, so if you have any questions about the launch or your specific domain&amp;#39;s status, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>3 solutions for email independence and improved security</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-23-post-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Office&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email is one of those things most of us take for granted—this is your email address, and you can put it in any email app you want via IMAP or POP3. But each email address isn&amp;#39;t the same, and many platforms leave security/privacy minded individuals looking for better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re up against. Gmail, the most common email platform we come across, is a great example of what &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; email entails. From a decidedly non-tech article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/31/tech/web/gmail-privacy-problems/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google reported $16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone. One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The basic premise of Gmail is, we&amp;#39;ll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we&amp;#39;re scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant,&amp;quot; said Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far scarier than Google using your data for money though is the thought of being targeted by mass surveillance—especially if it&amp;#39;s your own government reading your messages as part of some national-security initiative. Some of the very things that scared the original readers of George Orwell&amp;#39;s 1984 so much are becoming true, and while most of us aren&amp;#39;t living in fear under a totalitarian state, where does the privacy line stop in our modern society? Could privately disagreeing with a public program over email put you on some kind of watch list? Could a harmless interaction with a coworker make you a surveillance target? Maybe not, but you&amp;#39;d be a fool to be too sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the best way to secure our collective email data is to decentralize it—to get it off the big grid. Here&amp;#39;s why, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/08/mailpile/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einarsson, an ex-Googler, points out that one of the biggest problems with e-mail is that large providers like Gmail make tempting targets for both malicious hackers and overzealous governments. A government service or a hacker with “direct access” to Google could tap thousands, perhaps millions, of e-mail boxes. But if no single e-mail provider had such a large user base, government and attackers would have a much harder time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s more expensive to subpoena hundreds or thousands of [e-mail providers] all over the world than it is to subpoena one big target like Gmail,” Einarsson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve established the problem, let&amp;#39;s find some solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mailpile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your problem is that all your data is stored in a massive cloud, the simple solution is to take it off. With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailpile.is/&quot;&gt;Mailpile&lt;/a&gt; email client, your email is downloaded locally—directly from the internet to your computer (or wherever). And when they say locally, they mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailpile.is/faq/&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then how do I access it when my computer is turned off?
You don&amp;#39;t! :-) for this reason, you may prefer to leave Mailpile running on a computer that is always on. You can then access it over the network using your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s email on your terms, and only you have access to it—which is how it should be. Mailpile is still in beta, but definitely keep track of its progress on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailpile.is/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mail-in-a-Box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d prefer to deploy your own email server (i.e. completely take control of your email), &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailinabox.email/&quot;&gt;Mail-in-a-Box&lt;/a&gt; is the solution for you. Just keep in mind that it&amp;#39;s not a great solution for the average user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the big holdup—from the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mailinabox.email/guide.html&quot;&gt;Pre-flight Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I run it at home?
No. Most residential Internet service providers block outbound mail to prevent abuse by spammers, and most residential networks are blocked on the receiving end because of that spam problem. Your home IP address is also probably dynamic, which is also a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re in the market to become your own ISP, you don&amp;#39;t mind being the admin of your own system, and you have a &amp;quot;completely fresh Ubuntu 14.04 machine&amp;quot; in a non-residential location, Mail-in-a-Box is definitely something worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to get around potential government spying is to house your email servers in a country with strict privacy laws. So, in addition to end-to-end encryption, zero tracking, and self-destructing messages (think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA2KmJMKFrQ&quot;&gt;Mission Impossible&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.ch/&quot;&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;is incorporated in Switzerland and our servers are located in Switzerland. We are outside of US and EU jurisdiction and user data is protected by strict Swiss data protection laws.&amp;quot; Also, the company was founded by &amp;quot;scientists who met at CERN&amp;quot;—and that has to count for something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the ProtonMail Beta is currently on hold due to demand, but more &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.ch/invite&quot;&gt;invites&lt;/a&gt; will be going out once additional servers are put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.NZ ope.nz up 5 amazing domain hack possibilities</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-19-dot-nz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dot NZ&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As New Zealanders patiently await the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;.NZ&lt;/a&gt; launch on September 30, we&amp;#39;d like to give the rest of the world a chance to get excited about our newly shortened domain extension. So I present to you... my top 5 domain hack possibilities using .NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But quickly, before I get too excited about pouring through the Scrabble Word Finder for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scrabblefinder.com/ends-with/ns/&quot;&gt;words ending in &amp;quot;ns&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, here&amp;#39;s a quick refresher on what a domain hack is. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ll quote myself&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain hack&lt;/strong&gt; - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or phrases out of domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.es:&lt;/strong&gt; mak.es, bak.es, flak.es, cak.es, tak.es, cod.es, dat.es, pag.es, pi.es, stor.es, smor.es (yum), veggi.es, whistl.es, [YOURNAME]lik.es&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.io:&lt;/strong&gt; rad.io, pat.io, tr.io, rat.io, aud.io, cheer.io, portfol.io, scenar.io, card.io&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, here are my top 5 domain hack possibilities using .NZ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sig.nz&lt;/strong&gt;- Think of all the glorious signs you should show off that deserve to live on a site ending with a &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;. This is a Tumblog waiting to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current NZ Prime Minister John Key&amp;#39;s name doesn&amp;#39;t fit the bill, but former Prime Minister William Hall-Jones (1906) certainly would&amp;#39;ve impressed the local youth with a &lt;strong&gt;williamhall-jo.nz&lt;/strong&gt; domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Krake.nz&lt;/strong&gt; - Because one Kraken simply isn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allia.nz&lt;/strong&gt; - As of 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Allianz&quot;&gt;Allianz was&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;the world&amp;#39;s largest insurance company, the 11th-largest financial services group and 25th-largest company according to a composite measure by Forbes magazine.&amp;quot; They&amp;#39;d be crazy not to domain hack their brand name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pytho.nz&lt;/strong&gt; - Not to leave the devs out, I&amp;#39;m proposing this as the grand site for Python implementations. These are free ideas, people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a better idea? Make sure to pre-order it by September 30th before geniuses like myself turn it into internet gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I was scolded for not adding kitte.nz (or the alternate, kitteh.nz). No explanation needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-19-kittenz.gif&quot; alt=&quot;kittens&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rapid de-oxygenation&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Globe Runner sheds some light on the .COM vs. new gTLD debate</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-18-big-menu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Menu&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time not so long ago when the domain selecting process was as easy as finding a short, available name that sounded good. But then came the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). Do you go with the shortest, most brand-centric domain name in the .COM space now or do you get the exact name you want in a new gTLD like .CLUB, .LINK, or .TODAY? It&amp;#39;s a big question that everyone in the space is asking, and now there&amp;#39;s some data to help make your decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Globe Runner&amp;#39;s article &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://globerunner.com/com-vs-new-gtld/&quot;&gt;Search Engine Marketing Study: .Com Vs. New gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our overall goal when setting up these tests was ultimately to determine whether using a .Com domain name or a new gTLD domain name is better when it comes to search engine marketing and Google AdWords. We are not totally convinced that one is necessarily “better” than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we did see, though, is that Google AdWords tends to favor the new gTLDs, as they served up more impressions, for less cost, and a better average position then the .Com domain names we used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if you&amp;#39;re a google AdWords user, it&amp;#39;ll generally cost you less to get more impressions with gTLDs than with .COM. But the other aspect of the study is conversions. The study ran two tests, one with a .DIAMONDS site vs. a .COM and one with a .MENU site vs. a .COM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.DIAMONDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were more conversions on the .com domain name for both the download of the PDF file and for clicks on the “Shop Diamond Rings” button on the site, and the total conversion rate was higher on the .Com domain name than it is on the .Diamonds domain name. So while the Google AdWords tends to favor the new gTLD domain name, consumers appear to favor the .Com (we saw nearly a 20 percent better conversion rate on the .Com domain name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.MENU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTR was actually better and cheaper using the .Menu domain name. Also, the average position of our ads using the .Menu domain name was better (it was higher) than the .Com. So it was clear to us that Google AdWords actually prefers the .Menu domain name over the .Com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this brings up a big point for me—not all gTLDs are equal. And it has nothing to do with the gTLD itself, but of the clientele you&amp;#39;re trying to reach. People tend to be much more conservative when large amounts of money are on the table, and trying to lure someone in to buy diamonds online with a .DIAMONDS domain name seems screams of a potential scam. But .MENU, especially when attached to a restaurant people already know, presents no threat at all. If I were a local business depending on matching branding for discoverability, I&amp;#39;d absolutely go with a new gTLD if the .COM was already taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://globerunner.com/com-vs-new-gtld/&quot;&gt;whole report&lt;/a&gt; though to see the entirety of the test. If your marketing relies on Google AdWords or PPC marketing, the results may be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ello, a new ad-free social network to say hello</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-16-ello.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ello&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Gabriel Weinberg&amp;#39;s Blog, in an article titled, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2014/09/what-i-use-instead-of-google-services.html&quot;&gt;What I use instead of Google services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I don&amp;#39;t like to be tracked more than I need to be. I believe in privacy policies that do the minimum collection needed as opposed to the maximum collection possible. I am also the founder of the search engine that doesn&amp;#39;t track you, DuckDuckGo. For these reasons, I personally don&amp;#39;t use Google services where I don&amp;#39;t absolutely have to, and honestly it&amp;#39;s not very hard to do because there are good alternatives. I get asked a lot what I use instead of Google services, and this post answers that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I need to introduce the importance of reducing unnecessary data collection in today&amp;#39;s internet, but knowing which platforms to use can be tricky. The linked article above does a wonderful job listing out some great services for storage, cloud docs, email platforms, etc., so be sure to give it a read. But I just have one little addendum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Social media: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ello.co/&quot;&gt;Ello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, another social media platform. But after personally using Ello for a month or so, I&amp;#39;m really excited about the community they&amp;#39;re building. I&amp;#39;m also a big fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ello.co/manifesto&quot;&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your social network is owned by advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every post you share, every friend you make and every link you follow is tracked, recorded and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce and manipulate — but a place to connect, create and celebrate life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ello is still in beta, but if you&amp;#39;re already signed up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ello.co/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;please say hi&lt;/a&gt;! And if you need an invite, just drop us a line in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ask iwantmyname: Blogging suggestions for occasional writers</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have published articles occasionally online. So far, I&amp;#39;ve tended to write about football - here&amp;#39;s my most recent effort: &lt;a href=&quot;http://brightonion.svbtle.com/&quot;&gt;brightonion.svbtle.com&lt;/a&gt;. They don&amp;#39;t get read by many people but they seem to be appreciated by those who read them. I chose Svbtle to write because I liked the minimalist design and, as it was an ad hoc project, I didn&amp;#39;t want to pay. Now Svbtle have started to charge for new users and existing users have to cough up for extra services. As an occasional writer I&amp;#39;m reluctant to commit to paying $6 every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I enjoyed writing those articles I&amp;#39;m planning to write more regularly and possibly about other topics. But, initially at least, not I don&amp;#39;t envisage writing regularly enough to pay a monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that one of the blogging services that you recommend may suit me: &lt;a href=&quot;https://roon.io/&quot;&gt;Roon.io&lt;/a&gt;. It has a similar minimal look which I like, most of the services are free, and I can add a domain, which is something that appeals if all goes well. However, you also recommend other similar minimalist sites, and there are many more out there. Also, most of the research I&amp;#39;ve done online recommends using Wordpress as it is more versatile in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you think that Roon.io is suitable for my current needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you recommend a Wordpress site? Or would this be more suitable for a more regular blogger or if my output becomes more regular?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given my requirements, what would be the advantages of adding a domain to where I post my articles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter McFarlane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great questions! Let&amp;#39;s run through the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Do you think that Roon.io is suitable for my current needs?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know exactly what you mean about not necessarily wanting to pay for a site you&amp;#39;re not updating regularly—my abandoned-site graveyard is probably larger than most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your circumstances, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roon.io/&quot;&gt;Roon.io&lt;/a&gt; would be a wonderful choice. There are a few things I like about it specifically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s Markdown native, but also allows for Rich Text if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re comfortable with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s super clean, which I&amp;#39;m always a fan of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can start your site/blog for free, and the content exporter is quite nice, so if you don&amp;#39;t like the platform you can leave at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this goes right into your third question. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Given my requirements, what would be the advantages of adding a domain to where I post my articles?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Roon.io for free comes with a branded domain (something like brightonion.roon.com), but for $12/yr you can enable custom domains. Is that something you&amp;#39;d need? I&amp;#39;d say yes, and here&amp;#39;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a reader&amp;#39;s perspective, there a strong sense of quality and permanence that comes with having a custom domain. For example, brightonion.com feels like a much stronger brand than brightonion.svbtle.com because it&amp;#39;s the master of its domain, and isn&amp;#39;t tied to the successes or whims of a platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you grow your site, you may want to start using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&quot;&gt;custom email address&lt;/a&gt; like peter@brightonion.com, which would require you to own the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With your own domain, you can pack up and move platforms without confusing your existing readers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owning a domain really doesn&amp;#39;t cost a whole lot. You&amp;#39;re looking at claiming a brand for yourself and solely possessing it for pennies a day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, we&amp;#39;ll go with the final question. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Would you recommend a Wordpress site? Or would this be more suitable for a more regular blogger or if my output becomes more regular?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is certainly the largest of the site platforms you could choose from, but it&amp;#39;s really two platforms—both have major plusses and minuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress.com is the hosted version of Wordpress, meaning you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about hosting space at all. And it&amp;#39;s very user-friendly, with a clean CMS and simple design options that let you accomplish just about anything. But, and this is a big but, once you&amp;#39;re looking to do anything outside of the base offering (which is free), you&amp;#39;re looking at substantial &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.wordpress.com/plans/&quot;&gt;premium charges&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real flexibility comes when you have a Wordpress.org site, but that requires some work on your end. First, you&amp;#39;ll have to have your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;hosting space&lt;/a&gt;, which isn&amp;#39;t difficult or overly expensive, but does require some additional work. Then, if you want to change things, it&amp;#39;s all up to you. You&amp;#39;ll have full control of your HTML and CSS (plus an unlimited supply of templates and add-ons you can download), but you&amp;#39;re not going to get a drag and drop interface to tweak the little things. I don&amp;#39;t want to dissuade you here though—my first few website endeavors were through Wordpress.org, and after a little learning and tinkering, I was plenty happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re unsure about Wordpress but want something more substantial than Roon.io, I&amp;#39;d also take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. The costs might be prohibitive if you&amp;#39;re just looking at close-to-free casual writing, but both offer some nice features. Squarespace is probably the easiest to use of all the robust platforms on the market, and Ghost has some awesome features available if you have some dev skills in your toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to Peter for letting us use this as a blog post. And if you have a question you&amp;#39;d like answered (no blog post promises), just &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;send it over&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Next week, today: So many new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been launching a handful of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) each week for quite a while now, but never have we seen a launch so loaded as next weeks. 15 (?!) new gTLDs are launching between September 15-17, and this calls for some kind of pre-week announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;September 15&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cooking&quot;&gt;.cooking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-country&quot;&gt;.country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-fishing&quot;&gt;.fishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-horse&quot;&gt;.horse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-republican&quot;&gt;.republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rodeo&quot;&gt;.rodeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas&quot;&gt;.vegas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vodka&quot;&gt;.vodka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;September 17&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-church&quot;&gt;.church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guide&quot;&gt;.guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-host&quot;&gt;.host&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-life&quot;&gt;.life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-loans&quot;&gt;.loans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&quot;&gt;.press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-website&quot;&gt;.website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already received a good amount of pre-orders for next week&amp;#39;s batch (with an interesting duo, .church and .vegas, taking the lead), but if you have a domain in mind, be sure to pre-order it though the individual TLD pages listed above. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How we upgraded our domain search using Erlang, RabbitMQ and Socket.IO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we quietly released an almost completely reworked domain name search engine. Our older system, of which there had already been several iterations, was no longer coping with our incremental growth and the dozens of new top level domains being released each month (with 500+ more still due to launch). Not only are more people searching for domains, but the number of domains searched was stretching our old domain search engine&amp;#39;s limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an overview of the issues in our old system and how the new one solves these issues and sets us up for future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The old way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stack for search included an Erlang application (hereafter called &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt;) that listened for WebSocket connections using SockJS. It also listened to RabbitMQ messages from our web servers to indicate a new search had been triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-04-old-search-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old search diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a customer loaded the search page, their browser connected to SockJS with their session ID. When they entered a domain name, the search was sent to the web application, and then after some validation, the search was forwarded via RabbitMQ to &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt; with the session and search ID. This made &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt; do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a list of TLDs to the user with price information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make requests to the registries or registrars that we connect to, asking if the name is available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache responses to avoid duplicate checks for the same name and to avoid getting the TLD list from our database on every search request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward responses to the user using the session and search ID to match it to the SockJS connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this served us okay for a while, there were a few problems causing frustration for our customers and for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every time a domain name was searched, we sent back the list of TLDs which was mostly static.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A search would send requests to check &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; available TLDs at the time the search was sent. While we maintain a persistent connection to our upstream services and buffer these checks, sending this mass of checks at once tied up the queue until they were all processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started hitting API limits for checks, although these issues were temporarily resolved by talking nicely to the right people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the above could probably have been worked around, but the most troubling was that SockJS connections would be unexpectedly terminated. This meant people would never get the list of TLDs, wait forever for results, or only get a partial list of availability. We tried the usual—checking connection limits, open file descriptors and timeouts etc.—but found nothing obvious. And unfortunately, none of us are extremely experienced Erlang developers, so despite reading the source code of our dependencies, we couldn&amp;#39;t find the cause. It was also impossible for us to replicate outside of production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The new way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that our biggest concern was the SockJS connections being prematurely terminated, we looked for a new library to use for WebSockets. In the end we chose Socket.IO (on Node.js) after their version 1.0 release. This allowed us to change the focus of the Erlang backend to checking domain availability, and the Node.js daemon to maintain WebSocket connections and forwarding search requests (again, via RabbitMQ) to &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt;, only this time, &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt; would reply via RabbitMQ and let Socket.IO deal with handing the response back to the customer&amp;#39;s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-04-new-search-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;New search diagram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other difference is that now the web application sends the TLD list to the client, which allows us to not have to send a list of all every TLD for each search request. The initial reason the TLD list was being sent for every search was that it could be different depending on what name you searched for. This filtering is now handled by client-side Javascript (and you’ll get an error if you cheekily use the Socket.IO connection to search for, say, a two-character domain on a TLD that doesn’t support two letter name registrations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frontend now only searches names as they appear on the screen. So instead of searching for all the TLDs at once, and potentially clogging up the pipes for other people searching at the same time as you, it’ll only show the availability of the domains you’re looking currently looking at. While this adds a slight delay to seeing the availability of a specific domain, it means searches like &lt;code&gt;myawesomename.com&lt;/code&gt; come back much faster because we&amp;#39;re not bothering to instantly search every TLD available (and because the customer has specified &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, it’ll show that TLD at the top).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new design also sets us up to substitute alternative approaches to domain name availability checks. Long lists of domains might be good for some people, while a category-grouping approach might work better for others. And customized search results based on where you&amp;#39;re browsing from (e.g. New Zealand visitors might see &lt;code&gt;.co.nz&lt;/code&gt; at the top.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Give it a go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in place, your domain searches are snappier and more stable. We&amp;#39;re now gearing up for alternative designs of our domain search results page. And we&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts! Try the search box below and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The one-stop-shop for royalty free stock photos</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-06-thank-you-sign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thank You sign&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you maintain a blog or are working on a web project that requires good photography, you&amp;#39;re probably well-traveled in the frightening world of stock photography. Giant sites, endless keyword results, and thousands upon thousands of pictures like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-06-terrible-stock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terrible&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s been a bit of a movement lately to make stock photography better. Sites are popping up like &lt;a href=&quot;http://unsplash.com/&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nos.twnsnd.co/&quot;&gt;New Old Stock&lt;/a&gt; that compile wonderful royalty free or Public Archive images together to give web creators a much nicer, much cheaper option for making things look nice. We posted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/need-images-for-your-site-here-are-some-tips-for-doing-it-right-tip-1-never-use-the-corporate-high-five.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; back in February that mentioned Dustin Senos&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b&quot;&gt;curated list&lt;/a&gt; of stock photo sites, but now a group called &lt;a href=&quot;http://usepanda.com/&quot;&gt;Panda&lt;/a&gt; is taking this curation one step further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-06-the-stocks.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Stocks&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thestocks.im/&quot;&gt;The Stocks&lt;/a&gt;, and acts as a little web portal for accessing all the best stock image sites available. Unsplash, Little Visuals, Super Famous, Gratisography, Pexels—they&amp;#39;re all there, just waiting to take your stock image game to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be sure to follow the conditions for each site when you use the images. Everything on The Stocks is royalty free, and most are listed under Creative Commons Zero (&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt;), which means that &amp;quot;you can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission&amp;quot;, but Super Famous and possibly more are under CC3, which requires attribution. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the new domain extensions of September, including .london, .nz and .beer</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) is looking up in September, with a great collection of locations, professions and industries being represented. For starters, we have .london, ,yokohama, .vegas and .bayern launching, as well as .nz, New Zealand&amp;#39;s newly opened second-level domain (not a gTLD, but still a very exciting September launch). Some other big expected TLDs are .digital, .guide, .life and .direct—all are fairly short, and have a wide range of uses for various industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the tastiest gTLD of the month is .beer. We have an amazing craft-beer scene here in Wellington, and we&amp;#39;d love to see the industry adopt a domain extension with a little character. Our expectations are dampened a bit by the soft launch of .coffee (only 6,858 domains registered worldwide according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/&quot;&gt;Domain Incite Pro&lt;/a&gt;), but maybe a more global beer scene will push its growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty more domains coming out though, so don&amp;#39;t miss the rest of the list. And remember—pre-registration is still available, so if you have a specific domain in mind, this is your best chance to grab it before it opens to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>September domain discounts, featuring .CLUB and .TV</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-09-03-tiny-tv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TV&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider discount-oriented online businesses to be an unhealthy model, but each month we do like to put a few domain extensions on sale as a market predictor of sorts. This month, we&amp;#39;re really excited about a few country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) that double as generic phrases and a couple of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) that we just like right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.TV &lt;/a&gt;-  $34.90/yr (from $39)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; -  $15.50/yr (from $29.90)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; - $19.90/yr (from $24.90)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; - $49.00/yr (from $59.00)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.CO, .ME and .IO (especially for tech sites) have been consistent for some time, but .TV has been especially newsworthy of late because of the twitch.tv acquisition by Amazon. I&amp;#39;ve always been interested in the idea of TLDs categorizing the web, and .TV makes perfect sense for online video portals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; - $9.90/yr (from $19.90)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-buzz&quot;&gt;.BUZZ&lt;/a&gt; - $34.90/yr (from $49.00)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the launch of the gTLDs, .CLUB was simply trying harder at marketing than the majority of the field. At the end of the day, the public will be the decider of gTLD popularity, but if any extension will reach mass expectancy by sheer will, it&amp;#39;s going to be .CLUB. On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/&quot;&gt;Domain Incite Pro&lt;/a&gt; registrations list, .CLUB is currently in third place, with just over 100,000 domains registered—a huge milestone for the overall namespace expansion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to wait for these posts to find our domain sales—catch them as they happen on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&quot;&gt;monthly discounts page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New domain extension trends: cities, non-Latin are in, retail is not</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in domain names or like to follow the domain name industry, it&amp;#39;s good to take a step back every once in a while to look at the new gTLD (generic top-level domain) trends that are emerging. iwantmyname&amp;#39;s business model really doesn&amp;#39;t benefit from the popularity of one domain extension over another, but for us, this is perhaps the most exciting namespace expansion we&amp;#39;ll ever see. I mean, there&amp;#39;s a real chance that decades from now we&amp;#39;ll all look back at the early days of the internet and laugh about how everything used to end in .com. We&amp;#39;re still at the beginning of this whole &amp;quot;internet naming&amp;quot; thing, but the scaffolding for the future is being constructed before our very eyes. Here are some of the trends we&amp;#39;re noticing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City TLDs are definitely going to be popular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/08/hyperlocalize-with-a-city-tld.html&quot;&gt;talked about this&lt;/a&gt; a bunch in the past, but of the five city TLDs launched so far (.berlin, .hamburg, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nagoya&quot;&gt;.nagoya&lt;/a&gt;, .tokyo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wien&quot;&gt;.wien&lt;/a&gt;), three are in the top 25 of domains registered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; at #2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&quot;&gt;.tokyo&lt;/a&gt; at #17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-hamburg&quot;&gt;.hamburg&lt;/a&gt; at #24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.london&lt;/a&gt;, is already at #18, even though it won&amp;#39;t be available for general registration until September 9th. If current success is any indication, we&amp;#39;ll be seeing a lot of local websites with city TLDs in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Non-Latin TLDs are picking up steam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more exciting trends of this new naming expansion is the launch of TLDs that don&amp;#39;t use Latin characters. In the future we&amp;#39;ll have domains in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, and the internet will be better for it. The currently launched non-Latin gTLDs vary in popularity, but four are currently in the top 25:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.公司&lt;/a&gt; at #8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt; at #10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.网络&lt;/a&gt; at #12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; at #22. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;General business TLDs are making a push&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business TLDs as a whole are a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but some of the more internet-native/savvy general business TLDs seem to be doing quite well. In the top 25, we have: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&quot;&gt;.link&lt;/a&gt; at #4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt; at #7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email&quot;&gt;.email&lt;/a&gt; at #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company&quot;&gt;.company&lt;/a&gt; at #14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-solutions&quot;&gt;.solutions&lt;/a&gt; at #15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center&quot;&gt;.center&lt;/a&gt; at #16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&quot;&gt;.technology&lt;/a&gt; at #20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&quot;&gt;.directory&lt;/a&gt; at #21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Retail and physical business TLDs are not&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While TLDs for companies that primarily live on the web are doing fairly well, traditionally brick-and-mortar businesses don&amp;#39;t seem as ready to migrate from .com. Extensions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.clothing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.bike&lt;/a&gt; are the top pair, but neither have more that 13,000 registrations. And promising TLDs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-equipment&quot;&gt;.equipment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&quot;&gt;.coffee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo&quot;&gt;.tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-boutique&quot;&gt;.boutique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing&quot;&gt;.plumbing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shoes&quot;&gt;.shoes&lt;/a&gt; have yet to crack the 10,000 registration mark. That&amp;#39;s not to say that they won&amp;#39;t eventually be successful, but it seems like small businesses with physical locations are hesitant to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;Discount TLDs&amp;quot; aren&amp;#39;t doing well at all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising trends is that the TLDs related to the deals industry aren&amp;#39;t doing well at all. The top of the pack, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cheap&quot;&gt;.cheap&lt;/a&gt;, only has 3,281 domains registered, sitting just out of the top 100 at #105. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blackfriday&quot;&gt;.blackfriday&lt;/a&gt;, the deals TLD for the day after Thanksgiving in the US? Only 657 total registrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a guess, but deal sites tend to struggle with legitimacy, and being an outlier in an industry with a lot of perceived fraud probably isn&amp;#39;t a compelling business plan. Once the world deems these new gTLDs normal, I&amp;#39;m guessing the &amp;quot;discount TLDs&amp;quot; will start changing over to get out of the crowded .com namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>A free tool for finding the top sites in each domain extension</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-28-domain-punch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Domain Punch&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are countless sites on the web dishing out advice for how you should name your website/company, but sometimes the very best recommendation is to look at what&amp;#39;s currently popular. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/08/26/quickly-find-the-top-websites-built-on-new-tlds/&quot;&gt;Domain Name Wire&lt;/a&gt; recently found a great site for this—&lt;a href=&quot;https://domainpunch.com/topm/&quot;&gt;Domain Punch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Domain Punch does is list the Alexa top million websites, then lets you sort by top-level domain (TLD). So if you want to see the most popular sites on the web using .guru or .kiwi, you can (as long as the TLD has a site in the top million). It&amp;#39;s really handy, and best of all, it&amp;#39;s totally free to use (&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/pro/&quot;&gt;Domain Incite Pro&lt;/a&gt; has a similar tool, but you have to be a paying customer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain Name Wire does bring up a good point though. &amp;quot;Now, a big caveat: these tools are based on Alexa data. Alexa is notoriously inaccurate. It’s just directionally correct. Domains separated by ranks of 10,000 and even 100,000 might actually be reversed for true traffic volume.&amp;quot; So take the rankings you see with a grain of salt—I&amp;#39;d recommend using this more for idea generation than stat collection. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Droplr is an exceptionally useful tool for sharing files and screenshots</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quietly resting on my desktop nav, next to the icons for Twitter, Dropbox, OnePassword, Wifi and Finder, is the stylized Droplr drop—arguably one of the most useful apps on my computer. It doesn&amp;#39;t do a whole lot, but what it does, it does quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-26-droplr-screenshot-one-compressor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes, and lets you share, screenshots&lt;/strong&gt;: This may be a non-issue on the PC, but in OSX, the default screenshot app, Grab, really isn&amp;#39;t all that useful. For one, the default filetype used by Grab is TIFF, which almost always needs to be exported to .jpg or .png for any kind of practical use. And once the shot is taken, there aren&amp;#39;t any quick features for highlighting segments or leaving notes—you have to open files in other apps to do anything with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely replacing Grab on my computer is Droplr, which allows me to take regular screenshots, URL-as-photo screenshots (full-page shots) and &amp;quot;Capture and draw&amp;quot; screenshots, giving me some basic tools for circling key points and adding text.  Then, once your screenshot is taken, it&amp;#39;s automatically attached to a link in your clipboard, meaning you&amp;#39;re only a cmd-V away from sending your file to a friend or co-worker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And screencasts!&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;#39;s one thing to tell someone how to do something, but showing them is almost always a better solution. So if you want to to show someone how to do a Photoshop effect or just where a basic option is hidden, Droplr screen recordings are definitely the answer. Just drag open a window to record in, do what you need to do, stop the recording, then send the auto-generated link (&lt;a href=&quot;http://iwmn.me/gG8O/5Y16w4yd&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes file sharing simple&lt;/strong&gt;: For all the efficiency advancements computers have made in the last decade, sending basic files still seems a bit slow. But with Droplr, just select a file (up to 2GB) and hit option-D to copy it to your clipboard to send out (it&amp;#39;s great for sending private &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwmn.me/le6c/4NaMlFYk&quot;&gt;dog photos&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All your files are attached to a custom domain&lt;/strong&gt;: To me, this is an invaluable feature. When you&amp;#39;re sending files around, especially to clients, it&amp;#39;s important to establish a level of trust. So first, Droplr allows you to password protect your links and create self-destructing drops. But then it takes the next step and allows you to send links with your very own custom short domain. So instead of sending emails or messages with links to shady files, we can send out links like iwmn.me./XXXXXXX. And the setup is incredibly simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding a custom domain to Droplr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;the best apps and platforms&lt;/a&gt;, adding a custom domain is painless with iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-26-droplr-iwmn-add.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Droplr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you already have a short domain registered (if not, start &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/customize-droplr-with-your-own-domain&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), login to your iwantmyname account and select &lt;strong&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Services&lt;/strong&gt; under the &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; menu in the top nav. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From here, either type &lt;strong&gt;Droplr&lt;/strong&gt; into the search field, or select the app under the &lt;strong&gt;URL Shortener&lt;/strong&gt; menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select with domain you want to add Droplr too, then click &lt;strong&gt;Install Droplr&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, sign into your Droplr account (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://droplr.com/hello&quot;&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt; to sign up) and click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; in the bottom nav.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;strong&gt;Custom Domain&lt;/strong&gt; (you&amp;#39;ll need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://droplr.com/hello&quot;&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; account) and type in your short domain, then hit Save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you send your short domain, it&amp;#39;ll now look like short.tld/XXXX. If someone tried to go to short.tld though, they&amp;#39;d be redirected to droplr.com. To prevent this, under custom domain in the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; screen, add your primary domain into the &lt;strong&gt;Root Redirect&lt;/strong&gt; field. For us, that automatically redirects iwmn.me to iwantmyname.com, and for you it&amp;#39;ll do the same, but with your domain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it. Now when you shorten links, send files or big screencasts, the link provided will be properly branded. If you&amp;#39;re having any issues with the setup process though, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always here to help. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Hyperlocalize your domain name with a city TLD</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Amongst the craziness that are the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), cities seem to be a bastion of pragmatism. They just make sense—if your company or brand is localized to a city, a city TLD gives your site an easily remembered identifier in a namespace that will have much less competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in July, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/cities-are-a-good-bet-for-new-domain-extension-success.html&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Around the world (aside from the US), county-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are hugely popular, with .co.uk domain extension registrations in particular numbering well into the millions. And that sort of localized naming scheme seems to translate well to cities, with .Berlin currently sitting as the second most popular gTLD currently available.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;nTLDStats&lt;/a&gt;, .Berlin&amp;#39;s popularity is holding up (still in the #2 spot), and the recently launched .Tokyo and .Wien (Vienna) are also quite popular at #16 and #45 respectively. City TLD popularity seems to be inevitable at this point (at least for big cities), and we&amp;#39;ll get an idea of just how popular they&amp;#39;ll be starting August 27th with .Hamburg, and continuing into the end of the year with .Capetown, .Durban and .Joburg, with more likely to come throughout 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City gTLD launch calendar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aug. 27 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-hamburg&quot;&gt;.Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sep. 9 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sep. 9 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-yokohama&quot;&gt;.Yokohama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sep. 15 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas&quot;&gt;.Vegas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname culture: On hiring and hierarchy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-19-iwmn-team.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Team&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one truth about growing a company is that at some point you&amp;#39;ll run out of qualified friends to employ. For us, our first hire outside of that group was a developer, because we badly needed someone who was good at the things we sucked at. And our hire was a good one, as he is an absolute expert in his field—but his most important trait was that he fit in really well with the team. Ever since our first hiring experience, we&amp;#39;ve made fitting in a top priority when adding team members, and it&amp;#39;s worked out extremely well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When we first created iwantmyname we had all worked at companies of various sizes, and knew from the start that small, well-functioning teams almost always consisted of diverse people with different backgrounds, different (and abundant) experiences, and a high level of cohesiveness. And that high level of cohesiveness is important so that everyone can trust each other to do their jobs—which allows us to almost completely do away with the traditional management hierarchy. With everyone working on a defined aspect of the company, we can make sure everyone gets to try things out, make decisions, measure if they work, and report back to the team their successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies speak about flat hierarchy and how they don&amp;#39;t have many
control structures in place, but for us it was really something that just developed out of hiring the right people. If you work with peers you trust, a management layer becomes obsolete, which frees up additional time to get actual work done and move the company forward. The speed of the company should be at the speed of the workers, not of the management layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, hiring for us is an important factor and we don&amp;#39;t take it lightly. Hiring is also a limiting factor in our business, but by hiring the right people, taking longer to choose them, and not expanding our team too fast, we hope to maintain our culture of self direction, self empowerment and self development. With the backdrop of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&quot;&gt;equal salaries&lt;/a&gt;, I hope this paints a rough picture of what it&amp;#39;s like to work at iwantmyname. Flat hierarchy for us is a culture—an organic result of hiring the right people to do the right jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More on the subject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chuck Blakeman of Inc.com recently put out a great post titled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/chuck-blakeman/4-steps-to-hiring-people-you-ll-never-have-to-manage.html?cid=sf01001&quot;&gt;How to Hire People You&amp;#39;ll Never Have to Manage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Included is a quote every company should remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to hire people you won&amp;#39;t have to manage, throw out most of what you&amp;#39;ve been taught about hiring. Hire first for Business Beliefs and Culture, second for talent, third for demonstrated skills, and use experience as a tiebreaker. You, and the people who you hire, will all be happier and more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Codetoki, another JFDI Asia success story</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-19-singapore-skyscrapers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Singapore&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month my son and I jumped into a big silver bird and headed north to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/leaping-into-singapores-startup-scene.html&quot;&gt;start-up scene in tropical Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. During our visit to the business friendly island state we not only enjoyed the famous nighttime cuisine, but also made many new friends in the start-up community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jfdiasia/status/490113108845682690&quot;&gt;made welcome&lt;/a&gt; at co-working space JFDI Asia, also widely regarded as Asia&amp;#39;s leading tech accelerator. The JFDI crew had only just recovered from their &lt;a href=&quot;http://e27.co/jfdi-2014a-cohort-graduates-bang-20140709/0&quot;&gt;big demo day&lt;/a&gt; the previous week, so the place was still abuzz with &amp;quot;joyful&amp;quot; entrepreneurs, mentors and interns, especially so as there was also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jfdiasia/status/489331687126360064&quot;&gt;visit by Dave McClure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://geeksonaplane.com/goap_destinations/southeast-asia/&quot;&gt;Geeks On A Plane&lt;/a&gt; that same week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of JFDI alumni are iwantmyname customers already, so it was a great thrill to sit down with some of the freshly minted start-up founders and chat about future directions. Bearing in mind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/philippines-disaster-six-months-downstream.html&quot;&gt;recent hardships&lt;/a&gt; faced by the Philippines, it was especially wonderful to meet Codetoki co-founder Honeylyn Balingcasag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codetoki.com&quot;&gt;Codetoki&lt;/a&gt;, which originally emerged as a concept from the 2012 Cebu Startup Weekend, is a gamified application that match-makes job applicants with employers in the software industry, based on credits earned through various coding challenges. Codetoki has already established some key relationships in the IT industry, and boasts a growing user base made up of the youthful and well-educated workforces throughout the Asia-Pacific countries and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codetoki is one of several startups I met with at JDFI, many of whom are addressing real world needs in fun and practical ways with the guidance of excellent advisors. It was refreshing to see such a vibrant scene firsthand, and if you&amp;#39;re ever in Singapore, this is one stop you shouldn&amp;#39;t miss.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Naming a website is hard—here are 6 tips to make it easier</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a random business owner or entrepreneur what the hardest part of their startup process was and you&amp;#39;ll likely hear &amp;quot;naming&amp;quot;. Naming your business, brand or simple blog can be extremely challenging because there&amp;#39;s no exact science or guaranteed process to lean on. It needs to be unique but uncomplicated, easy to say but different enough to separate you from the pack, and ultimately, it needs to embody your story. Or maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though—when you&amp;#39;re starting your naming process, you should always keep your domain name possibilities in mind. In this modern internet era, your website might just be your brand&amp;#39;s most public portal, so you need to make it count. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quick tips to make your naming process a bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;#39;t stray from your brand, especially for keyword stuffing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consumer, it&amp;#39;s hard to remember a site when the brand name doesn&amp;#39;t match the domain name. And you might think this is a common sense tip, but I see it all the time—especially with older sites trying to take advantage of keyword stuffing, an old SEO trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2014/01/15/domain-name-importance-in-ranking/&quot;&gt;From Duane Forrester - Bing:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking today is a result of so many signals fed into the system the words used in a domain send less and less information into the stack as a percentage of overall decision making signals. This is great from our view (the engine) as it results in better results showing at the top since no one signal can be manipulated. From the searchers POV, it’s better simply because those sites trying to abuse their way to the top with a keyword rich domain and irrelevant or poor content cease to rank well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for practical purposes, if you&amp;#39;re a real estate agent, your top priority should be ease of discovery. If your brand is &amp;quot;The Hall Team&amp;quot;, thehallteam.com would be a much better choice than best-real-estate-wellington.com. And it&amp;#39;s not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;#39;s much easier now to make your name work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hangups in the past for naming is that brands felt like they were stuck with .COM as their only viable domain extension. And because .COM was (and still is) so crowded, you&amp;#39;ll often see companies use naming conventions like BRANDNAMEbrand.com, getBRANDNAME.com, or BRANDNAMEcompany.com just to make sure their brand name is in the domain somewhere. But from a consumer&amp;#39;s perspective, that&amp;#39;s really pretty confusing. When you&amp;#39;re looking for a brand on the internet, anything straying from BRANDNAME.EXTENSION seems like excess, and risks getting lost in the ether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) though, you can pair your brand name up with a memorable domain extension to create something easy to say, and even easier to remember. So instead of something like BRANDNAMEcoffeeroasters.com, you could just use BRANDNAME.coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Watch out when going too generic with gTLDs though&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of gTLDs opens you up to a lot of new naming possibilities, but remember that in search, you&amp;#39;re still going to be competing with existing brands. For instance, you might find joy in naming your apple orchard &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot;, with the domain name, apple.farm, but you&amp;#39;re going to have some pretty fierce competition (apple.com, applerecords.com) for the top Google spot for the term &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;. This isn&amp;#39;t to say that you should always shy away from names because of search competition, but be smart about it. The goal is to be the number one search term for your brand name (at least), so if that&amp;#39;s impossible, you may want to reconsider your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Beware of alternative spellings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a quick look at the variety of names people come up with for brands, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll find countless brand names, many of which are derivations of simple words or phrases. And that&amp;#39;s fine, but you have to be careful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The change should be noticeable&lt;/strong&gt; - Taking a look at the Product Hunt list, the top hit at the time of writing is Humin, a cool new phonebook app. Its domain, humin.com, is obviously a derivation of the word &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s short enough that people shouldn&amp;#39;t get too confused (although I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;d love to get their hands on human.com). Further down the list is a brand called Vint, which is also a a minor change, but is likely short enough for people to notice on first glance (although its domain name is joinvint.com, which I would say uses an unnecessary keyword).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain variations are normal in certain circles&lt;/strong&gt; - While I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend a grocery store to change their name to &amp;quot;foodr&amp;quot;, adding or removing certain letters (usually vowels) is totally fine in some circles. Becomr.com is a good example from the Product Hunt list, because the tech crowd they&amp;#39;re aiming for is likely used to that sort of change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But other variations aren&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; - Every common derivation had to start somewhere, but I&amp;#39;d be wary of being too original. For example, I found a brand called Kalibrr, which changes &amp;quot;caliber&amp;quot; by replacing the &amp;#39;c&amp;#39; with a &amp;#39;k&amp;#39; and uses &amp;#39;rr&amp;#39; at the end. It could work out fine for them, but I&amp;#39;d guess there will be some recall issues down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A word about domain hacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; a lot in the past, but for a brand&amp;#39;s primary site, they&amp;#39;re a hard sell for a couple reasons. First, they&amp;#39;re hard to verbalize. Instead of saying &amp;quot;BRANDNAME dot com&amp;quot;, you end up saying things like &amp;quot;BRANDNAME, with the end being dot I T&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;B R A N D N A dot M E&amp;quot;. Second, it&amp;#39;s only human nature to look at clever domain names as unprofessional. It certainly depends on the industry you&amp;#39;re in, but I&amp;#39;d think twice before putting my money in a bank using a domain like bankofthelak.es or bankingpl.us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;#39;s more about you than the name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what I, or anyone, says about your domain name in the planning stages, the popularity of your brand will likely come down to your product and how well you market it. I&amp;#39;ll always remember thinking how odd the name Google was when I first heard it (it&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Edk/google_name_origin.html&quot;&gt;misspelling of googol&lt;/a&gt;), and we all know how that turned out. So be brave, be smart and whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t settle on something you&amp;#39;re not happy with. Think of your domain like a marriage—it&amp;#39;s a longterm commitment, and getting out will probably hurt quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>HTTPS is now a Google ranking signal—learn how to make the switch</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google rankings. Just say the phrase and you&amp;#39;ll raise the blood pressure of countless website owners, because for as many professionals as there are trying to crack the search engine optimization (SEO) code, it&amp;#39;s still a moving target. New updates to the ranking algorithm are coming out all the time, and SEO practices that are considered &amp;#39;standard&amp;#39; one day might be damaging the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every once in a while Google will announce a very specific algorithm change that can be applied by nearly everyone, without any drastic changes to content or site structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html&quot;&gt;From Google&amp;#39;s Webmaster Central Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;over the past few months we’ve been running tests taking into account whether sites use secure, encrypted connections as a signal in our search ranking algorithms. We&amp;#39;ve seen positive results, so we&amp;#39;re starting to use HTTPS as a ranking signal. For now it&amp;#39;s only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Google is now starting to give a minor ranking boost to sites using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of the standard HTTP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So what can you do about it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free&quot;&gt;From Eric Mill:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick overview: to use HTTPS on the web today, you need to obtain a certificate file that&amp;#39;s signed by a company that browsers trust. Once you have it, you tell your web server where it is, where your associated private key is, and open up port 443 for business. You don&amp;#39;t necessarily have to be a professional software developer to do this, but you do need to be okay with the command line, and comfortable configuring a web server you control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in this boat, &lt;a href=&quot;https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free&quot;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt; goes on to show how to switch to HTTPS using StartSSL (it&amp;#39;s free for most sites), and then how to install it &amp;quot;via nginx, but you can use the certificate with whatever web server you want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/ssl&quot;&gt;preferred SSL certificate providers&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to do a bit of homework first to see which provider best fits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CloudFlare will soon be all HTTPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudflare.com/google-now-factoring-https-support-into-ranking-cloudflare-on-track-to-make-it-free-and-easy&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;, the popular content delivery network and distributed domain name server, is &amp;quot;on track to roll out SSL for all CloudFlare customers by mid-October (paid customers are already supported). When (they) do, the number of sites that support HTTPS on the Internet will more than double. That they&amp;#39;ll also rank a bit higher is pretty cool too.&amp;quot; So if you&amp;#39;re currently using CloudFlare for your website, you don&amp;#39;t need to do anything. If not, here&amp;#39;s the 90-second pitch, in video form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/14700285?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Need any help?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about HTTPS for your site, definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. While HTTPS might be a small ranking signal today, it can never hurt to make your site more secure—and more SEO optimized—for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t be a victim of domain hijacking</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Domain hijacking is probably the single worst thing that can happen to a website, and we want to make sure it never happens to you. So if you read anything today, please check out Domain Investing&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.domaininvesting.com/5-tips-prevent-domain-hijacking/&quot;&gt;5 Tips to Prevent Domain Hijacking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s a pretty short article, but the tips included are invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A quick security primer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking&quot;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt;—&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Domain hijacking&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;domain theft&lt;/strong&gt; is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of its original registrant.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, domain hijacking does indeed happen, so you should be absolutely certain that your domain is as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you want to make sure your passwords (for everything) can&amp;#39;t be cracked with simple social engineering (an educated guess based on public/shared knowledge about you). If your password is the name and age/birthday of your child, pet or spouse, it&amp;#39;s probably not good enough. If it&amp;#39;s your mother&amp;#39;s maiden name or your childhood street name, it&amp;#39;s also probably not good enough. Ideally, you want something totally random, and you also want to change it every few months. Pick something that has absolutely no meaning, rhyme or reason. And whatever you do, don&amp;#39;t get into the habit of using the same password for everything—that&amp;#39;s a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when your browser asks you to save a password, think twice. If your computer is ever stolen, those passwords will just pop up without any sort of extra protection. If you do want to save your passwords somewhere, consider using something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com/&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; to bury your saved passwords under a master password. Password managers can also generate  passwords for you with a visual representation how secure they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great tip is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1139898-how-can-i-enable-two-factor-authentication-&quot;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; (2FA), which forces you (and everyone else) to verify your identity by typing in a private code sent to your mobile device or 2FA app. So even if someone cracked your password remotely, they&amp;#39;d also need access to your phone to get in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one more tip for good measure—this one mentioned by someone in the Domain Investing article comments. Don&amp;#39;t give people access to your domain login credentials unless it&amp;#39;s absolutely necessary. If you do happen to use freelance developers for your site that need access, change all your passwords and login information once the work is done. And if you get any strange emails asking you to login to any of your accounts, don&amp;#39;t click on anything—it could be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing&quot;&gt;phishing scam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New domain extensions in the wild—an ongoing search</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve now launched more than 150 new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, and as expected, they&amp;#39;re each experiencing different levels of popularity. Some, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt;, .&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well, but none have blown up to the level of mass acceptance—none are considered normal yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to that point, we need to start seeing more of these sites in the wild. Ideally, a big brand will kickstart the movement by transitioning their .com to a new gTLD, but there are already a number of sites that have made the switch. Here are a few of the best/most interesting we&amp;#39;ve found so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.today/&quot;&gt;archive.today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fav.ninja/&quot;&gt;fav.ninja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://component.kitchen/&quot;&gt;component.kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://insane.domains/&quot;&gt;insane.domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://clever.land/&quot;&gt;clever.land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know of a site that should be on the list? Let us know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;d love to show it off.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gmail now recognizes addresses with accented and non-Latin characters</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-06-japanese-idn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Japanese IDN&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-first-step-toward-more-global-email.html&quot;&gt;From the Official Gmail Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, an organization called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a new email standard that supports addresses with non-Latin and accented Latin characters (e.g. 武＠メール.グーグル). In order for this standard to become a reality, every email provider and every website that asks you for your email address must adopt it. That’s obviously a tough hill to climb. The technology is there, but someone has to take the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;#39;re ready to be that someone. Starting now, Gmail (and shortly, Calendar) will recognize addresses that contain accented or non-Latin characters. This means Gmail users can send emails to, and receive emails from, people who have these characters in their email addresses. Of course, this is just a first step and there’s still a ways to go. In the future, we want to make it possible for you to use them to create Gmail accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hurdles for the adoption of non-Latin generic top-level domains (gTLDs) was the fact that their associated email addresses weren&amp;#39;t compatible with many of the most popular mail platforms. But now, with Gmail making the jump, we&amp;#39;re hopefully a few steps closer to a more welcoming web—one where characters from any language can be sent and recieved without hangups or restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A quick look at non-Latin gTLD popularity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because non-Latin gTLDs weren&amp;#39;t guaranteed to work in mail clients didn&amp;#39;t mean they weren&amp;#39;t popular though—four are currently sitting in the overall &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/&quot;&gt;top 100&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt; at #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&quot;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; at #18 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA&quot;&gt;.みんな&lt;/a&gt; at #91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%95%86%E5%9F%8E&quot;&gt;.商城&lt;/a&gt; at #94&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how much they grow in the following weeks after this announcement and the others that will hopefully follow. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at all to see a non-Latin gTLD in the top-5 by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Create a self-hosted WordPress site with iwantmyname and Bluehost</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-05-bluehost-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bluehost&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s one piece of advice we could give to someone who is starting a website or blog, it&amp;#39;s that you should take some time to pick the right web platform for your needs. Some are great for blogging, some for e-commerce, some for being social. And there&amp;#39;s always the option of creating something entirely custom—although you&amp;#39;d either need some web development know-how or the resources to hire someone. Most sites though (including many of the biggest on the web) are created with one of the many platforms currently available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For absolute beginners, we usually recommend a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;hosted solution&lt;/a&gt;—the platforms that bundle modern content management systems (CMS) with hosting space. They can cost a bit more, and you&amp;#39;ll lose some development flexibility, but the benefits of using something that&amp;#39;s truly plug-and-play often outweigh the lack of control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re comfortable managing your own hosting space, you&amp;#39;re open to a whole world of platforms that give you control over even the smallest details. And the most popular of these platforms is &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; (.org, not .com, which is a hosted platform), which in 2013 made up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/general-news/wordpress-infographic-2013-a-visual-representation-of-matts-state-of-the-word&quot;&gt;18.9%&lt;/a&gt; of the internet and was downloaded 46 million times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If WordPress is something you&amp;#39;re looking into, here&amp;#39;s a rundown of how to link your iwantmyname domain to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/&quot;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt;, one of our favorite web hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab a domain at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your domain is registered, select Setup in the top nav, then click &lt;em&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next to your domain, click the &lt;em&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/em&gt; link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Popular Settings&lt;/em&gt; dropdown menu, select &lt;em&gt;Bluehost&lt;/em&gt;, then click &lt;em&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/em&gt;. (Note: When you change your nameservers, one-click installs won&amp;#39;t work anymore. If you have any platforms currently installed like Bit.ly or Google Apps, you&amp;#39;ll need to reinstall those settings in your new Bluehost DNS manager.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-08-05-bluehost-ns.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bluehost NS&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;re setup on the iwantmyname end, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/&quot;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt; (or directly to Bluehost&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname?page=/managed-wordpress-hosting&quot;&gt;WordPress Optimized Hosting&lt;/a&gt; page) to get your hosting space. From there, you&amp;#39;ll have access the &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/home#main&quot;&gt;Bluehost admin page&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you easily install WordPress with your custom domain name. And that&amp;#39;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you need any additional help with the domain side of the equation, be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, the team at Bluehost should be able to answer any hosting-related questions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the new domain extensions of August, including .discount, .fitness and .wtf</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/meet-the-new-domain-extensions-of-july.html&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; was a bit of a slow month for new generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches, with only four cracking the 5,000-registrations mark &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-voting&quot;&gt;.voting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-services&quot;&gt;.services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kaufen&quot;&gt;.kaufen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&quot;&gt;.tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, which is now the 20th most popular gTLD overall. But things may be looking up for August, with nine gTLDs containing less than five characters (it&amp;#39;s thought that four or less may be the sweet spot for TLD popularity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially interesting is the August 13th launch of four medical-specific gTLDs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-care&quot;&gt;.care&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clinic&quot;&gt;.clinic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dental&quot;&gt;.dental&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-surgery&quot;&gt;.surgery&lt;/a&gt;. The usefulness of being able to type in something like LOCATION.clinic to get a relevant result is undeniable, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t be at all surprising to see some of these take off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;August Launch Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;August 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-schule&quot;&gt;.schule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, the big hole in this August list are new city gTLDs—you&amp;#39;ll have to wait until September 9th for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.london&lt;/a&gt;, then September 15th for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas&quot;&gt;.vegas&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the popularity of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&quot;&gt;.tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, I expect to see big-city TLDs dominating &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Launch discounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All discounts are launch/first year promos. Renewal prices will go back to the normal price in parenthesis after the first year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-fail&quot;&gt;.FAIL&lt;/a&gt;: $35 ($39)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rocks&quot;&gt;.ROCKS&lt;/a&gt;: $16.50 ($19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wtf&quot;&gt;.WTF&lt;/a&gt;: $35 ($39)&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>These off-kilter domain extensions could bring some interesting websites</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-31-wtf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wtf&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re big fans of all the new generic top-level domains (TLDs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&quot;&gt;coming out&lt;/a&gt;, but we have a fascination of sorts with the extensions that are particularly off-kilter. The ones that probably won&amp;#39;t be used for traditional company websites and blogs, but for strange creations and alternative microsites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, we have three launching—.fail, .rocks, and .wtf. And we don&amp;#39;t really have any expectations on their registration numbers, but we&amp;#39;re super interested in seeing what kinds of domains get created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re planning on creating a quirky website with these TLDs, we&amp;#39;re running a little sale (pre-orders are open, so get your name on the list before they&amp;#39;re open to the public). All we ask is that you share your creation—let us know what you&amp;#39;ve built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and maybe your site will appear in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The sale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All sales are launch/first year promos. Renewal prices will go back to the normal price in parenthesis after the first year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-fail&quot;&gt;.FAIL&lt;/a&gt;: $35 ($39)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rocks&quot;&gt;.ROCKS&lt;/a&gt;: $16.50 ($19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wtf&quot;&gt;.WTF&lt;/a&gt;: $35 ($39)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Searching for domains at iwantmyname just got a lot faster</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-30-new-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;new search&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You rarely think about the cogs that make things work when you&amp;#39;re browsing a site, but I&amp;#39;d like to direct your attention to our domain search—the big search bar on the homepage that lets you search for and buy domain names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept is a simple one. You type in a word, then our backend pings some servers and delivers a yes (available) or no (unavailable) for each top-level domain (TLD). A year ago, that wasn&amp;#39;t such a big deal to manage, but once the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) launched, the search quickly became a lumbering hulk. Every time you ran a search, hundreds of TLDs needed to be checked at once, and timeouts became more and more common. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of just waiting for our search to implode, we decided to completely rework the system. We&amp;#39;ll have a more technical post later on about what was accomplished, but the hyper-abridged version is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;the new search&lt;/a&gt; is much faster and infinitely more stable. And that&amp;#39;s a wonderful thing, because anything that gets in the way of you being able to register and manage domain names quickly is a big negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re so inclined, be sure to high-five &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kingersoll&quot;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ferrouswheel&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; for the update. They&amp;#39;re quite awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Trust errors are bad—here&#39;s how to fix expired intermediate SSL certificate chains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.digicert.com/expired-intermediate-certificate/&quot;&gt;From Flavio Martins - DigiCert:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 26,2014 at 12:15 PM, some customers and users on sites secured by DigiCert reported that they were getting an untrusted certificate error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is related to a locally installed legacy intermediate certificate that is no longer used and no longer required for the certificate installation. The problem can affect any client platform with a locally cached or installed intermediate certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use (and really like) DigiCert for SSL, but it looks like there&amp;#39;s been a minor hiccup for some users. If you&amp;#39;re getting an untrusted certificate error when you visit iwantmyname, this is a great (and easy) step-by-step guide on how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you need any additional help, definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Get your .kiwi domain name before August 6th and you could win $1,000 NZD</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;100+&lt;/a&gt; new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) we&amp;#39;ve launched this year, none represent our little corner of the Earth (we&amp;#39;re based in New Zealand) better than &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.kiwi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, to promote the quirkiest little domain extension on the web, we&amp;#39;re excited to announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.promotion.kiwi/truecolours/&quot;&gt;a contest&lt;/a&gt;, brought to you by our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://hello.kiwi/&quot;&gt;Dot Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The contest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now until 6 August 2014 (11:59 PM NZST), every .kiwi domain you register at iwantmyname counts as an entry to win $1,000 NZD from Dot Kiwi (&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://promotion.kiwi/terms/&quot;&gt;terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re a New Zealander, or just love the .kiwi domain, and are planning to start a website or blog in the foreseeable future, now&amp;#39;s the time to grab your domain—because nothing (seriously, nothing) is better than winning money for obtaining something you&amp;#39;ll actually use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And to make it better, a .kiwi sale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the contest even more appealing, we&amp;#39;re dropping the price of .kiwi from $35.90/yr to $27.50/yr ($29.90 NZD). It&amp;#39;s the least we can do to spread the love of New Zealand&amp;#39;s most unique TLD.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Watch Vint Cerf explain the NTIA transition (he rides a giant cat at the end)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We typically like to spare our customers the politics of the web, but Vint Cerf, the &amp;quot;father of the internet&amp;quot; (who now works for Google) recently narrated a great video explaining the transition of internet oversight from the influence of the NTIA (a US government organization) to the more global ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s short, educational, and has a great frame at 2:22 where a drawn depiction of Vint Cerf is sitting on top of a giant angry cat under a rainbow (I believe he just won the internet). &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Building an audience or community for your website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We regularly post articles to help you get started with your own website, whether it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/a-detailed-breakdown-of-what-small-business-websites-cost.html&quot;&gt;expected costs for a business site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/build-a-modern-hosted-photo-gallery-website.html&quot;&gt;how to economically showcase your photos&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/squarespace-iwantmyname-makes-website-building-a-snap.html&quot;&gt;really easy ways to get a domain and site up and running&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then what? In the same way that just buying a domain won&amp;#39;t magically make a website appear, getting your website online won&amp;#39;t magically make customers, audience, or community appear. As a side note, while SEO can be an important part of building your presence online, we&amp;#39;re not going to get into it in this post, as that&amp;#39;s a whole other big, complex topic. For an intro though, &lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo&quot;&gt;this is a great start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at some things to think about and research. We&amp;#39;ll also get into some actions to take to build your profile and engagement online and encourage people to visit your site. You could be trying to grow your customer base, build a community, or assemble an audience/fan base. People are people no matter how you&amp;#39;re interacting with them, so these tactics can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are you trying to build?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like an obvious one, but there are often nuances. In the same way a startup&amp;#39;s target market isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot;, neither is the target audience or community for your site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People want it to be clear if they&amp;#39;re being sold something. They rarely like it if they think they&amp;#39;re just hanging out with friends... and then get pitched. If you&amp;#39;re building a small business, great, be friendly and welcoming, but also keep in mind the things people want from a business website. That is, clear information about the products or services, pricing, shipping, ways to contact you, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re trying to grow a community around a shared interest or other catalyst, you need to have a clear idea of who you want the community members to be. How will you design the site, functions, and onboarding process to make it as attractive to the right potential members as possible? If someone stumbles upon it expecting something entirely different they&amp;#39;re likely to end up frustrated, and it can be awkward for existing members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for an audience, note that developing it can be quite different from building community, and is not intended to be fully interactive, but rather more broadcast-centric. Internet culture these days tends to be such that many people expect interactions to be inclusive (think Reddit or parenting blogger communities). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop your personal or business brand and build an audience, you&amp;#39;ll need to think more along the lines of celebrities, athletes, etc. whose sites are developed more to broadcast and share information with their fans, but not necessarily to interact with them on a large scale. (Though many of these sites have fan community areas where fans can interact with each other.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who else is doing what you want to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very unlikely that you are the first or only person doing what you want to do. (And if you are, there&amp;#39;s probably a good reason there aren&amp;#39;t others.) It may be a sparsely populated niche; it may be be well established and thriving. Do your research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know who the well-known names and established communities are. What are the sucessful brands? How do they approach and interact with others, and what do they focus on? What do they do that is popular and that you would like to do, too? (As the saying goes, good artists borrow, great artists steal...) This is not to say that you should just copy wholesale what others are doing, but there are tried and true methods to build audience, sales, and community interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other big reasons to know who the other people in your area are is that one of the best ways to build your own presence is by getting out there. Interact with others and enhance their experience where you can. Don&amp;#39;t sit and wait for them to come to you. Join in, be part of existing communities. It&amp;#39;s also important to note where your target audience or community hangs out online. Not all groups use the same sites or tools, nor are all sites or tools well suited to all kinds of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is not to say you should just show up on others&amp;#39; sites, blogs, or forums and start spouting off about how great you are or your stuff is and how much everything else sucks and how they should all come to you. Remember, this is a social sphere like any other, and you&amp;#39;re the newcomer. Read, pay attention. Learn who the main players are, who the lurkers are, what topics are popular. Then, if there&amp;#39;s an opportunity to genuinely share an opinion or expertise, feel free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your contributions are useful and you&amp;#39;re pleasant and respectful, people will be interested in who you are, and may go check out your site or social profiles. Becoming part of a community (or the leader of one) or building a loyal customer base doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight. And particularly online, people don&amp;#39;t expect to be talked at or imposed upon. We all need to earn our places and prove our value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re starting a business, when you have great interactions with people who become fans, ask for testimonials you can showcase. If potential customers have trouble, ask what went wrong and how you can improve the experience. If you&amp;#39;re fortunate, they will become better evangelists for you than you can ever be for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Create great content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do get people interested in who you are and what you do, make sure to keep them interested when they come to check you out. Recall the answers you decided on about what you want to build. You need to have a site that welcomes visitors, tells them what they want to know, and encourages them to stay. That could include great blog posts/articles, sharing of practical information, or a user-friendly store offering great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your own site is only one part of showing who you are and what you can do online, but it is a big part, and it&amp;#39;s a part over which you have full control. (Unlike third-party sites/communities or social media.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, this is also one of the best SEO approaches as well. There is no button to click or form on which to submit your site to get great results in Google and other searches. But creating great content and building a site that people like using and coming back to will help you rise in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there&amp;#39;s no ideal solution for building an online presence, audience, or community that doesn&amp;#39;t require time, hard work, and paying attention to the world around you. But putting in the effort &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; pay off. No one owes you their attention online, so remembering how you like to experience sites and interact with people and doing your best to replicate and improve upon that is a great set of first steps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;And, of course, registering a great domain name.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>6 tips for choosing a domain name for fundraising</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donationto.com/&quot;&gt;DonationTo&lt;/a&gt; is an easy-to-use fundraising website that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/register-domain-donationto&quot;&gt;integrated with iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy to use personalized domain names when crowd-funding online. The method is rather easy—it takes just five minutes to create a fundraising page at DonationTo and just a few moments more to purchase and plug in your domain name with iwantmyname. And by the end, you&amp;#39;ll have a great, easy-to-remember domain such as &amp;#39;james-fighting-cancer.com&amp;#39; as your hub for accepting donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons to use personal domain names for crowd-funding pages, first of which is the fact that they make it easier for supporters to draw connections between who you are (friend/family) and what they are supposed to do (donate). After all, it&amp;#39;s important to recognize that many people will not immediately visit your page, so you&amp;#39;ll want to provide them with a relevant domain name that&amp;#39;s easy to remember for future reference. Taking this approach will help increase the total amount of contributions you&amp;#39;ll receive, and will help show your commitment to hitting your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major benefit of attaching a custom domain name to your crowd-funding page is that it will build legitimacy for your cause. People are exposed to hundreds of online fundraising campaigns each year, so you should take every possible step to make it yours a trusted option for them to financially support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the right domain name can be intimidating for some people though, so we&amp;#39;ve compiled a list of proven tips that will help you get the most out of the name you choose to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Selecting the correct domain extension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you begin contemplating what your online fundraising domain name will be, you need to choose the domain extension (.net, .com, .io, .org, etc.) that makes the most sense for your particular cause. Although most people automatically assume that .com makes the most sense, this is not always the case. For example, if you&amp;#39;re hosting a fundraiser specifically for a cause based in Japan, it could be beneficial to add a local touch by selecting the .jp domain extension. After all, going with a country-specific domain name may help capture the attention of local supporters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your fundraiser has global appeal, it could be wise to choose .com or a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domain&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see, there&amp;#39;s quite a lot to think about before you lock yourself into any specific domain extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to note about extensions is that they can alter a potential supporter&amp;#39;s perception of your efforts to crowd-fund. For instance, while .com has become synonymous with almost any type of website, the reality is that it was created for sites of a more business nature (com stands for commercial), whereas the original purpose of .org was to provide a resource for organizations—often nonprofits. Due to this, .org might be more appealing for some charity campaigns, but you should still carefully consider utilizing .com because it may be easier for some people to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Choosing your domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy for people to become overwhelmed with all the potential
possibilities, but there is a very simple way for most to settle on a name that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your domain name should be your company name.&amp;quot; Christopher Heng from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/domainname.shtml&quot;&gt;thesitewizard.com&lt;/a&gt; explains that while naming domains after company names may seem obvious to some, a surprising amount of domains aren&amp;#39;t correlated at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, how confusing it would be if your nonprofit was known by a name that was completely different from your domain name. It would be much harder to reach from memory, and would likely prevent people from visiting the site at all. And that, in turn, could make overall donations suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important reminder is that you want search engines to be on your side. If you&amp;#39;re a nonprofit organization, supporters are going to look to make online donations by entering your organization&amp;#39;s name into their favorite search engine. But if your organization&amp;#39;s name and your domain name aren&amp;#39;t related, search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo might not be able to link to the appropriate content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Choosing a name without an organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people worldwide crowd-funding for a variety of reasons—medical, memorial, natural disasters—and many of them aren&amp;#39;t associated with any specific organization. If this is the case for your campaign, it may seem daunting to pick an appropriate domain name. However, there is a simple process to help you land on a name that will be easy for supporters to remember. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tip is to use your domain name to tell people who you are and what you&amp;#39;re raising money for. For example, if you have a friend named James who is currently fighting cancer, james-fighting-cancer.com would be a good choice. Anyone who knows James will draw the connection—this donation is for James, and the money will go towards his medical bills to fight cancer. It&amp;#39;s this logical process we&amp;#39;re looking to achieve, and it can be all done with a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point to note is the use of hyphens in the domain name above (james-fighting-cancer.com). While some may question the use of hyphens, our experience indicates that they can actually add much-needed clarity. As an added bonus, choosing longer domains  such as james-fighting-cancer.com or james-medical-fundraising.com are much more likely to be available (buying domains that are already registered can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html&quot;&gt;quite expensive&lt;/a&gt;), and are extremely easy to read and remember. And from a search engine perspective, hyphens are ok because they&amp;#39;re just treated as spaces between words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tip is to think about specificity. If you choose to use a longer domain, make sure it&amp;#39;s as precise as possible. For instance, james-fighting-cancer.com is good, but maybe james-medical-fundraising.com would add an extra layer of specificity. It&amp;#39;s a good idea to be very up front with your needs, and james-medical-fundraising.com clearly spells out the fact that you&amp;#39;re raising money for James&amp;#39; medical bills. Choosing the right words will vary from case to case, so use your best judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Keep it simple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous tip we explained that it&amp;#39;s perfectly acceptable to utilize hyphens for clarity in your domain name, however, there is the danger of incorporating &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt; words or hyphens. Typically more than three hyphens will confuse your visitors, and even if you choose not use hyphens, that amount of words strung together can be confusing to read and even harder to memorize. It&amp;#39;s also important to note that domain names that are more than four words long run the risk of being cut off by link services like Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to stick with a name that utilizes three or fewer words and hyphens. And if you follow the adage of keeping it simple, you&amp;#39;ll never need to worry about character limits or domains that are too hard to memorize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Oversimplification is bad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve touched base on the importance of keeping your domain name simple, you might be thinking about doing things that could actually hurt your goal. Therefore, it&amp;#39;s critical to learn the difference between a simple domain name and an oversimplified one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your friend goes by the name DJ, it would make perfect sense to choose dj-medical-fundraising.com as your domain name. However, it would be an oversimplification to select DJMF.com, as this has no easily discernible meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trend that you may want to avoid is choosing a country extension in order to make a creative word. For example, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2008/10/23/how-to-get-yourself-a-sweet-ly-domain-name/&quot;&gt;used to be popular&lt;/a&gt; to choose an English word then add .ly at the end such as useful.ly, but the practice has fallen out of favor recently because it&amp;#39;s generally harder to verbalize these &amp;quot;domain hacks,&amp;quot; and because they&amp;#39;re unusual, they can be more difficult to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that keeping it simple without oversimplifying, using so-called cute wordplay or being overly clever is always the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. The decision of whether or not to use numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is typically suggested that numbers should not be incorporated into domain names, but there are some compelling arguments for them. For example, the Internet provides access to the entire world, and numbers are often used to convey meaning in other languages (like Chinese, as highlighted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFTW_abinnM&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;). Another good use of numbers to increase specificity without using too many characters—like if you&amp;#39;re raising money to pay for an 88th birthday party. Spelling out 88 would make your domain name unnecessarily long and would most likely confuse people, so choosing something like james-88th-birthday.com or james-88th-fundraiser.com would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember to use common sense when determining if numbers are appropriate for your domain. If they&amp;#39;re culturally relevant or make things more specific, they may indeed be helpful for people trying to find your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online fundraising is rather popular today, and with DonationTo you can get your fundraising page up in just a few minutes. And with an iwantmyname domain name, the whole process is easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you make your selection, follow our six tips to point you in the right direction for clarity and legibility as you share your domain name across email and all your social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1pm, 30 September 2014, ‘second level’ domains like the .co in ‘.co.nz’ and the .org in ‘.org.nz’ will become optional. You’ll be able to get .nz names with them, without them, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain English, the .NZ domain extension will be open to the public on September 30th at 1pm (hooray!). And if you&amp;#39;re a current owner of a .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ, etc. domain, you&amp;#39;ll have a two-year safe period to reserve your corresponding .NZ domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be sending out more specific details closer to the launch date, but in the meantime there are two things you can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to know more about the .NZ domain extension, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyname.nz/&quot;&gt;anyname.nz&lt;/a&gt;. The site has a bevy of information, including the full infographic seen above, additional information about registering your corresponding .NZ domain and a nice introduction video if you&amp;#39;re interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to make sure you&amp;#39;re at the head of the line to get a brand new .NZ domain, we have an easy-to-remember page for .NZ pre-orders—&lt;a href=&quot;http://dropthecofromyour.co.nz&quot;&gt;dropthecofromyour.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; (which is, &amp;quot;drop the co from your .co.nz&amp;quot;...we kind of love &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Watch out for this domain name certificate scam</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From ICANN, in an article titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2014-07-15-en&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Fraudulent ICANN Domain Name Certificates&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been brought to ICANN&amp;#39;s attention that some online entities have attempted to sell fraudulent &amp;quot;certificates&amp;quot;, which they claim are required to protect generic top-level domain names. The perpetuators of this scam threaten registrants on the protection service with the objective of securing a fee from the registrant. The &amp;quot;certificates&amp;quot; look official and include an unauthorized use of the ICANN logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-18-icann-fraud-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fraud&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that ICANN does not issue certificates to registrants and does not collect fees from registrants directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you come across anyone trying to sell you a fraudulent certificate like this (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/sites/default/files/assets/fraud-example-700x917-2-16jul14-zh.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;), please steer clear. And if you ever have a question about the authenticity of anything domain related, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re always here to help&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A look at the most popular sites using new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic-top level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) have been a moderate success up to this point. If you take a look at ntldstat.com&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;new gTLD registrations chart&lt;/a&gt;, you won&amp;#39;t find dramatic gains, but the line is consistently trending upwards with more gTLDs coming out each week. And that&amp;#39;s not likely to change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point though, the success of the new gTLDs won&amp;#39;t be determined by numbers (numbers can be skewed), but by visibility. Specifically, by the amount of big sites that use gTLDs as their primary internet outposts. So while we wait for BMW.com to become BMW.auto, we can hold ourselves over with Domain Incite Pro&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/pro/popular-new-gtld-domains/&quot;&gt;newly released feature&lt;/a&gt; that tracks sites using new gTLDs by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/topsites&quot;&gt;Alexa Rank&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t any sites using gTLDs in the Alexa top 500 yet, but there are 34 in the top 100,000 (which is a big deal considering the new domain extensions are still fairly new). I won&amp;#39;t list them out individually (some could be malicious), but breaking them out by gTLD shows some pretty interesting trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&quot;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt; 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land&quot;&gt;.LAND&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&quot;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ninja&quot;&gt;.NINJA&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&quot;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&quot;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center&quot;&gt;.CENTER&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&quot;&gt;.DIRECTORY&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics&quot;&gt;.GRAPHICS&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-marketing&quot;&gt;.MARKETING&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&quot;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-trade&quot;&gt;.TRADE&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&quot;&gt;.XYZ&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-zone&quot;&gt;.ZONE&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorter TLDs seem to be doing much better than longer ones (which makes sense), with only five of the top 34 having more than a five-letter domain extension. If this trend holds, it doesn&amp;#39;t bode well for the longer gTLDs yet to come out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.XYZ, the top gTLD in overall registrations, only appears once in the Alexa top 100,000. Given its relative newness, this doesn&amp;#39;t come as too much of a surprise, but it&amp;#39;s hard to know what percentage of its 300,000+ applications are just junk to inflate stats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CLUB has been quite aggressive with their marketing (in certain circles), and it&amp;#39;s paid off, making up more than 25% of the list. Poor 50 Cent&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://50inda.club/&quot;&gt;50inda.club&lt;/a&gt; site didn&amp;#39;t make the Alexa top million though. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.GURU was the leader on the overall popularity list for a good amount of time (it&amp;#39;s currently in fourth), but only one of its sites made the list. Sure, it&amp;#39;s the most popular site on the Alexa list at #710, but I do wonder how popular .GURU will be once the initial popularity wears off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general thought is that if gTLDs are ever going to become truly popular, more than one will have to hit it big. And with 16 different domain extensions on the list, the popularity is spread out pretty evenly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Web platforms and naming tips for building amazing restaurant sites (updated!)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a restaurant is a hard business, and as more and more customers choose to dine at places with good design aesthetics, it&amp;#39;s become increasingly important to have a similarly beautiful website. But going with an agency or freelancer to build your site can be quite expensive, so it may be wise to make your site yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately we&amp;#39;re not living in the early 2000&amp;#39;s, a time when cheesy Flash site creators using animated banners were all the rage. The web platforms of today can help even the most novice restauranteurs create slick, responsive sites with integrated social platforms and menu systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to make things easy, here are four modern platforms from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, as well as a batch of great naming suggestions to make your site as easy to find as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discoverability is all in a name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the perfect domain name can be just as important as building a great site. And if you only take one thing from this post, it should be that &lt;strong&gt;your domain name should be the same as your company name&lt;/strong&gt;. Most restaurants will likely try to grab a .com first, but don&amp;#39;t sacrifice memorability just so you can have a specific domain extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your company name is Bar Chris (and barchris.com is taken), don&amp;#39;t register something like barchrisyum.com just to be in the .com namespace. It&amp;#39;ll just confuse people—and besides, there are so many great alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 1: Look for something local&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#39;re in the US, country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are extremely popular and can significantly open up your naming options. For instance, if you&amp;#39;re looking to open a bakery in Canada, you may find it easier to find a short, descriptive domain in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;.ca&lt;/a&gt; namespace than .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 2: Even local-er&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more direct that the ccTLDs are the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/cities-are-a-good-bet-for-new-domain-extension-success.html&quot;&gt;city domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;#39;ll want to be careful not to put yourself in too much of a box, but if you&amp;#39;re not looking to expand to other cities (or you plan on registering in each new city you move to), there are a bunch of great cities with their own TLDs now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-paris&quot;&gt;.Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-moscow&quot;&gt;.Moscow&lt;/a&gt;—the list goes on and on, and more cities will surely be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 3: Try a generic term&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third option is to do away with localization altogether, and instead move to a TLD that better categorizes your domain on the web. Just as .com stands for commercial, these domain extensions actually mean something—and they can be a benefit for domain recall (BOBSPIZZA.london might not stick, but BOBS.pizza is nice and memorable):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pub&quot;&gt;.PUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bar&quot;&gt;.BAR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rest&quot;&gt;.REST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cafe&quot;&gt;.CAFE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-eat&quot;&gt;.EAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-food&quot;&gt;.FOOD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kitchen&quot;&gt;.KITCHEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza&quot;&gt;.PIZZA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 DIY platforms for building your site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your name in place, here are some nice platforms to try out. All offer modern templates and great features, and are perfect for people with little-to-no development knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/tour/restaurants&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;quot;Say goodbye to Flash websites and PDF menus. Squarespace makes exceptional design and modern functionality available to all restaurants. Best of all, it&amp;#39;s a piece of cake to update yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace does a lot right with its simple website template system. With no design or development skill, you can create a responsive site (meaning it resizes automatically for any screen size) with beautiful photography, a great menu system, OpenTable integration, social connections and even an online sales platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-10-squarespace-restaurant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://virb.com/restaurants&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;quot;Virb makes it easy to serve up a great website for your hungry guests, with simple tools and features to keep up with your fast-moving world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Squarespace, Virb is a comprehensive site builder that has entered the restaurant market in a big way. With no dev background, you get a number of beautiful templates with menu systems, contact pages, social integrations and OpenTable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-10-virb-restaurant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Virb&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/site-hungry-for-restaurants&quot;&gt;Site Hungry&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sitehungry.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;quot;Site Hungry allows you to set up a brand new restaurant website in less than 5 minutes. Share all of your restaurant&amp;#39;s hours, location and contact information, menu, and social media in one place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Squarespace and Virb, the Site Hungry platform is 100% dedicated to building restaurant sites. And as far as ease of use goes, it may be the easiest to get up and running. The platform doesn&amp;#39;t quite have the full feature-set of the bigger, more established platforms yet, but I&amp;#39;d expect steady growth as the user-base grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/custom-domain-letseatat&quot;&gt;LetsEat&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letseat.at/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s Eat is made for busy people who want to update their menu specials on the fly, not deal with HTML and JavaScript. It is an advanced restaurant website builder that doesn&amp;#39;t come with a steep learning curve.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LetsEat is another restaurant-only platform that integrates menus, photography and social together to create clean, simple sites. But the differentiator for LetsEat is its &amp;quot;app store.&amp;quot; With little effort, you can integrate services like OpenTable, Constant Contact, OpenDining, Taskvilla and SeatMe to create exactly the site you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-10-letseat-restaurant.png&quot; alt=&quot;LetsEat&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Looking for an amazing UI designer</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname has made quite a few changes over the last few months. We&amp;#39;ve expanded our team to ten with the recent addition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/say-hi-to-the-10th-iwantmynamer-travis-holton.html&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ve added a ton of great documentation to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;Support Center&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#39;re constantly improving our backend to make it faster and more stable than ever. But there&amp;#39;s still one gap in our collective skillset that we need to fill—UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Calling all UI designers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal now is to find someone who can come in and make the iwantmyname UI something special. Specifically, we&amp;#39;re looking for someone with great design chops and a love for usability and accessibility who is organized enough to work with a team scattered all around the world. We&amp;#39;re based in Wellington, New Zealand, but it&amp;#39;s a truly global company, with employees who live full-time and part-time in Europe, North America or wherever they happen to be at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you think you&amp;#39;re a good fit (or know someone who is), head over to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/ui-designer&quot;&gt;jobs page&lt;/a&gt; for more information and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>John O&#39;Nolan has some tips for overcoming blogger&#39;s block</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging has gotten a bad rap over the last few years because the medium is inundated with so much noise. But starting and maintaining a good (i.e. useful) blog takes an amazing amount of dedication to a very specific window of interest, which is why it&amp;#39;s so rare to see blogs that are more than a year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to staying engaged with a specific topic is to always have something to say, and for that, we have a great post from John O&amp;#39;Nolan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, titled &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ghost.org/great-blog-post-ideas/&quot;&gt;How To Come up with Great Ideas for Blog Posts, Every Single Time&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I write about now? What do I have to say that&amp;#39;s important enough to be worth publishing? Will anyone even care? This isn&amp;#39;t working. I&amp;#39;ll try again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking often forces us to repress ideas and throw them into the &amp;quot;not worth publishing&amp;quot; bucket. It&amp;#39;s a shame, because it stifles creativity. This is why we&amp;#39;re often left staring at computer screens knowing that we should publish something, but unable to decide on exactly what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this: Today we&amp;#39;re going to look at some tried and tested techniques for coming up with blog post ideas even when you feel like you&amp;#39;ve got no creativity left to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piggybacking on this topic, another great post strategy is to send people to useful articles other people have written (how meta...a blog post highlighting a blog post about blogging!). There&amp;#39;s absolutely no shame in becoming a trusted resource for finding other trusted resources.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A detailed breakdown of what small business websites cost</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever put down for a high quality website knows the costs associated. You&amp;#39;re paying for planning, hosting, design, strategy, and all sorts of other minute details that go into creating a polished domain. But getting an idea of what those costs will look like can be hard—here&amp;#39;s a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.executionists.com/blog/cost-to-build-websites-2014/&quot;&gt;From Executionists:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A business owner asked 3 development companies to submit a proposal to design her company website. She supplied the developers with the same ‘requirements document’ that listed the website goals and functions.  A week later the three web developers came back to the client with their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one had priced the project at $2,800, the second had priced it at $5,500 and the final web developer estimated the project at $13,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re waiting for the punch line… well, there isn’t one.  That’s because the joke is on the client who now needs to figure out which of these estimates is the most reasonable and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago we published one of our highest viewed blog articles describing, how much a small business website costs to design to educate those stumped by the costs and process of building a small business website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in 2014, were updating it again (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.executionists.com/blog/cost-to-build-websites-2014/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with additional approaches to determine how much a small business website should really cost by factoring in advances in technology and the current costs associated with designing, developing and building a website. Please note, when we say “small business” we are talking about an informational website consisting of approximately 10 – 20 pages with some basic content management and social media widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re gearing up for a big web project, this is a great introduction to what you&amp;#39;re in for. Some of these costs can be minimized with personal expertise, but crucial tasks like design, strategy and development should never be skimped on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; ways to cut down on the price though if your budget can&amp;#39;t take the hit. All-in-one hosted platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address&quot;&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt; offer drag-and-drop site building and are robust enough to handle anything if enough care is taken. Also, sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://99designs.com/&quot;&gt;99Designs&lt;/a&gt; can be a wonderful resource for design needs, but don&amp;#39;t overlook the benefits of working closely with a good local designer, especially if you&amp;#39;re still in the process of creating initial brand standards. And don&amp;#39;t dismiss the power of new web tools—sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.co/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; are wonderful for discovering new platforms and services that can help you in all sorts of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Build a modern, hosted photo gallery website for under $10 a month</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big life events tend to be accompanied by countless images of every important moment, but in today&amp;#39;s digital world, what happens after that? You&amp;#39;re probably not going to print them all for a book, and uploading them all to large photo-storage sites seems rather impersonal. For photos like these, you need something you can customize to fit your style without any sort of platform branding slapped on top, with optional password protection for privacy if you need it. And of course it shoud also work with your very own custom domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are a ton of great options available. Some edgy and modern, and some more flexible and subdued. And best of all, they&amp;#39;re not going to cost you a fortune to maintain. For $10 USD or less, you can create something quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SmugMug&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/own-domain-on-smugmug-portfolio&quot;&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt; was built for preserving your digital photos on a nice, clean website. And it goes above and beyond to make sharing easy, with simple downloads, social connectivity and a platform to turn photos into prints or products for easy gifting. If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smugmug.com/features&quot;&gt;bill annually&lt;/a&gt;, the Power tier is only $5/mo billed annually, and gives you unlimited photo uploads and design control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-10-smugmug-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;SmugMug&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nicolesyblog.com/2013/07/31/the-new-smugmug/&quot;&gt;Nicolesy Blog&lt;/a&gt;, which also has a nice description of the changes SmugMug made from their old platform to their new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zenfolio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/zenfolio-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Zenfolio&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more well known photography specific platforms, and was built &amp;quot;for photographers – both amateur and professional – to organize, display, and sell their images with uncompromising quality.&amp;quot; To use your own domain name you&amp;#39;ll need the Unlimited &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.zenfolio.com/zf/signup/plans.aspx&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;, which offers unlimited storage for $5/mo billed annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-10-zenfolio-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zenfolio&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/4ormat-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Format&lt;/a&gt; (which recently changed from 4ormat) is billed as a site for creative professionals to build an online portfolio, but its clean templates, flexible pages and slick blog integration makes it a wonderful option for amateur photographers and adventurers. Basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://format.com/plans&quot;&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; are $5.75/mo billed annually, and give you 50 pages, 100 images and 100 videos to play around with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-10-format.png&quot; alt=&quot;Format&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Salon.io&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/domain-customize-salonio&quot;&gt;Salon.io&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely unique platform, as it gives you control of your layout like none other. You start with a completely blank canvas (no templates), then add in photos and videos and embeds in fixed width, variable size or completely user-controlled grids. The Basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://salon.io/join&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; includes everything most users will need (10 pages, 500 images), and costs 29€ for a lifetime membership (no recurring payments!), but to get password protection you&amp;#39;ll need the Easy Business plan, which is 99€/year, slightly above the $10/mo threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-10-salon-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;Salon.io&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exposure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/exposure-photo-websites&quot;&gt;Exposure&lt;/a&gt; is a bit different than the standard photo gallery platform—it&amp;#39;s meant to give people the chance to weave photos into a narrative. To turn your grand adventures into something more than just a collection of photos with no context. &lt;a href=&quot;https://exposure.co/subscribe&quot;&gt;Prices&lt;/a&gt; are hard to find before you sign up, but maintaining a Pro account (which give you custom domain support) costs $8.25/mo if billed annually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-10-exposure-template.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exposure&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Squarespace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; has been around for quite a while in web years, and now in its sixth iteration, it&amp;#39;s become one of the web&amp;#39;s leading platforms for creating striking sites with minimal effort. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;Plans&lt;/a&gt; with unlimited storage start at $16/mo if billed annually, but the $8/mo annual plan has plenty of space for most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-10-squarespace-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Virb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; is a versatile platform for all kinds of websites, but one of its best features is how its templates beautifully display photos. And Virb &lt;a href=&quot;http://virb.com/pricing&quot;&gt;makes pricing easy&lt;/a&gt;, with unlimited everything, including pages, photos and customization options for a flat $10/mo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-07-09-virb-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;Virb&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;500px&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio/500px-custom-domain-registration&quot;&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#39;t a traditional photo gallery site—it&amp;#39;s more of a social network for discovering great photography. And it&amp;#39;s really awesome if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re looking for, but for traditional photo galleries it may have been a bit much. Before you decide, take a look at what the platform offers, as well as the &amp;quot;Awesome&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://500px.com/upgrade&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you the ability to create your own site within the 500px community for $6.25/mo billed annually.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to help your company not .SUCK</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris recently posted an article about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/8-alternatives-to-com-for-review-websites.html&quot;&gt;alternatives to .COM for review websites&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great place to start if you&amp;#39;re interested in starting a reviews site for anything from cameras to cafés. But what if you&amp;#39;re part of a company or organization and concerned about reviews for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; products or services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Approach it with the right perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many misguided companies have learned, no one controls the Internet, or how people act or what is posted on it. You only control what you post and how you respond to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be able to prevent people from expressing themselves on your company&amp;#39;s website or social media properties, but if they&amp;#39;re upset about something, that just means they&amp;#39;ll go elsewhere to do it. And hey, there&amp;#39;s a whole new world of &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; or, coming soon &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.sucks&lt;/em&gt; out there these days. A better focus would be on not needing to try and bury the bad reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing to understand is that no matter how hard-working and well-meaning a company is, eventually everyone has a misstep or customer who they just can&amp;#39;t make happy. The question is how to address it, turn it around if possible, and keep the negative comments off the first page of search results or Buzzfeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Questions to ask before getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the best ways to create a good balance? How can you publicize all your happy customers, your awesome products and services, and your stellar customer service, while still addressing real issues? While keeping in mind, of course, that there are people who are only &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; when they&amp;#39;re trashing others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, ensure you have a solid policy in place before embarking on the great adventure that is the Internet. Some questions you&amp;#39;ll need to answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your company doesn&amp;#39;t yet have a website, what domain(s) will you choose? (What&amp;#39;s available, memorable, and best reflects your business, products, services, or culture?) With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions_&quot;&gt;all the new gTLDs available and yet to be launched&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;#39;s more choice than ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On what sites will you have a presence? (I.e. where will you create your company&amp;#39;s own accounts/sites/properties.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the common terms that people might use to look for or talk about your company or products? (These should include both the official nomenclature of your company, and words and phrases that customers and others use.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On what sites will you engage with customers, prospects, and others? (This means both your own properties and other third-party sites and accounts where others may be talking about you.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kinds of content will you post? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the content you post differ by property, audience, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via what channels do you want people to contact your company? (E.g. email, phone, chat, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via what channels will you offer support? (If you choose not to support a common channel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/its-not-that-your-call-isnt-important-to-us.html&quot;&gt;like the phone&lt;/a&gt;, make that very public and clear and make it easy to contact your company in other ways.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is going to have access to post content and respond to others who engage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your standard policy regarding complaints? (Be familiar with and clear on legitimate complaints or criticisms and trolling.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When do you respond to complaints and when do you ignore them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your escalation policy regarding complaints?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your timeline for responding to people, whether it&amp;#39;s comments, questions, or complaints? (On the Internet, you can never respond &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your policy regarding unfounded complaints? These can include, but aren&amp;#39;t limited to people who are...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spreading misinformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have never been customers and are just ranting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are secretly competitors trying to make the competition look bad (as a general rule, never talk about the competition, especially to bad mouth them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are trying to spread hate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may not be mentally stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are angry for reasons beyond your control, like your company simply doesn&amp;#39;t do something they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your company should have a solid understanding and policy for all of these things before engaging online, else you&amp;#39;re likely to find yourself scrambling when something goes wrong some day. This could happen when your company screws something up, when there&amp;#39;s big (bad) news in your industry, or for many other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;#39;t sharecrop, register a domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as social media has become pretty thoroughly integrated into consumers&amp;#39; and companies&amp;#39; online experiences, it&amp;#39;s still a good idea to have your own web properties. Certainly you can brand and monitor third-party sites, but having your own provides your company with a solid and centralized online identity. (&amp;quot;Sharecropping&amp;quot; refers to relying on third-party services, platforms, and companies you don&amp;#39;t own or control for functions that are essential to your business.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides a destination with your branding, correct and comprehensive information about your company, and a single location to receive questions, comments, and concerns (and potentially post replies). These days plenty of people are reticent to do business with a company that doesn&amp;#39;t have a website, since it seems a bit sketchy. &lt;em&gt;Who are they, really?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, registering your own domains and either creating sites or directing them to relevant existing properties is a good idea. (And yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/small-businesses-without-a-web-presence-are-missing-out.html&quot;&gt;many small businesses still don&amp;#39;t have a web presence&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Monitor, engage, and converse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping a close eye on your own online properties, it&amp;#39;s a good idea to set up social media, blog, and news alerts for those aforementioned terms (the ones your company uses and the ones others use) to enable good awareness and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On third party sites on which you participate, like social media, make sure that people are actively monitoring them if people choose those avenues to contact you. People will almost always try to contact you by the ways they&amp;#39;re familiar with, rather than whatever your company might prefer. If your audience or customer base is on Twitter, then you&amp;#39;d better be, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also be aware of how much you &amp;quot;broadcast&amp;quot;. That might seem odd, given I just recommended having policies for what, where, and how much you post. But note that Internet culture doesn&amp;#39;t tend to be a fan of companies having exclusively a &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot; attitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, people want it to be easy to get information and answers about you and your products. But that&amp;#39;s not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; they want from you. They also don&amp;#39;t want to be asked for things or told to do things that are clearly only going to benefit your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to be heard, and to be able to have a conversation with you (when &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want one), and know that their concerns are being listened to and that their problems get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to make your sites a really useful destination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So looking at your company&amp;#39;s own web properties, how should you handle those with respect to customer reviews and feedback? Well, ideally your company and its representatives don&amp;#39;t suck very often, and so people don&amp;#39;t have much reason to go looking for &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.sucks&lt;/em&gt; to vent their spleens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your company&amp;#39;s main website, be it &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.com&lt;/em&gt;, .BIZ, .IO, or other TLD variant, make sure it&amp;#39;s clear and easy for anyone to contact you. When someone is frustrated, not being able to find out how to get help or give feedback is only going to make people more upset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include plenty of links to your &lt;em&gt;help@yourcompany.com&lt;/em&gt; email address or contact form, a feedback button on every page, etc. Think of the places you go on sites to find that kind of information, and then make sure it&amp;#39;s there. (And in places where people look that wouldn&amp;#39;t have occurred to you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Be the master of your own domain(s)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable your company to have input and the ability to manage review-related sites about your company, you may want to register relevant domains yourself, before someone else does. This way you can manage what information is available there. Even if you think all your customers love you, it won&amp;#39;t hurt to register &lt;em&gt;yourcompanyreviews.com&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.reviews&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; or similar domains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to create websites for any or all of those. You could have the domains forward to your main website&amp;#39;s support section, customer forums, or other relevant location where people can give feedback, ask questions or express frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok to have fun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re really confident in your brand, customer service, culture, and customer base, you could approach things with a sense of humour (and bravery) and create a website at &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; where you actually welcome complaints. (And will also be including info about what you did about those complaints, e.g. linking to fixed issues, new features, etc.) Kind of like when celebrities read mean tweets or post hate mail on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do so, however, ensure that you have dedicated staff to monitor the site, respond, and who have enough agency to actually &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; people. If they&amp;#39;re going to go to &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; you need to make sure their next stop after that is &lt;em&gt;yourcompanyrocks.com&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this is a one-time project. Building a presence, reputation, and community online takes time, effort, and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Leaping into Singapore&#39;s startup scene</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jfdi.asia/&quot;&gt;JFDI&lt;/a&gt; is a Singapore business incubator and co-working space widely regarded as the most successful digital venture accelerator in Asia. Earlier this week, they had a fantastic demo day and by all accounts the event was hugely successful with a fresh crop of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jfdi.asia/2014/07/07/twelve-startups-wow-global-investors-at-2014a-demo-day/&quot;&gt;twelve start-ups&lt;/a&gt; taking to the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JFDI has an impressive track record and New Zealand founders have been ably represented in the recent past in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tradegecko.com/&quot;&gt;TradeGecko&lt;/a&gt;, which offers cloud hosted B2B inventory management software that provides greater transparency over stock control, purchasing and ordering for SMEs. The application integrates with other business services such as Xero, Vend and Shopify and includes a mobile CRM tool for busy sales staff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success stories like that show why building out a wider start-up ecosystem network across Asia-Pacific is important for leveraging economic growth in the region. Singapore is a natural focus point given its proximity to China and ASEAN, and with its stated goal of becoming a &amp;quot;smart nation&amp;quot; through highly connected population and infrastructure. So I&amp;#39;m really looking forward to visiting next week and finding out more about the Singaporean tech start-up scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is sponsoring &lt;a href=&quot;http://jfdi.asia/openhouse/&quot;&gt;JFDI&amp;#39;s open house&lt;/a&gt; on Friday 18th July at which there is always a warm invitation for creatives, geeks and entrepreneurs to attend and network. If you are a Singapore based customer of ours or want to find out more about what goes on at JFDI, please join us.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cities are a good bet for new domain extension success</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;new generic top-level (gTLDs) domain stats&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s clear that a number of the new domain extensions are merely flashes in the pan. Some, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.guru&lt;/a&gt; are doing well, but niche gTLDs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-archi&quot;&gt;.archi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-qpon&quot;&gt;.qpon&lt;/a&gt; and the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blackfriday&quot;&gt;.blackfriday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-christmas&quot;&gt;.christmas&lt;/a&gt; may need some time and luck to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one category makes a lot of sense for local residents and businesses, and also has a basis for success the other gTLDs don&amp;#39;t have—cities. Around the world (aside from the US), county-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are hugely popular, with .co.uk domain extension registrations in particular numbering well into the millions. And that sort of localized naming scheme seems to translate well to cities, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.Berlin&lt;/a&gt; currently sitting as the second most popular gTLD currently available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this month &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&quot;&gt;.Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; will become the second city gTLD, and with an estimated 30+ million people in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Tokyo_Area&quot;&gt;greater area&lt;/a&gt;, it has quite a bit of growth potential. Then we&amp;#39;ll see other big-city domains, including (but not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-amsterdam&quot;&gt;.Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-capetown&quot;&gt;.Capetown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dubai&quot;&gt;.Dubai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-moscow&quot;&gt;.Moscow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-paris&quot;&gt;.Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-quebec&quot;&gt;.Quebec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sydney&quot;&gt;.Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas&quot;&gt;.Vegas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look back at the launch of the gTLDs, I have a feeling the first big push away from .com (aside from the ccTLDs) will come in the form of these city extensions. They&amp;#39;re broad, yet specific, and are extremely memorable for their target audiences—the perfect combination for domain name success. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A new generic top-level domain hits 250,000 registrations</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some perspective. In order for the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to become mainstream, there needs to be a rapid rise in popularity. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;1.4 million total registrations&lt;/a&gt; is a nice start (the new gTLD are only a few months old), but .com has 100 million domains under its umbrella. It&amp;#39;s so big, in fact, that .com is synonymous with the internet for much of the world—but it may not always be that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&quot;&gt;.Xyz&lt;/a&gt;, billed as the natural ending for everything (because it&amp;#39;s the end of the alphabet), has hit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld/xyz&quot;&gt;250,000 domains registered mark&lt;/a&gt;, now making up nearly 18% of all the new gTLDs in existance. There have been some pretty egregious instances of stat manipulation, but looking at the bigger picture, the rise of .xyz (and the fact that people are talking about it) makes it seem possible for a number of these gTLDs to catch on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New gTLDs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.app&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&quot;&gt;.blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-web&quot;&gt;.web&lt;/a&gt; are surefire hits that haven&amp;#39;t come out yet, and the growing popularity of city gTLDs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&quot;&gt;.tokyo&lt;/a&gt; are hopefully indicators of upcoming successes. The dream of seeing new gTLDs on billboards and ads and shows is still very much alive, it&amp;#39;s just going to take some time—and .xyz&amp;#39;s 250,000 is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the new domain extensions of July, including .tokyo, .media and .town</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New generic top-level domains (gTLDs) have been coming out at a rapid pace the last few months, and now there are nearly 1.4 million registered gTLDs in existance (up from less than a million on June 1). Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt; most popular, it&amp;#39;s still apparent that the average gTLD is still fairly small (#30 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-training&quot;&gt;.training&lt;/a&gt; only has around 9,000 registrations), but the top of the list has grown dramatically. Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&quot;&gt;.xyz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; have more than 100,000 registered domains, and previous leaders &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.guru&lt;/a&gt; have more than 60,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we&amp;#39;ll see a new favorite from the new July domains though. Maybe .tokyo will go on to rival .berlin. Or maybe .blackfriday (??) will capture the hearts of retailers looking to cash in on the big day. Check out the launch calendar for July and find your favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ultimate guide to Google Analytics (it covers everything)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things people tend to do as soon as they set up websites is install some kind of analytics platform. Some people choose paid platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://clicky.com/&quot;&gt;Clicky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gosquared.com/&quot;&gt;GoSquared&lt;/a&gt;, but most choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/analytics/&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, the completely free platform that does just about everything you could ever want an analytics platform to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there lies the problem—what the heck are people supposed to do with analytics? Sure, it&amp;#39;s fun to see what parts of the world users are coming from and what pages are being read more than others, but the amount of data you can gather from Google Analytics is astounding. If you know what you&amp;#39;re doing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kaitlin Ziessler, introducing her article titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://builtvisible.com/google-analytics-resource-guide/?utm_content=bufferaf916&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot;&gt;Google Analytics Resource Guide of Epic Proportions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is meant to educate and be a resource for people on a range of GA topics from types of tracking to what exactly is being calculated to even cover some common issues seen recently. So either start at the top and read the whole post or click on a specific topic and just read that section if you prefer. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As advertised, it&amp;#39;s a resource of epic proportions. It goes over types of tracking, what Google Analytics tracks, how you can improve your data gathering, frequent issues and a number of resources and tools you can use to get everything you can out of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite impressive, and if you&amp;#39;re a Google Analytics user (or plan on being one soon), you really should take the time to dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gmail supporting non-Latin domains by the end of the month</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalbydesign.com/2014/06/26/gmail-non-latin-email-addresses/&quot;&gt;From John Yunker - Global by Design:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ICANN 50 conference Jordyn Buchanan of Google confirmed that Gmail would support EAI (email address internationalization) by the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the details yet, but at a minimum I assume it means a Gmail user could create an email address using a non-Latin label, such as [RussianName]@gmail.com. And this address would work with others on the Gmail platform, though not other email platforms. And this is not because Google doesn’t want to work with other platforms, but because there are so many mail servers involved in successfully delivering email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But assuming that this is full EAI support, then the user could also use a complete non-Latin email address, such as [RussianName]@[RussianDomain].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has changed quite a bit with the launch of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, and buried amongst all the news of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&quot;&gt;.xyz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt; is the success of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese TLD for &amp;#39;online&amp;#39;. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://namestat.org/&quot;&gt;more than 33,000 domains registered&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s the seventh most popular extension currently available—and that&amp;#39;s without the ability to be widely used for email, one of the most essential tools of the modern web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all changing though, and at the end of the month we&amp;#39;ll be seeing Gmail (and likely &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; email addresses as well, or soon after) in an assortment of languages. And making the internet more accessible for everyone is certainly a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ICANN email checks have knocked out a million websites—don&#39;t let yours be next</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in January we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html&quot;&gt;wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; informing everyone of ICANN&amp;#39;s new rules for verifying contact information. To recap, &amp;quot;When you register a domain with new contact details, transfer existing domains or change the registrant (owner) or email address on your contact information, you will receive an additional email with an activation link. &lt;strong&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t press this link, your domain will be disabled after 15 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a domain registrar, rules like these are quite scary because we&amp;#39;re the point of contact when things go wrong, and there&amp;#39;s really nothing we can do to fix an ICANN-suspended domain other than point customers to their verification error landing pages. Our hope was that the process would go smoothly for our customers (and thankfully we haven&amp;#39;t had too many issues), but it seems to be a pretty big issue for the internet at large. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kevin Murphy - &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/16963-a-million-domains-taken-down-by-email-checks?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DomainIncite+%28DomainIncite.com%29&quot;&gt;Domain Incite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 800,000 domain names have been suspended since the beginning of the year as a result of Whois email verification rules in the new ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to the Registrars Stakeholder Group, which collected suspension data from registrars representing about 75% of all registered gTLD domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual number of suspended domains could be closer to a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just for the sake of being safe, I&amp;#39;ll end this post the same way we ended our original post on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what should you do now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you are able, please ensure that your domain name is associated with a valid email address. The last thing we want is for you to make a change, then have your verification email sent to an old address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you purchase a domain or make a change after January 2014 and don&amp;#39;t receive an email, or if you just have questions about the new ICANN rules, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Squarespace + iwantmyname makes website building a snap</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ve come up with a plan to create a fully functional website with a blog, plenty of useful content and maybe even an online store. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;Getting a domain&lt;/a&gt; is easy (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt2.html&quot;&gt;selecting a domain name&lt;/a&gt; may take some thought), but actually building your site without coding knowledge or a freelance budget can be a real challenge. Unless you&amp;#39;re using Squarespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, even writers like myself can take one of the many professional &lt;a href=&quot;https://squarespace.com/templates/&quot;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; provided and tweak it to become something that&amp;#39;s completely original—all without needing to deal with hosting space and servers like you would with Wordpress.org. You can easily edit things like colors, fonts (from Google and Typekit) and sizes using simple sliders, you can integrate blogs and photo galleries to any page, and third-party integrations like Amazon products, Instagram feeds and Soundcloud files are just a few clicks away. And if you&amp;#39;re really on a shoestring budget, you can even use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/need-a-logo-squarespace-has-you-covered.html&quot;&gt;Squarespace Logos&lt;/a&gt; to craft a logo with some nice fonts and simple designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-06-24-squarespace-products.png&quot; alt=&quot;Products&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many users though, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/tour/shops&quot;&gt;Commerce&lt;/a&gt; features are the main draw. Using a the same simple integration tools you use to add third-party integrations, you can add products to your site, manage your inventory, take payments and customize marketing emails. It really is a one-stop-shop for all your ecommerce needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your domain with Squarespace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re ready to build your Squarespace site, adding your domain is super simple. First, head over to your iwantmyname dashboard and select &lt;strong&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Services&lt;/strong&gt; under the &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; menu. Then, under the &lt;strong&gt;Website Builder&lt;/strong&gt; category, click on Squarespace (or just type in Squarespace in the search field). Now, just add it to your domain and click &lt;strong&gt;Install Squarespace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-06-24-squarespace-iwantmyname.png&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace install&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re done with the iwantmyname side, just login to your Squarespace account (or sign up for one) and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; icon. In that menu, you&amp;#39;ll see a &lt;strong&gt;Domains&lt;/strong&gt; option, which will show a &lt;strong&gt;Link Existing&lt;/strong&gt; button in the top-right corner. From there, just type in your domain and you&amp;#39;re all set up (if you need help on the Squarespace side, their &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;tech support&lt;/a&gt; is quite responsive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it! You&amp;#39;re now ready to build a website for all the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A quick note about separating your domain from your hosting platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had many customers ask us about Squarespace&amp;#39;s offer for a free domain when you pre-pay for a full year of their service. It&amp;#39;s a great deal from a cost standpoint, but there are some major drawbacks to keep in mind: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The free Squarespace domains are limited to .com, .net, .org, .info, .mobi and .biz, which means you can&amp;#39;t use a ccTLD like .uk or .io or a new gTLD like .club or .photography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ll lose all the one-click install features iwantmyname offers for adding things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;custom email addresses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/&quot;&gt;URL shortening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As long as you&amp;#39;re a Squarespace customer paying by the year you&amp;#39;re fine, but if you downgrade your account or want to change platforms altogether, you&amp;#39;ll have to transfer your domains fairly quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to create a companion site for a one-off campaign, you&amp;#39;ll have to register that domain somewhere else (meaning you&amp;#39;ll have two registrars to manage). As of now, Squarespace only lets you host one domain at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Say hi to the 10th iwantmynamer, Travis Holton</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a sustainable company is a victory in and of itself, but growth is always cause for celebration. And today, we&amp;#39;re celebrating the 10th member of the iwantmyname team—Travis Holton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis comes to New Zealand by way of the US and Germany (where he spent some time working with Lenz and Manu in Starnberg), and brings with him a host of software development experience. He specializes in Object Oriented Design, Python, Perl and JavaScript, but has worked with and can adapt to anything we&amp;#39;ll be throwing at him. He also has half-a-decade of experience in the domain industry, so his blend of prior knowledge and current skills will be incredibly useful for our future growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more important than his programming skills are the extra things he brings to the table. He&amp;#39;s a home-brewer (every office needs a home-brewer), he lives on a farm near a beach (perfect for company outings) and his wife makes the most amazing goat cheeses and coffee/tea creamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you get the chance, be sure to welcome Travis to the team (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/heytrav&quot;&gt;@heytrav&lt;/a&gt;). We&amp;#39;re really happy to have him on board, and are thrilled to round the team out to an even 10. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Yes, you can still get free custom email addresses</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when you could easily get free custom email addresses through Google, but those days have come and gone. Now if you want to set up a name@yourdomain.tld email address, you have to pay up like you&amp;#39;re a business. Multiple users, vast amounts of space, tons of add-ons. But if you&amp;#39;re just looking for something small that may or may not ever grow, having a freemium option is ideal. And for that, you should check out Zoho Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Zoho Mail offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing2.html&quot;&gt;just about everything&lt;/a&gt; gmail does, including lots of space, document storage and integration with productivity tools like calendars and task lists. Zoho Mail also has a webmail interface that works surprisingly well, and can easily be added to your favorite mail app for a more personalized workflow. Best of all though is the aforementioned free tier, with 5GB mail and document storage for up to 10 users (and it&amp;#39;s ad-free).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-06-19-zoho-tiers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tiers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your custom email address&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re ready to get started with Zoho Mail, the setup is quite simple. First, head to your iwantmyname dashboard and select &lt;strong&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Services&lt;/strong&gt; under the &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; menu. Under the &lt;strong&gt;Mail&lt;/strong&gt; category, you&amp;#39;ll see &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite&quot;&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt; (or just type in Zoho Mail in the search field). From there, just add it to your domain and click &lt;strong&gt;Install Zoho Mail&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the domain is set up, head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing.html&quot;&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, after you type in all the information needed, you&amp;#39;re on to verifying ownership of your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-06-19-zoho-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zoho Domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the screenshot below, just select &lt;strong&gt;TXT Method&lt;/strong&gt; and click &lt;strong&gt;Verify&lt;/strong&gt;. Since you already have your domain configured, everything should go through without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-06-19-zoho-verify.png&quot; alt=&quot;Verify&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it! You now have your very own custom email address (it may take a while to start working, so hang tight if it&amp;#39;s not instant). And as always, if you have any questions about the install, just let us know via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>8 alternatives to .com for review websites</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re creating a review website, but like so many before you, finding a good .com that fits your brand name is nearly impossible. It&amp;#39;s a difficult dilemma, because the last thing you want is to cripple your brand with a top-level domain that might come across as less than professional. But with hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out over the next few years, in addition to the list of country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) already available, people are naturally going to become more and more used to seeing things other than .com at the end of their favorite domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;re ready to make the leap, here are some TLDs you should keep your eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert&quot;&gt;.expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.guru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to be an authority in your field, you&amp;#39;d better be an expert. And with the .expert and .guru TLDs, your expert status will be set in stone. Also, a big side benefit is that both of these TLDs have already established a level of popularity, with nearly 100,000 domains registered between them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-review&quot;&gt;.review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-reviews&quot;&gt;.reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a believer in the new gTLDs truly categorizing the internet, no TLDs are more fitting for review sites than .review and .reviews. The real question is which one to go with. The common thought is that you should always try to get your domain name to be as short as possible, but it&amp;#39;s seems more natural to say .reviews when looking for reviews of something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-search&quot;&gt;.search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review sites are incredibly useful for determining the quality of things, but sometimes all people want is a good place to find what&amp;#39;s new. They&amp;#39;re just searching, and the .search gTLD captures that perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your local ccTLD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Americans, it&amp;#39;s fairly uncommon to see local ccTLDs for websites, but most countries around the world use their country&amp;#39;s domain extension for local businesses and blogs—like Spain with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.es&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.uk&lt;/a&gt; with the UK and Italy with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&quot;&gt;.it&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously this wouldn&amp;#39;t be the best solution for a review site looking for an international reach, but local restaurant reviews and the like would be served well by staying local. And America... is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us-american-domain-name-registration-for-usa&quot;&gt;.us&lt;/a&gt; TLD so bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for your specific topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than a hundred gTLDs currently available, and hundreds more coming out soon, there are endless possibilities for great review site domain names. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&quot;&gt;.Beer&lt;/a&gt; would be amazing for a beer review site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cars&quot;&gt;.cars&lt;/a&gt; would go so well for a car blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tech&quot;&gt;.tech&lt;/a&gt; for a tech review site, and the list goes on and on. The only thing to keep in mind when narrowing your reach is that it&amp;#39;s hard to expand later. For example, it would be pretty odd to make a site ending in .beer transition to wine reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How do I find out if the domain I want becomes available?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not comfortable contacting the domain owner directly, or you tried and didn&amp;#39;t get a response, you can attempt to procure the domain when it expires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is anything but a guaranteed strategy, however. Most registrars remind their customers early and often prior to domains expiring. Most registrars also auto-renew domains by default as long as the customer&amp;#39;s payment details are accurate and up to date. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184422&quot;&gt;iwantmyname does both of these things for their customers.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a domain&amp;#39;s ownership does expire, many registrars give their customers a grace period after expiration so they can still renew it, sometimes at a considerably increased cost. (This pricing is set by the registries, not registrars like iwantmyname.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also try a domain monitoring service, which alerts you to status changes and expirations for your own domains, or others that are of interest to you. Be aware though that this offering can be an upsell attempt by some registrars. (iwantmyname does not offer this service.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backordering services are also popular, and if you want a maximum chance of getting the domain if/when it expires, we recommend using all of them. Most of these services will only charge you if they manage to procure the domain, but some charge in advance. Here are a few popular options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://namejet.com&quot;&gt;NameJet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://snapnames.com&quot;&gt;SnapNames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://backorderzone.com&quot;&gt;BackorderZone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pool.com&quot;&gt;Pool.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can you make an offer for a domain name for me?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service is called brokerage, and iwantmyname does not offer any domain brokerage services. We recommend contacting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sedo.com/us/buy-domains/domain-brokerage/&quot;&gt;Sedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainagents.com/&quot;&gt;DomainAgents&lt;/a&gt; to assist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brokers will do is contact the domain owner (if they can), then make an offer for the domain for you, handle negotiations, and finalize the agreement to purchase and transfer the domain. You will pay the broker a fee in addition to whatever price you pay for the domain name itself.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Someone has registered a domain with my trademark. What do I do?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to follow the instructions outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp&quot;&gt;ICANN&amp;#39;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy&lt;/a&gt; (UDRP). Consulting a lawyer may also be useful in ensuring your case is as strong as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that even though you own the trademark, a domain squatter will still likely fight to keep the domain, since it was purchased in the first place to make money. Getting the domain name may be expensive, but if you own the trademark (or are a celebrity), you have a good chance of getting the domain from the squatter. Really, it comes down to whether it&amp;#39;s worth the trouble to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can I buy the domain I want from the owner?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly. Certainly you can contact the person or company and see if they&amp;#39;re interested in selling it. Be aware that the person who owns the domain is under no obligation to sell it, may want a lot more money for it than you&amp;#39;re willing or able to pay, and may not be very interested in negotiating the price. Best to start off asking casually and generally if the owner would be interested in selling, don&amp;#39;t share too much about who you are and why you want the domain, and be very polite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an interested buyer, really your only leverage is how much you&amp;#39;re willing or able to spend, and your ability to walk away if you can&amp;#39;t come to agreeable terms. It&amp;#39;s always a good idea to have other options available to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;#39;t order business cards or marketing collateral with a specific domain name on them if you don&amp;#39;t absolutely positively own the domain already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do I find out who owns the domain I want?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out who owns a domain, try a &lt;a href=&quot;http://whois.domaintools.com/&quot;&gt;WHOIS lookup&lt;/a&gt;. Typically the contact information of the person who owns the domain will appear on the search results page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if they are using a privacy service, there should still be an email address you can use to contact the owner, or at least a domain holding company. If a domain is held by a company wanting to make money on selling domains, they&amp;#39;re probably going to make it easy to get a hold of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How much is the domain I want worth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That depends on a lot of factors. There is no service you can check to see what a given domain should be worth. Any site that claims to tell you what your domain name or social media account is worth is just using some arbitrary calculation. They are just for fun and have no legal use or bearing on actual domain value or prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any domain is worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it (assuming the owner is interested in selling at all). Note that some domain owners have pretty grandiose ideas about what their domain is worth, or think they can get rich quick off some desperate buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things that can influence the cost of a domain name. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the word(s) in the name are simple, clear and common, including standard spellings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the word(s) is a recognizable person, company, product, etc. (i.e. don&amp;#39;t expect to get &amp;quot;coke.com&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the domain is already in use (as noted, there&amp;#39;s a website, email addresses, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the domain name is related to something that may become important in the future, e.g. an event, new product, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how badly the owner can tell that you want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how badly the owner needs or wants the money &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much you appear to be willing or able to pay for it (e.g. there&amp;#39;s a good chance that the price may be higher if a company wants a domain than if just an individual person does) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legal status of the domain (e.g. is it a registered trademark)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the state of the industry or economy (e.g. during a tech bubble, like many things, domain name prices may become inflated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>What is domain squatting/cybersquatting?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain squatting (occasionally still called cybersquatting) typically happens for one of two reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner could be holding the domain for a period of time to build up interest, then offer it for public sale in hopes of a bidding war. The owner could also be squatting to profit from the domain more immediately. This could be done by running a bunch of ads on a parking page, by offering the domain for rent to another entity (so you could use the domain and put up a site, but wouldn&amp;#39;t own it), or by attempting to quickly sell the domain for much more than was paid for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another domain squatting tactic is to buy expired domain names in the hopes that the owners let them expire by accident and will want them back, and are willing to pay a premium for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain squatting can also be done accidentally by someone with good intentions, e.g. a big fan of a particular celebrity, character or sports team. That person could register the domain, e.g. &amp;quot;batman.com&amp;quot; and set up a fan site dedicated to all things Batman. But that site isn&amp;#39;t actually owned by DC Comics, who own the rights to the Batman character. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the person who set up the site might just be a huge Batman fan, but the person could also be hoping that DC will offer them a lot of money for the domain to avoid legal wrangling (though in this case the squatter doesn&amp;#39;t have much of a case). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, resolving domain squatting requires determining several things. Is the domain name part of someone&amp;#39;s trademark? Is the domain name part of a well-known brand, even if not trademarked? (Like a celebrity&amp;#39;s identity, e.g. it&amp;#39;s unlikely anyone&amp;#39;s going to assume &amp;quot;georgeclooney.com&amp;quot; is about anyone other than the actor.) Was the person who bought the domain acting in &amp;quot;good faith&amp;quot; (e.g. big fan) or &amp;quot;bad faith&amp;quot; (i.e. hoping to profit from identity assumptions or sale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad faith domain squatting is illegal, but can still be expensive to resolve by legal channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the difference between domain speculation and squatting?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no single, definitive (i.e. legally binding) definition, but generally squatting implies &amp;quot;bad faith&amp;quot; intent on the part of the person or company that has registered the domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that they have no interest in or intentions of creating a website for the domain or otherwise using it (like it becoming the main web presence for their business). That person just bought it to sell it for more than they paid for it (ideally much more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often squatters will intentionally target a company, product or prominent person in registering domain names. By doing this, squatters are gambling that the company or person targeted will just pay what the squatter wants to avoid expensive legal proceedings and the risk of being denied the rights to that domain name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a registrant might register &amp;quot;thisismycompany.ca&amp;quot; in hopes that the company, which is based in New Zealand, for example, would start doing a lot of business in Canada and want to buy that domain. Or if a company was launching a new product called SuperNamer, and a registrant who didn&amp;#39;t represent the company registered &amp;quot;supernamer.com&amp;quot; specifically to try and make the company pay them to get that domain so they could launch their new product with the most recognizable domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain speculation, on the other hand, involves registering domains that might be useful or of interest, but which don&amp;#39;t block an existing trademark or brand. For example, instead of registering a variant of an existing company&amp;#39;s domain, registering something more general, like &amp;quot;weselldomains.com&amp;quot; in hopes that some domain registrar might want it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculators are often more open about the fact that the domains in their portfolio are for sale, as well. Whereas squatters might set up a basic page to make it marginally look like the domain is in use. Or create a parking page full of ads to try and get click traffic for extra revenue until they can sell the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some squatters own many domains, though some will only target a few, since the more domains you own that haven&amp;#39;t sold yet, the more money you&amp;#39;ve invested without return. Speculators often own a large portfolio of domains, targeting various industries with a selection of relevant terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain squatting, if a person&amp;#39;s or company&amp;#39;s actions are deemed to be that, is illegal. Some countries have specific laws against squatting that are more specific than standard trademark law. However, since the internet is a global entity, issues of jurisdiction can arise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disputes are generally resolved using ICANN&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp&quot;&gt;Uniform Domain Name Resolution Policy (UDRP)&lt;/a&gt;. There has been some criticism that UDRP favours large corporations in its rulings. Some domain name disputes are also resolved in court via lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why it&#39;s important to have you own domain and web presence</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having your own domain name, even if it&amp;#39;s not perfect, is far more important than building your online presence on top of another service&amp;#39;s URL, e.g. yourshop.shopify.com or facebook.com/yourcompany. This practice of building your brand, service or web presence on another organization&amp;#39;s platform is an example of &amp;quot;sharecropping&amp;quot;. It can be problematic for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other platform you&amp;#39;re hosted on controls how your presence can look or function (e.g. templates and tiered feature offerings depending on how much you pay). The other platform can change services or raise rates, leaving you little recourse since not accepting/paying could mean losing your site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other platform can control how much exposure you get. There&amp;#39;ve been lots of articles about issues with brands on Facebook getting ever-lessening exposure of their content to their fans if they don&amp;#39;t pay for advertising. The other platform can limit your access to analytics, making it hard to know how large your audience actually is, what they&amp;#39;re doing on your site, or where they&amp;#39;re engaging when they&amp;#39;re there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the other platform could simply take your site offline without much notice, explanation or recourse if you are deemed to have violated terms of service or other issues. It can take a lot of time and frustration to get these issues sorted out, and all the while your site is unavailable to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always switch domains later, but start with a web address you can control and build up your search engine visibility. A very specific domain name is less important than it was 10 years ago because more people use search engines or recommendations from friends via social sites like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If someone isn&amp;#39;t using the domain I want, can I have it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Well, not without the owner agreeing to transfer it to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a domain is registered to someone else, they have paid for it and own it. Having an active website is not required to own a domain. As long as the person pays to renew ownership, no one else can have the domain, even if they don&amp;#39;t appear to be using it, unless that person agrees to transfer or sell the domain, or lets it expire. (Or, in some cases, if their ownership or usage of the domain violates someone else&amp;#39;s trademark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking a registrar to take a domain for you won&amp;#39;t work, either. We have no more legal right to remove it from the owner than you do, and this applies globally, not just in a specific country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it in reverse: if someone else decided they wanted &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; domain, would you be okay with us just taking it from you and giving it to them, regardless of what you were doing with it?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How do I pick a domain that people will remember?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html&quot;&gt;the previous part of this post series&lt;/a&gt;, you can look for a variant of &amp;quot;theperfectdomain&amp;quot;. But be aware of potential confusion if the domain extension (e.g. .NET / .GURU / .CA) is the only difference between your domain and someone else&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try small changes to the domain name you want. Like adding or dropping an article. Instead of &amp;quot;companyname&amp;quot;, use &amp;quot;thecompanyname&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;getproductname&amp;quot;. Again, there is still a good chance people will get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of directly referring to your company, group, or topic name, you could focus on something relevant and important, like what the product or service enables you to do. A photographer could register a domain using &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;snap&amp;quot;, or referencing &amp;quot;memories&amp;quot;. A group of pilots could use &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;wings&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;soar&amp;quot;. Using slang or terminology common among your group could make for a memorable domain name as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could use one of the new gTLDs to hack the domain and create an interesting and relevant phrase. For example, if you had wanted to register &amp;quot;bobsphotos.com&amp;quot;, but it was taken, instead you could register &amp;quot;bobs.photos&amp;quot;. Or &amp;quot;mydoma.in&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425500&quot;&gt;Read more about domain hacking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is where you or your organization is located geographically. Should you go local with your identity, or embrace the international nature of the Internet? Should you use a gTLD or a ccTLD? ccTLDs are country code top-level domains, and are all two-letter domain extentions representing countries or regions, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;.FR&lt;/a&gt; for France or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; for Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use a ccTLD to represent yourself or organization geographically, being proudly Canadian (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt;) or Belgian (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium&quot;&gt;.BE&lt;/a&gt;) or Japanese (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/jp-japanese-domain-name-registration-for-japan&quot;&gt;.JP&lt;/a&gt;). Or you can use a ccTLD for one of the aforementioned domain hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google now treats 20 ccTLDs as generic, i.e. like they were among the hundreds of three-letters-or-longer gTLDs. Familiar ones include .CO, .ME and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.TV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedomains.com/2013/05/02/the-20-cctlds-that-google-treats-as-generic-tlds/&quot;&gt;Here is the current full list.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do I get my domain/site to rank better in search results?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you want to do is improve your site&amp;#39;s Search Engine Optimization (SEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re registering a domain name similar to an existing site that has the domain name you wanted, be aware that the other site has been online longer and become more established. It will take a while and some effort before your site could rank well (and possibly better) in search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way it works is that search engines like Google use an algorithm to determine how websites should rank for any given search term. For example, if you search for a company name (e.g. one used in that domain name), Google looks at all the pages on the Internet that are the most relevant relating to that name. That could include websites, news articles, blogs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a site becomes more active, develops more content, and gets more engagement (i.e. people visiting, sharing links to its articles, etc.) it becomes more currently relevant. The odds that that information is what a searcher is looking for increase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the search ranking starts to change. Given a bit of time, the site could even start to show up on searches that don&amp;#39;t involve the name, but for topics and terms it covers well. &lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo&quot;&gt;Read more about Search Engine Optimization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to note that Google&amp;#39;s systems are very smart, and are continually improved to guard against scams and gaming the system. Stuffing content with keywords relevant to your site or creating links to your site&amp;#39;s content all over the Internet won&amp;#39;t work to improve your search rankings, because Google&amp;#39;s algorithms are very good at distinguishing &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; links and references from scammy ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Someone has registered the domain I want. Help!</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve started a business, a club or a blog. You&amp;#39;ve got plenty of work ahead of you, and you&amp;#39;re excited about it. Your idea is fantastic, you&amp;#39;ve got so much you want to share with the world, and most importantly, you&amp;#39;ve picked out a fantastic name. It&amp;#39;s clever, descriptive and easy to remember. Now to register the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get The Perfect Domain can be really frustrating. Or, at the very least, really expensive. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/24/after-losing-over-25000-registrations-in-two-days-com-back-below-113-million-berlin-top-40k/&quot;&gt;Well over 100 million .COM domains are currently registered.&lt;/a&gt; Which means  that &amp;quot;the good ones&amp;quot; are probably taken. Estimates are that the total number of registered domains topped a quarter of a &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; last year. (Estimates are that nearly half consist of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, there doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be an associated website for a domain name to be registered and unavailable to you. What&amp;#39;s a person to do in the quest to register the perfect domain name? Well, there are a few options, which we&amp;#39;ll break down for you in this series on what to do if the domain you want is already registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How can I tell if a domain name I want is registered already?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can enter the domain you&amp;#39;re interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; and see which variants are available. Available domains will show a green smiley face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Just because a website doesn&amp;#39;t come up when you enter the domain name into a browser doesn&amp;#39;t mean it hasn&amp;#39;t already been registered. Some registrars use parking pages or display ads on unused-but-registered domains, but not all (iwantmyname doesn&amp;#39;t). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a domain name is not showing as available, and you can&amp;#39;t find a website for it, some reasons might be that the owner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is working on a site that&amp;#39;s not launched yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is only using the domain for email addresses (e.g. hello@theperfectdomain.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is keeping it because the name is similar to a domain he/she is actively using and the domain is being redirected to their site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has an idea for the future and registered the domain in advance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is just really fond of the name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wants to prevent other entities from using his/her name or brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can I register a similar domain name?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, if &amp;quot;theperfectdomain.com&amp;quot; is already registered, you could always just register the same domain name with a different extension, e.g. &amp;quot;theperfectdomain.info&amp;quot;. The biggest potential problem there is people forgetting that your domain extension isn&amp;#39;t .COM and going to the other site looking for you and getting confused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are slowly but surely embracing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;the new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;. gTLDs are generic top-level domains, which is the part after the dot, e.g. &amp;quot;.com&amp;quot; - the gTLD is &amp;quot;COM&amp;quot;. Hundreds of new gTLDs are being released, ranging from city names (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.LONDON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;) to hobbies and professions (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-accountants&quot;&gt;.ACCOUNTANTS&lt;/a&gt;) to surnames (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kim&quot;&gt;.KIM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wang&quot;&gt;.WANG&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it will take time for people to get used to this new world where anything is .POSSIBLE. (Note: .POSSIBLE is not actually one of the new gTLDs, though it should be.) So, what is an enterprising individual or company to do? Well, there are a few options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are getting more creative with their naming, turning to domain naming options like &amp;quot;getourproduct.com&amp;quot; instead of the specific company name, or registering &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; domains in lieu of the elusive .COM.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Simple tips for picking out the perfect domain name</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through a little exercise yesterday while trying to find a great domain name for a side project. Nothing too scientific, but the whole process reminded me of how hard it is to settle on a single domain for a brand. Do you go with relevant keywords? Throw caution to the wind and select something obscure? Use a new generic top-level domain (gTLD)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, let&amp;#39;s go through the naming process for an imaginary tech review blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, it&amp;#39;s always good to put down the obvious. And here, the obvious choice is to use some combination of the words &amp;quot;tech&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;reviews.&amp;quot; Common phrases come with ferocious competition though, and a quick search for &amp;quot;techreview&amp;quot; proves that by eliminating popular TLDs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.co&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.org&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt;. But there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a number of great TLDs available, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert&quot;&gt;.expert&lt;/a&gt; (techreview.expert) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io&lt;/a&gt; (techreview.io). Do some research though on the other sites with the same name to make sure you&amp;#39;re not competing against someone doing the same exact thing. You don&amp;#39;t want that sort of competition in your life, and you certainly don&amp;#39;t want to be thought of as a copycat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking simplicity one step further, you can also just search for root words, like &amp;quot;tech.&amp;quot; That particular word turned out to be a dud here (unless you&amp;#39;re specifically targeting tech for cruises or futbol), but it never hurts to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to look for related terms, like &amp;quot;wire&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;electronic.&amp;quot; Think of similar sites like thewirecutter.com, engadget.com and wired.com, then run through a list of 10-20 words (or more) and mix and match and jumble phrases until you get something you like. A lot of people will also tell you to stick with a .com here, but I think that&amp;#39;s a conservative way to look at naming. There&amp;#39;s a whole world of relevant TLDs that can be combined with short words to create concise, memorable domains, and you&amp;#39;d be severely limited by not considering one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of thewirecutter.com, using &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; in front of a name can be a good way to show importance (not just one of the best, you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best), but know that you&amp;#39;re always going to have people confused as to whether the &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; is in the domain or not. In this case, The Wirecutter uses thewirecutter.com as their primary domain, but also uses wirecutter.com as a secondary forward, just to eliminate confusion. If you decide to go with a &amp;quot;the,&amp;quot; you really should protect yourself by having both domains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing to look for when dealing with generic phrases are possible &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt;. After the launch of the new gTLDs, domains hacks fell a bit out of favor, but if you think you can pull one off, go for it. For the uninitiated, a domain hack is a domain that uses the TLD as part of a word. For example, instead of naming a site about Trekkies, trekkies.com, you could name it trekki.es. So instead of using .com, you end the natural word with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.es&lt;/a&gt; country code TLD (ccTLD)) at the end. Domain hacks are clever, but beware the verbalization problem. It&amp;#39;s easy to tell someone a name ending with .com or .expert, but verbalizing &amp;quot;trekki (that&amp;#39;s two k&amp;#39;s and ends with an I) dot e s&amp;quot; could be unnecessarily complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So once you&amp;#39;ve exhausted the all the generic phrases, relevant keyword jumbles and domain hacks you can think of, my suggestion is to come up with some words or phrases that sum up yourself or your product. Think daringfireball.com, John Gruber&amp;#39;s blog that rifles off educated opinions like a daring fireball... or something like that. Or perhaps theverge.com, covering &amp;quot;the culture of now.&amp;quot; The phrase &amp;quot;daring fireball&amp;quot; especially has little to do with its subject matter, but John Gruber&amp;#39;s continued dedication to his blog has made it a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings me to the most important tip of all. At the end of the day, what&amp;#39;s important is not your domain name, it&amp;#39;s the content that lives on it. If it&amp;#39;s good enough for long enough, it&amp;#39;ll get read no matter what your domain is. If it&amp;#39;s not, it won&amp;#39;t. Just take the time to find a name you&amp;#39;re happy with that doesn&amp;#39;t paint you into a corner (i.e., don&amp;#39;t limit yourself to a domain with the word iPhone if you might eventually review Android phones) and go with it. Every idea is a good idea once you make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Drop the .co from your .co.uk domains—get yourname.uk starting June 10th</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/uk-domains-without-the-co-coming-summer-2014.html&quot;&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, second-level .UK domains will launch on June 10, 2014. This will allow you to register names such as yourname.uk or yourbusiness.uk instead of having to use the .CO.UK suffix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware though that the .UK registry, Nominet, is making things a bit tricky for domain owners. We&amp;#39;ve learned that second-level .UK domains can only be registered if the domain owner or an administrative contact has a valid address in the United Kingdom, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man (and the use of a PO Box is not allowed). Nominet has also been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/about-domain-names/domain-lookup-whois/data-validation-status&quot;&gt;checking domains for valid contact details&lt;/a&gt;, so know that they&amp;#39;ll disable and delete domains if your contact information cannot be validated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, owners of .CO.UK domains will have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dotuklaunch.co.uk/im-existing-customer&quot;&gt;priority access to their corresponding .UK domains&lt;/a&gt; for five years. Because of this, many domains that are technically free will not appear in our site search, but if you are the current owner of a .CO.UK at iwantmyname and want your .UK too, please get in touch after June 10th and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we can help you out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Lightning strikes twice in Wellington&#39;s startup scene</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has already been a very busy year at iwantmyname, and once again we&amp;#39;re right back into supporting local events and communities here in New Zealand. This year, Lenz and I took up an invitation to be mentors at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lightninglab.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Lightning Lab&lt;/a&gt;, a web venture accelerator that promotes lean methodologies and has attracted angel investment from far and wide. Lightning Lab takes very early stage web start-ups and puts them through a TechStars style programme that challenges founders to break down and reconstruct every aspect of their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second year running &lt;a href=&quot;http://demoday.lightninglab.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Lightning Lab Demo Day&lt;/a&gt; presented ventures that stayed the course, putting their best feet forward with a pitch to a large group of potential angel investors and with the support of the wider tech start-up community. Showcase projects ranged across the spectrum. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coachseek.com/&quot;&gt;CoachSeek&lt;/a&gt; is an application that handles the administrative burden for sports coaches and has already signed 300 customers worldwide. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.cogodigital.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Cogo&lt;/a&gt; is an online knowledge management tool for small and medium sized businesses. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mish.guru/&quot;&gt;MishGuru&lt;/a&gt; grabbed a cool new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt; domain off us and bravely rebuilt their proposal from the ground up, reconfiguring as an overlay that helps businesses leverage popular social media service SnapChat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twin.gl/&quot;&gt;Twingl&lt;/a&gt; was a project that formed at a recent Startup Weekend event and we&amp;#39;ve been following the team with interest ever since. Their stated goal is to contribute to the evolution of human intelligence by improving the way we manage multiple sources of information in the browser. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudcannon.com/&quot;&gt;CloudCannon&lt;/a&gt; helps designers more easily deploy, host and maintain fully self-managed websites. In fact, we liked Cloud Cannon so much that we integrated their offering into our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/cloud-cannon-custom-domains&quot;&gt;app marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many respects, Lightning Lab Demo Day has become the premium event for showcasing tech start-ups here in New Zealand, and it is heartening to see our start-up ecosystem emerging on the global stage. Many hurdles still lie ahead for these companies as they look to raise cash, build out their offering and get noticed in a busy online world, but I&amp;#39;m pleased that we&amp;#39;ve been able to help in a small way towards getting them started on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The domain extensions of May, including .CLUB, .FLIGHTS and .KIWI</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May was quite the month for new top-level domains (TLDs). We saw a new popularity leader, a handful of potential favorites and a TLD for the best little island country in the Pacific. Let&amp;#39;s take a look back at the month that was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The popular pair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; (#1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert&quot;&gt;.EXPERT&lt;/a&gt; (#17)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exciting to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/this-club-is-quite-popular.html&quot;&gt;.CLUB overtake .GURU in the top spot&lt;/a&gt;, but the biggest surprise for me was .EXPERT sneaking into the top 20. Being a slightly more direct version of .GURU, .EXPERT seems to be finding its audience, even though it comes with a slightly higher price tag. Will it stay in the top 20 though? Not if new top-level domains like .WIKI have anything to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Go local with .KIWI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt; (#44)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a New Zealand-based company, it&amp;#39;s only natural for us to have a not-so-secret love for the .KIWI TLD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/a-short-interview-with-tim-johnson-ceo-of-dot-kiwi.html&quot;&gt;Back in October&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Johnson, CEO of Dot Kiwi, said his upcoming TLD was &amp;quot;Underrated and underestimated indeed - that is the definition of the challenger and the underdog. We like that position and thrive on the challenge - I think that is very Kiwi.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today, just look at it. .KIWI, the tiny TLD from New Zealand, is more popular than .COFFEE, a product served in just about every city in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The TLDs for travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cruises&quot;&gt;.CRUISES&lt;/a&gt; (#106)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-flights&quot;&gt;.FLIGHTS&lt;/a&gt; (#101)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rentals&quot;&gt;.RENTALS&lt;/a&gt; (#45)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vacations&quot;&gt;.VACATIONS&lt;/a&gt; (#104)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-villas&quot;&gt;.VILLAS&lt;/a&gt; (#104)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last week of May brought a handful of travel TLDs to the mix, and you have to assume at least one of them will rise up fairly quickly. My guess would be that .FLIGHTS and .CRUISES will become the most popular of the bunch because they both seem like common travel searches, but .RENTALS might beat them all with its multi-industry uses.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This .CLUB is quite popular</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not really in the business of pushing one top-level domain (TLD) over another (we love all our children the same), but before the launch of these new domain extensions, one TLD seemed to be more active than the rest. Instead of letting things come down to chance, the team behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; did real legwork—actively starting conversations and making things happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And their hard work seems to be paying off, as .CLUB is now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://namestat.org/&quot;&gt;most popular&lt;/a&gt; new generic top-level domain (gTLD) on the market, with daily growth more than 10x that of the second place gTLD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;. And that growth doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be slowing down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/05/27/in-da-club-50-cent-new-tld/&quot;&gt;article this morning&lt;/a&gt; about .CLUB&amp;#39;s launch party in New York, Andrew Allemann makes a really good point about gTLDs as a whole. He says, &amp;quot;If I’m going to register new top level domain names, I really want to see the registry promoting the heck out of it. So far .Club is in rare company on this front.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason so many people are still afraid of straying from the .COM namespace is because it&amp;#39;s synonymous with the internet. If it&amp;#39;s a website, it&amp;#39;s a .COM. And the only way that&amp;#39;s going to change is if people are willing to do the work needed to spread the message, which is exactly what .CLUB is trying to do. If it were up to them, every club of every kind (dance club, gold club, chess club, etc.) would have a .CLUB site, and it would be so common that it would be the TLD of choice by reflex. No decision between .COM and .CLUB—if it&amp;#39;s a club, it&amp;#39;s a .CLUB (maybe they should run with that!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s really the message every new gTLD is trying to spread, only .CLUB isn&amp;#39;t being passive about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question now is whether or not .CLUB will stay in that spot for an extended period of time. My gut feeling is that web-centric gTLDs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&quot;&gt;.BLOG&lt;/a&gt; will eventually win out, but you never know what will happen when people try hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Big week for new domains, including .WIKI, .NINJA and .FLIGHTS</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May has been a relatively slow month for generic Top-Level Domains (at least by quantity... &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; has been huge), but this last week is a big one. Over the course of two days, we have eight gTLDs coming out, with a couple of them sure to hover around the top 20 in popularity. We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;May 27&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wiki&quot;&gt;.WIKI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;May 28&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cruises&quot;&gt;.CRUISES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-flights&quot;&gt;.FLIGHTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-immobilien&quot;&gt;.IMMOBILIEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ninja&quot;&gt;.NINJA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rentals&quot;&gt;.RENTALS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vacations&quot;&gt;.VACATIONS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-villas&quot;&gt;.VILLAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders are all open until the launch dates, so get your name on the list before they open to the general public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The week for travel TLDs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel planning is a major industry on the web, and this week .CRUISES, .FLIGHTS, .RENTALS, .VACATIONS and .VILLAS are all going live on the same day. Judging by the current &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;top 10 gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;, overall popularity seems to come from a combination of memorability and price—and on the memorability front, all of these TLDs come in around seven characters, which isn&amp;#39;t too long. But the prices  could be a non-starter for some, coming in at $39 and $59 USD. For serious sites though, there&amp;#39;s a real opportunity here to get prime names for far less than on the .COM aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Free up your phone: Why email support is better</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, working for big companies, I&amp;#39;d frequently notice a strange communications phenomenon. If I sent someone a quick chat message or email with a question or request for info, they would respond — by calling me or coming over to my desk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to figure out why people wouldn&amp;#39;t just reply via the same channel as the inquiry. But eventually it sunk in that different people just prefer to communicate in different ways. Everyone has a mental hierarchy of the preference, value, appropriateness, and efficiency of different types of communication. These are based on their own personalities, modes of learning, and past experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why when some people need help, the one and only goal is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If I can just get a human on the phone...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years that I&amp;#39;ve worked in community management and customer support, this bit of learning has grown a lot. It now also encompasses &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you communicate (level of tech-speak, industry jargon, community membership, language familiarity, etc.) And I&amp;#39;m intimately aware of the advantages and limitations of text. (Though the myth that something like 90% of communication is nonverbal, and thus utterly lost in text, has been pretty much busted.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to work for iwantmyname, I was glad to learn that we handle support entirely online. Yes, we do get inquiries about phone support, which is understandable. People are used to that option. Some still equate talking to a &amp;quot;real live human&amp;quot; with being more likely to resolve an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s actually much better for our customer service not to offer phone support. Can some things be easily resolved by &amp;quot;a quick call&amp;quot;? Certainly. But for most people, figuring out a delay in a domain transfer or working with DNS records can&amp;#39;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing support online keeps everything in one place. We can see the inquiry or issue you&amp;#39;re contacting us about, and link it to others if there is duplication or related inquiries. We can also see previous communication threads that we&amp;#39;ve had with you, which might tell us if there&amp;#39;s been something ongoing, or something that might have changed that could help with diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see your account directly, and so we can likely see what the situation is more quickly. We can respond with customized instructions, fix it ourselves, or give clearer information to the developers if we need to escalate. Most of our responses contain URLs to direct people to the right pages. Can&amp;#39;t really pass those along over the phone. We can also send screenshots or even video to show you exactly what steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked on helping people fix things for a decade or so, I can fairly confidently (and with love) say that many people are not very good at describing problems. That&amp;#39;s not their fault. The average person simply doesn&amp;#39;t have a deep enough understanding of the systems they&amp;#39;re using to accurately describe what&amp;#39;s not working. Nor should they – that&amp;#39;s my job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if someone calls you up and says, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My website is broken!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s going to take a while to get to the root of what, exactly, isn&amp;#39;t working and why. The cause could be one or more of a hundred things. Far more efficient is if you&amp;#39;re kind enough to provide us as much relevant information as you can when you contact us. And, ideally, send us an authenticated request when logged in to your account. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/signin&quot;&gt;Login to your account&lt;/a&gt;, click &lt;strong&gt;Support&lt;/strong&gt; in the main dashboard menu, and fill out that form.) We can do a lot more for you, securely, under those circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voices can carry a lot more inflection than text can, but the global nature of the Internet can be challenging. Especially with more of the world going mobile, the quality of all voice communications is not equal. We might have to give you information that is much easier to just copy and paste, like nameservers, IP addresses, etc. Or if I&amp;#39;m having a particularly Canadian day, you&amp;#39;re not at the mercy of my pronunciations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further to that idea of voices carrying more inflection and getting &amp;quot;a human&amp;quot; on the phone, I hate to say it, but sometimes people aren&amp;#39;t very nice. Yeah, it&amp;#39;s understandable. Something&amp;#39;s not working, you don&amp;#39;t know why, you&amp;#39;re frustrated. But being loud or rude to the folks who can help really isn&amp;#39;t going to do anyone any good. It&amp;#39;s not going to make you feel better or get the issue fixed sooner, and we&amp;#39;ll remember you as &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; person. People using lots of CAPS or exclamation points isn&amp;#39;t pleasant, but it has less impact than having someone unnecessarily yelling at you on the phone. We want to enjoy our work days as much as possible, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the dramatic media potential of online security threats, online support actually is  more secure for everyone. Authentication helps us determine that the person contacting us, or accessing the account, is the account (or domain) owner. If we receive non-authenticated requests, we can respond in a way that requires the person receiving the instructions to know how to access the account for them to be of use. It&amp;#39;s been over 20 years, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you&amp;#x27;re_a_dog&quot;&gt;this cartoon&lt;/a&gt; still provides a wise point of which to remain aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who&amp;#39;s sat on hold for an hour trying to get something fixed with an airline or cable company, you know that &amp;quot;a quick call&amp;quot; is often a myth. It depends on the size of the support team, the volume of calls, the types of inquiries or issues, and many other extenuating circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work to solve support tickets as quickly as we can, but we&amp;#39;re a small team, some of us are newer and still learning (me!), and some issues need help from developers or the registry. Those can&amp;#39;t be solved in the space of a phone call. With support via email, we can let you know that we&amp;#39;re working on it, then update you when we know more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our team can be anywhere in the world at a given time, so we&amp;#39;re not really in a position to implement a call centre-like phone system. We choose to focus on domains and DNS, and work on making domain management a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; experience. We want to support our customers the best way we can, and doing so online is the better way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname culture: The &quot;work-from-anywhere experiment&quot;</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last post I talked about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&quot;&gt;one salary experiment&lt;/a&gt; and got a lot of feedback. One point that kept coming up was that we may run into the problem of a limited talent pool as we have no real way of attracting anyone with a higher salary than we currently pay. While this may be a limiting factor, the salary is only one aspect of working at iwantmyname. Today, I&amp;#39;ll talk about a second aspect, one that also addresses our talent pool size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a company built on the idea that we want to be able to work from anywhere, and because we&amp;#39;re an Internet-based business, we have no need for a fixed location. We work on a global network, and as long as we have access to it, we can be productive. And we&amp;#39;re not alone in this—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovehq.com/blog/being-a-remote-team&quot;&gt;quite a few startups have shifted to working either entirely as a distributed team&lt;/a&gt; or with remote workers who contribute. But we, as with many things, try to push this envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love camping, and here in New Zealand it&amp;#39;s not hard to take your work outside. The wireless coverage you can get across large parts of the country enables me to camp out on remote beaches for days and work from there. This, for me, is the ultimate work/life balance. But not all of us like camping, and even I don&amp;#39;t live in a camper all the time, so we regularly have people working from home, co-working spaces or the office in Wellington. We have no policy on where you have to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For half of this year I&amp;#39;ll be living in Berlin, working out of a co-working space and connecting with the startup community in Europe. Many of us love traveling, and the company setup we have enables everyone to do that. We have team members that travel for half the year and are back in Wellington for the rest, we have people that work from Canada and the US most of the time, while others are mainly in Wellington. The freedom of choice and the opportunity to set your schedule as you please brings us very close to &amp;quot;work whenever you want from wherever you want&amp;quot; dream. The only really fixed thing at iwantmyname is our weekly meeting. Once a week we all meet either in person in the office or via video link for everyone who is remote and talk about what we&amp;#39;re working on, what we plan to do next, where we are and how we feel. This weekly chat where everyone sees each other is the only time where everyone makes an effort to be at a place where the internet is good enough for video chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are limits to this. There has to be at least one developer on call with internet access 24/7 in case things go wrong. There also needs to be at least one supporter that looks after our customers&amp;#39; needs at any time, and so on. But, with everyone working pretty closely with everyone else, we know when someone needs a break, is working from a country where internet coverage is bad, or if part of the team is at Burning Man and has no internet at all. It all comes down to communication with the team and respectful planning. So the above &amp;quot;work whenever you want from wherever you want&amp;quot; has, in reality, a qualifier of &amp;quot;as long as you respect the team and our customers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the remote work opportunities, why then do we have an office at all? Turns out, having an office is awesome. You can hang out together if you want. Chat, have fun. An office is a very social place, and even though I&amp;#39;m often most productive when I work from home, time in the office is important when we collaborate to develop new features. It&amp;#39;s also a good place for Friday drinks when we have other startups over or host user groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having fun is an integral part of what we do at iwantmyname. Having fun makes sure our product is built by a team that likes doing what they do. In my opinion, working only for the sake of making money makes work a sad place. If financial incentives are the only reason you work where you work, then the products that come out are artifacts of people trying to drop the keyboard at 5pm to do fun things. I can&amp;#39;t see those being products that will be fun for people to use. And this puts a much different perspective on the talent pool we draw from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continue reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;part two&lt;/strong&gt; of an ongoing series about the culture of iwantmyname. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It&#39;s OK to use tools</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas Downey on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3752-its-ok-not-to-use-tools&quot;&gt;process to improve a website&lt;/a&gt; for a local non-profit animal shelter - via Signal v. Noise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a basic HTML/CSS site seems almost passé. But why? Is it because our new tools are so significantly better, or because we’ve gone overboard complicating simple things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As builders, we like tools and tech because they’re interesting and new, and we enjoy mastering them. But when you think about the people we’re building for, the reality is usually the opposite. They need simple designs, clear writing, less tech, and fewer abstractions. They want to get stray animals adopted, not fuss around with website stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As builders, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; OK to use tools if they&amp;#39;re designed to help the people you&amp;#39;re building for. We know how a site should look and feel, so why not use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder&quot;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address&quot;&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/wix-make-flash-website-own-url&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt; to set it up, then pass on the final result to the clients to manage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently in the process of redoing a website for a small local gym as a side project, and I could develop their site from scratch or on a self-hosted CMS. But instead, I&amp;#39;ve decided to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;hosted platform&lt;/a&gt; instead. They&amp;#39;ve come a long way in the last few years, and they let me achieve my client&amp;#39;s goals while giving them the ability to manage and edit their content without help in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Philippines disaster, six months downstream</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may recall that we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&quot;&gt;made a commitment&lt;/a&gt; last year to contribute a portion of our earnings towards charitable purposes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html&quot;&gt;Typhoon Haiyan&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most powerful tropical storms in recorded history and led to over 6,000 deaths when it struck the Philippines in November 2013. With the island nation sitting near our own back doorstep in Asia-Pacific, it was not a difficult choice where to spend the money this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked really hard at the many aid agencies working in the region and weighed up a number of indices demonstrating effectiveness. In the end we invested via Save The Children and specifically asked that the donation go towards recovery operations in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months on from the disaster it has been heart-warming to observe media coverage of how emergency aid agencies have been helping the people of the affected region get their lives back on track. Food, water, medical supplies, housing, sanitation, communications—the list of needs is endless.

				<title>13 new domain extensions for real estate websites</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate is, and will likely always be, a huge employment sector. But for many real estate agents, the web has just recently become a necessary tool of the trade. These days, websites are the first points of reference for home buyers and the biggest marketing tool any agent will possess. And that makes finding a memorable domain name hugely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a quick Google search, I&amp;#39;m finding that most local agents are using a YOURNAMErealestate.com or YOURNAMErealty.com naming convention. And there&amp;#39;s fine, but wouldn&amp;#39;t YOURNAME.realestate or YOURNAME.realty be better? That&amp;#39;s three characters you can cut from your domain (com), and that can make a big difference when printing business cards, displaying ads or committing names to memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of .COM, here are some great new and upcoming generic top-level domains (gTLDs) you could use instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Broad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-broker&quot;&gt;.BROKER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-realestate&quot;&gt;.REALESTATE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-realty&quot;&gt;.REALTY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Specific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-condos&quot;&gt;.CONDOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-forsale&quot;&gt;.FORSALE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-lease&quot;&gt;.LEASE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-management&quot;&gt;.MANAGEMENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-properties&quot;&gt;.PROPERTIES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-property&quot;&gt;.PROPERTY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rent&quot;&gt;.RENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rentals&quot;&gt;.RENTALS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vacations&quot;&gt;.VACATIONS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-villas&quot;&gt;.VILLAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A few naming tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really applies to any industry, but the most important factor when determining a domain name should be memorability. And today, the most memorable sites are short .COMs. The problem many people are running into is that the list of available short .COMs is shrinking, so moving to a newer gTLD like .REALTY can be a good alternative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, with a newer gTLD, you can often skip the FIRSTLAST.TLD naming convention (chrishall.realty) and move to something a bit shorter like LAST.TLD (hall.realty) because there more domains available. Always play around with your domain name before registering to get the shortest relevant option. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An introduction to Postach.io with @nerdburn</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog platforms come in all shapes and sizes, but some of the more interesting platforms today are the ones that work without traditional hosting space. And with Evernote recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/05/13/evernote-reaches-100-million-users/&quot;&gt;topping 100 million users&lt;/a&gt;, we thought it&amp;#39;d be the perfect time to ask cofounder &lt;a href=&quot;http://nerdburn.com/&quot;&gt;Shawn Adrian&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nerdburn&quot;&gt;@nerdburn&lt;/a&gt;) about his Evernote-powered blog platform, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postachio&quot;&gt;Postach.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ll start with the million dollar question. How does Postach.io/Evernote blogging work? Is it easy to make a site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Our whole goal with creating Postach.io was, and still is, to make web publishing easy, with fewer steps. From the feedback we’re getting from people I think we’re on the right track. People love the simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a site, you simply connect your Evernote account, choose a site name, then tag content “published” in Evernote to post to it. It literally takes only couple of minutes to be blogging, quite professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What does a Postach.io site look like? Are there themes? Do I need to know any code or anything to change things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; You can check out a bunch of Postach.io sites by visiting our &lt;a href=&quot;http://postach.io/discover&quot;&gt;Discover feed&lt;/a&gt;—although we need to work on the algorithm that brings interesting content to the top, you’ll see a variety of sites on Discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently have 13 themes, and all are fully responsive for web and mobile. Right now, to create a theme you need to know HTML and CSS, but we’re working on making it much easier to customize the presentation without code knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there any disadvantage to Postach.io in terms or SEO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Nope, in fact, our customers have shared that by using Postach.io they’ve seen more traffic to their blog posts than before they migrated over. We’ve done a lot to ensure we’re coding our themes according to latest best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of related to SEO, are there any speed concerns with Postach.io? Is it as fast as a traditional blog hosting platform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Feel free to test it! One of our secret fetishes here is building scalable apps. It&amp;#39;s a thrill to get hit with a bomb of traffic then see the server handle it without a hiccup. What a rush! We’re confident that Postach.io sites stand up to the best of them when talking about speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Since Postach.io works in Evernote, can I bring in things like social integrations, analytics platforms and comment systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a ton of integrations and embeds, but we’re working on more as well. In the coming months you’re going to see even deeper integrations to popular platforms—currently we support Google Analytics, Disqus commenting, SoundCloud, YouTube, Vimeo, Mathjax, Gist, Slideshare and a bunch of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt;  So the Postach.io &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.postach.io/postach-io-premium-announcement&quot;&gt;premium tier&lt;/a&gt; recently came out. What&amp;#39;s included? And how much is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s $50 a year, and it includes the ability to collaborate on a site with another person, and password protection. It’s a great option for small businesses and teams, or people who want one of our t-shirts, included with every premium subscription :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt;  What will Postach.io look like in the future? Any big updates in the works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh man, I’m glad you asked. We proved the concept by launching an Evernote powered blogging platform, but the real magic isn’t specifically in using Evernote, it’s blogging using the tools you love to author content in, like Evernote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer we’re rolling out support for something like 10 more platforms, so you can write, collect, or capture content in the platform of your choice and it will automatically be live and beautiful on your Postach.io site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt;  Last question, and be honest here. How much do you like pistachio ice cream? Best thing anyone could ever eat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I can’t speak for the rest of the team here, but I’m curiously fascinated by pistachio ice cream. It’s not love yet, but the taste is curious and I have a crush. We’ll see where it goes! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geekforbrains&quot;&gt;Gavin&lt;/a&gt;, my cofounder, actually thought of our name. He has a habit of waking up in the night with ideas, and this one came to him at 4am. He might be a bigger fan of pistachio ice cream than I am ;)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Interesting tidbits on branded email addresses from a recent Google survey</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no magic recipe of apps and tools you should and shouldn&amp;#39;t use to guarantee business success, but it seems the days of getting by without branded email addresses are (finally) coming to a close. From a consumer&amp;#39;s point of view, a random &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;@yahoo.com&lt;/code&gt; address will never compare to &lt;code&gt;@brand.tld&lt;/code&gt;, and the logical connection is that consumer trust weighs heavily in the purchasing process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in the world of business decisions, sometimes logic needs to be backed up with facts, and the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/youngbizsurveyreport.pdf&quot;&gt;Google survey of young businesses&lt;/a&gt; is just what the doctor ordered. Here are some interesting tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;By nearly three to one (60% vs. 23%), those who got a professional email address after they started their business saw an increase in customer engagement.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;42% of respondents said they saw an increase in sales after getting a professional email address.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The majority of respondents (59%) said a professional email address has a high impact on customer trust, with half (50%) of respondents saying such an email address has a high impact on having happy customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Among consumers surveyed who are more likely to communicate with or buy from a business with a professional email address, 47% said it is because they have more confidence in the business’ legitimacy.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to setup your own branded email address, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;how to get a custom email address&amp;quot; guide&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>10 platforms for building your small business website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a small business often means running on paper-thin margins, and in many cases, hiring a professional to build and design a website is simply impossible. But having a solid website is a necessity in today&amp;#39;s market, so it&amp;#39;s more important than ever to find a website platform you can figure out without much headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you jump into it though, do a bit of research. Here are ten of the best no-skill-required platforms for getting your small business online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-squarespace-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Squarespace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - Squarespace is one of the biggest web platforms around, and has been adding bigger and better features to its repertoire at a rapid pace. With its simple interface and beautiful, responsive templates, you can create interactive pages with photo galleries, custom logos, blog posts and social integrations. And with a full e-commerce platform, you can even sell your goods directly from your website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-virb-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Virb&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://virb.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - For most users, Virb is nearly identical to Squarespace, offering its own collection of wonderful responsive templates with amazing tools for integrating photos, blog posts and social media. Squarespace does have the upper hand with a stable of mobile apps and small features, but it really comes down to which interface you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-weebly-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Weebly&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address&quot;&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)- Weebly might not get the press Squarespace receives, but it does have an incredibly impressive drag-and-drop site creation tool that beats just about any other platform in usability. Additionally, you get all the blog, site and social tools you&amp;#39;d expect from a full-featured platform for less than the bigger competition (many business could probably get by with only the free tier).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-strikingly-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Strikingly&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/strikingly-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Strikingly&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strikingly.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - Strikingly takes a slightly different approach to site building, eschewing big, multi-page sites for simple sites with only one page. So instead of having a navigation link to an About page, Strikingly just moves you down to where your About information is on your one-page site. It might sound crazy, but in the age where more and more people are accessing sites from mobile devices, scrolling makes a whole lot more sense then jumping to pages with tiny text links and buttons. And when you&amp;#39;re building a site, creating one great page is a lot easier than coming up with good content for a multi-page site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-one-pager-business.png&quot; alt=&quot;One Pager&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/onepage-business-websites&quot;&gt;One Pager&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://onepagerapp.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - If you like the single page idea of Strikingly, you&amp;#39;ll also love One Pager. One Pager strips all the excess from traditional site builders and simply focuses on getting things done. And with a stable of templates, form builders and e-commerce tools, it may just be the utilitarian platform you&amp;#39;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-wix-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wix&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/wix-make-flash-website-own-url&quot;&gt;Wix&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wix.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - Wix is a lot like Weebly in that it let&amp;#39;s you build a fully featured small business site with a simple drag-and-drop interface, but the differentiator is that Wix has hundreds of templates to choose from. No matter what kind of small business you have, there&amp;#39;s a template for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-yola-business.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yola&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/customise-yola-with-personal-url&quot;&gt;Yola&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yola.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - Big, beautiful sites with oversized images and trendy templates are all the rage, but some businesses just need a conservative site that covers all the bases—and that&amp;#39;s Yola&amp;#39;s comfort zone. That&amp;#39;s not to say that you can&amp;#39;t create a modern site with Yola, you&amp;#39;re just not pushed in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-zoho-sites-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Zoho Sites&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/register-domain-zoho-sites&quot;&gt;Zoho Sites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoho.com/sites/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - If you&amp;#39;re looking for a no-nonsense small business site builder on the cheap, Zoho Sites might be what you want. Its most expensive plan is less than $10/mo and the free tier comes with everything many businesses will need to get started. Plus, you can easily integrate your site with the free Zoho Mail, making the Zoho suite very budget friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-jimdo-business.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jimdo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/jimdo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Jimdo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimdo.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - Jimdo is another easy tool for getting sites up, and like Yola, has plenty of templates for less edgy sites (although you can make any site look like just about anything you want). The e-commerce platform is also quite popular, with simple tools to help you get your products online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-14-moonfruit-business.png&quot; alt=&quot;Moonfruit&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/moonfruit-simple-website-builder&quot;&gt;Moonfruit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moonfruit.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) - Moonfruit is a modern platform that lets you simply add content, photos and shop features. And if you really like the platform but don&amp;#39;t want to mess with the building process, you can use their new KickStart Beta to have them build one for you—for a price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more specialized small business platforms, we&amp;#39;ve created lists for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/13-platforms-for-creating-a-customizable-online-store.html&quot;&gt;customizable online stores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/platforms-for-building-restaurant-websites.html&quot;&gt;restaurant site builders&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>Celebrating 100,000 domains at iwantmyname!</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-13-iwantmyname-growth.png&quot; alt=&quot;iwantmyname growth&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re just a few months past our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&quot;&gt;5th birthday&lt;/a&gt; now, and we&amp;#39;re proud to announce that we&amp;#39;ve crossed a major milestone: 100,000 domains managed by iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s still tiny compared to the big players in the industry, but we&amp;#39;ve now proven our theory that there&amp;#39;s room on the web for a domain management service that does things a bit differently. Our mission from the start was to focus on easy-to-use, straightforward domain hosting, while getting out of our customers&amp;#39; way so that they can quickly set up their own web addresses. Simple and honest &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain pricing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/no-upselling-tactics-to-be-found-here.html&quot;&gt;no annoying upselling&lt;/a&gt; and a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;great customer service&lt;/a&gt; helped us get to where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a company perspective, we&amp;#39;re thrilled to have achieved this as a bootstrapped startup from a remote corner of the world (in case you didn&amp;#39;t know, we&amp;#39;re based in Wellington, New Zealand). However, we very much see ourselves as an international company, with 90% of our customers being from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the people who made all this possible: our customers. It&amp;#39;s inspiring to see your ideas coming to life—the countless Tumblr sites making us laugh, blogs we&amp;#39;re reading every day, great apps from great developers, shops selling awesome t-shirts and designers blowing the interwebs away with their artwork. You are the reason we get up every morning (and stay up late). Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A few interesting facts and tidbits from behind the scenes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The oldest domain currently under management was registered nearly 24 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;ve processed more than 200,000 registrations, renewals and transfers over the last 5.5 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took us a year to get to 1,000 domains under management and just a bit over 4 years for the remaining 99,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;212 different domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; and are adding more &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&quot;&gt;on a weekly basis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your domains are being looked after by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;9 people&lt;/a&gt; (4 developers, 2 support, 1 product, 1 operations, 1 content)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 cents from each domain registered &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&quot;&gt;goes to global aid initiatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What&amp;#39;s coming next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simple. We will continue with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;our mission&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that any person, organisation or company should have complete control over their web address. You should be able to own it, use it the way you want and move it if necessary. This can all be achieved by registering a domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; being released over the next few years, and we&amp;#39;ll do our very best to make them easier than ever to find, manage and own at iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.IO gets cheaper and more secure (i.e. better)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no secret that the tech community loves the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; top-level domain (TLD), and it&amp;#39;s been especially popular with our savvy customers. So it delights us to say that .IO is improving in two ways—the price is going down and WHOIS masking is being enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reduced price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new standard price of .IO is &lt;strong&gt;$59 USD&lt;/strong&gt;, down from $69 USD. We&amp;#39;re still running a .IO registration sale for $49 USD, so the new price reduction will come into play upon renewal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Whois masking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-09-whois-privacy-masking-protection.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy is a huge concern for many people, but until now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425&quot;&gt;WHOIS masking&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;#39;t available for .IO domains. Now, when you enable WHOIS masking from your dashboard, you&amp;#39;ll be able to hide your street address, city and phone number from the public (as shown in the image above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we&amp;#39;ve dropped the price to $59 USD and added WHOIS masking for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sh-domain-name-registration-for-saint-helena&quot;&gt;.SH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-international-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island&quot;&gt;.AC&lt;/a&gt;, the domain extensions for Saint Helena and Ascension Island. Both make great &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt;, so get brainstorming! &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname culture: The &quot;one salary experiment&quot;</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our blog we talk a lot about what happens in the industry we are in,
what happens on the web and around our company but not too often about
how we actually run iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that building useful products needs a functioning team, a
team that can focus on helping our customers, fixing bugs and shipping
features. We work hard to get everything sorted that could get in the
way of that for everyone in our team. Many companies talk nowadays about
optimising for happiness, Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos) often talks about
it at conferences, Github has it as one of their core principles and we
work towards achieving exactly that. But what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write a few blog posts about what we do in iwantmyname and the
experiments we run and how that pans out so far. I hope that we can be
an inspiration to others that are looking for alternative ways to
running companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the experiments that we are running in iwantmyname since we
started is the &amp;quot;one-salary-experiment&amp;quot;. At iwantmyname everyone earns
the same. This sounds strange to many and I get asked a lot of questions
how this may work once we grow bigger and the honest answer is: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t
know, but so far it works&amp;quot; and I give that same answer since we started
5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying idea has two main roots. First, we really think that
everyone is as important to the success of our team as anyone else in
the team. We don&amp;#39;t believe in hierarchy or in more important people. If
we hire you, we think you are valuable and want you to be part of our
team as a level peer, not an underling that does the stuff no one else
wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second angle we looked at is incentives around achievements.
Financial incentives work well for repetitive work but for creative work
financial incentives are counter productive. If you are interested in
backgrounds to that watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation&quot;&gt;TED talk of Dan Pink&lt;/a&gt; about motivation as a
start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take the whole salary discussion out of the things to worry about we
just increase salaries for everyone as we grow, automagically, no action
required. It also means everyone knows what everyone else earns, full
transparency for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has a few positive side effects we initially did not think of. One
is gender equality, we have a guarantee that there is no gender gap.
Another is the stressful moment where we, the more introvert geeks, walk
up to who ever we discuss salaries with and need to re-negotiate what we
earn. It is never pleasant, for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment is working really well for us so far and I really don&amp;#39;t
see a reason why we can&amp;#39;t scale it up. It really helps us to not loose
time with something everyone needs to live but also never quite knows
how to negotiate. I think it is a very honest way of renumeration and it
is at the core of our idea around how our team works, a group of peers
working on an idea, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll write a few more posts about other culture and company experiments
at iwantmyname. If there is any topic you are more interested in or
something you really want to know about us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continue reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;part one&lt;/strong&gt; of an ongoing series about the culture of iwantmyname. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New York, London and Paris will soon be joining .BERLIN with new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to estimate the potential popularity of any new top-level domain (TLD), but I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that city TLDs are going to be a big deal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;—the first city TLD—is currently the second most popular new TLD available with nearly 50,000 domains registered. And that number will certainly rise once the TLD gains traction with more local businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think about it—if you owned a small business in Berlin, wouldn&amp;#39;t it make more sense to use .BERLIN than a generic TLD like .COM or a country-code TLD (ccTLD) like .DE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And .BERLIN is only the start. The current list of city TLDs currently available for pre-order includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&quot;&gt;.LONDON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-paris&quot;&gt;.PARIS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&quot;&gt;.TOKYO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dubai&quot;&gt;.DUBAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-quebec&quot;&gt;.QUEBEC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sydney&quot;&gt;.SYDNEY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas&quot;&gt;.VEGAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-helsinki&quot;&gt;.HELSINKI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-capetown&quot;&gt;.CAPETOWN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s just a sample. In our &amp;quot;City &amp;amp; Regions&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; we have 51 TLDs—all of which have large built-in audiences that, if .BERLIN is any indication, will get onboard fairly quickly. So if you&amp;#39;re a local business owner (or savvy resident) in a city getting its own TLD, now is the time to get your name on the pre-order list.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Go mobile! 6 web/blog platforms with beautiful mobile apps</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re probably closer than we&amp;#39;d ever think to fully migrating from traditional computers to mobile hybrids, so it seemed appropriate to highlight the platforms in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; that are ahead of the curve. From mobile blogging to full-on page editing, you could almost run your entire presence via mobile with the help of these six platforms and their apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/jimdo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Jimdo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimdo.com/mobile/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id588950703?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;): Aside from being beautiful, Jimdo&amp;#39;s mobile app lets you write blog posts, add photos and monitor your site&amp;#39;s analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/rebelmouse-custom-domain&quot;&gt;RebelMouse&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rebelmouse/id725539211?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rebelmouse.android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;): Compiling your online presence into one site is a nifty idea, and the RebelMouse app completely sets you free from your computer. You can create posts from any photo, link or page, share and repost tweets and messages and view other RebelMouse pages in a standardized stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/roon-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Roon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roon/id634949849?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;): Markdown fans will love using the Roon app, as its content editor rivals many of the Markdown editors in the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;

You can share photos, videos, quotes, chats, links and text—and it even has an offline mode for those moments you just can&amp;#39;t find a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using ALIAS-type DNS records for CNAME functionality on naked domains, and an easier alternative</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve ever wanted to set up domains using cloud hosting services like Heroku or Windows Azure, you&amp;#39;ve probably come across a limitation with their platforms in regards to using naked domains (the version without the &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; part, which is also called zone apex or root domain). There are two underlying problems here, due to the nature of how the Domain Name System works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNAME records must not be used on naked domains, meaning they will ask you to use a sub-domain, e.g. &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; for your site or app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are unable to provide you with A records for setting up naked domains due to scalability issues. If there is an attack on their infrastructure, it would take down all sites using the same A record(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario leaves you with two different options for setting up custom domains, both of which we will explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Option 1: ALIAS-type DNS records&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer for why you must not use CNAME records with naked domains is simple. It&amp;#39;s not allowed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt&quot;&gt;because the DNS specification says so&lt;/a&gt; (and some registries are very strict about this). While you can do it theoretically, there are certain side effects—the main one being that email services on your domain &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/not-receiving-email-check-for-cname-record-on-root-domain.html&quot;&gt;will only work intermittently&lt;/a&gt;, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where DNS hosting services offering CNAME functionality on the zone apex come into play. As of writing this article, here are the companies that provide such a solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dnsmadeeasy.com&quot;&gt;DNSMadeEasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dnsimple.com&quot;&gt;DNSimple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pointdns.com&quot;&gt;PointDNS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/route53/&quot;&gt;Amazon Route 53&lt;/a&gt; (only for hosting on AWS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these services is as easy as updating your nameservers to theirs at your domain registrar. However, please note that there are no official standards around ALIAS-type DNS records yet, and there may be issues with general service availability, content delivery networks and DNSSEC. Some domain extensions like .IS don&amp;#39;t even allow it. Also, if you do decide to use this method for domain mapping, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/why-alias-type-records-break-the-internet.html&quot;&gt;be aware of the implications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Option 2: URL forwarding as alternative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to simply forward the naked domain &amp;#39;yoursitename.com&amp;#39; to the &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; sub-domain. Most domain registrars and DNS hosting services offer URL forwarding. If you set up Heroku or other hosted apps with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;our one-click services setup&lt;/a&gt;, we take care of this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should your registrar charge extra for URL forwarding (some do) there are services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rootredirect.com/&quot;&gt;RootRedirect.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://wwwizer.com&quot;&gt;wwwizer&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to achieve the same setup. The latter also offers a paid plan which gives you a dedicated IP address, and even includes an SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use forwarding, the main disadvantage is a cosmetic one—using the &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; sub-domain as your primary address. But that&amp;#39;s a small price to pay for a standards-compliant domain and DNS setup, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re always happy to highlight the great platforms coming out of the Wellington, NZ tech scene, but we&amp;#39;re especially happy to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoistapps.com/&quot;&gt;Hoist&lt;/a&gt; right in our backyard (and in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/hoist-custom-domain&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for simple one-click iwantmyname installs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a bit more info about the company and what their future holds, we reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoistapps.com/blog/meet-owen-evans/&quot;&gt;Owen Evans&lt;/a&gt;, Hoist&amp;#39;s co-founder and CTO with a few questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Naming is always an interesting topic for startups. How did you come up with the name Hoist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;d love to say there was an interesting and long time spent over Hoist as a name, but it came early in the piece. I&amp;#39;ve always believed in brand as something for people to get a sense of community about, and having a solid name was going to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June 2013 we got together to work out what we were going to try and solve and what we wanted from a business. Part of the process was to give ourselves a name and we spent an hour throwing words related to applications, cloud, software and infrastructure on a whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then discussed a few key words that worked well as evocative imagery, but Hoist became a clear favorite and has done well to represent what we&amp;#39;re trying to achieve (helping people get their applications into the cloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;re based in New Zealand. Do you see this as a disadvantage as a startup and what are the main challenges?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: New Zealand is like nowhere else on earth, it&amp;#39;s such an amazing lifestyle that there are few times I wish I was elsewhere. We have the ability to enjoy the great outdoors, a closely connected tech and entrepreneurial scene and a great support network for aspiring entrepreneurs. I moved to Wellington from London and I often wonder if I would have been able to start a company there, just because in the time I&amp;#39;ve been in New Zealand I&amp;#39;ve met so many supportive and awesome people who made it much more possible for me personally to start out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: Unfortunately, there&amp;#39;s no getting away from the remoteness of NZ, and you really have to live here to understand truly what that means (I keep having to point out to my friends back in the UK that the closest place not in NZ is a three hour plane ride) That leads to a bunch of issues around cost of supply and such, but also leads to a lot of support for software startups as there&amp;#39;s a recognition that they could transform the NZ economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a very small native market; to put it in perspective there are more small businesses in California than people in NZ, that means your core market and sources of capital are likely to be offshore. that means a fair bit of travel and market research to understand the main market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;#39;s the difference between Hoist and other cloud hosting platforms like Heroku?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoist and Heroku both provide ways to host cloud apps, but where Heroku&amp;#39;s focus leans more to infrastructure, Hoist leans more to integrations. We&amp;#39;ve built the easiest way for a developer to create a &amp;quot;feature app&amp;quot; - i.e. to extend existing cloud apps with bespoke features as well as for single page applications built entirely in Javascript/HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As SaaS becomes more and more prevalent and SMBs take on a best-of-breed approach to SaaS, there are a lot of these light-weight apps and integrations happening. Our platform is ideal for connecting to an API and adding value through a well designed user interface with a Hoist backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; We see that you&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoistapps.com/blog/ship-day-new-hoist-features/&quot;&gt;recently added&lt;/a&gt; buckets and connectors  to Hoist--what kinds of upgrades/additions are you guys working on next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;re working on making application upload better (we&amp;#39;re aware our current file upload solution was a bit janky; integrations such as Github and Dropbox will make that better), adding APIs for GeoOp, WorkflowMax and others as well as some work on building an API to make SaaS billing much easier for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re also focusing on a few commercial apps going live thanks to EndGame, and as such we&amp;#39;ve got a few features being built out from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Having an awesome tech stack is like a badge of honor for us, and it looks like yours is quite nice, too. What are you running on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoist is primarily built on Node.js and MongoDB. We originally used CouchDB as well, but it meant one too many things for us to manage in house. Node.js was picked primarily because we saw that the language of the cloud was JSON and it made sense to transform as little as possible for understandability and speed. We love working on the stack as it&amp;#39;s quick, easy to use and performs really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also manage all our server configuration using Chef, which makes setting up servers a breeze and plays nicely with all the cloud infrastructure we use.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The updated big list of static website generators for your site, blog or wiki</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic websites certainly have their place on the internet, but you may find the enhanced security, performance and ease of hosting a static site to be just what you need. So here&amp;#39;s the big list of static site generators (the sequel to Timo&amp;#39;s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;32 static website generators for your site, blog or wiki&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;) to get you started, sorted by language/platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Writing a comprehensive list of static site generators would be nearly impossible (the quantity is astounding), and not all that useful, so the following list only contains generators that are actively being maintained and/or have a decent website. If you have anything to add to the list, just let us know via Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;@iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A closer look at using Authy for two-factor authentication</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/a-practical-look-at-using-iwantmynames-two-factor-authentication.html&quot;&gt;went over&lt;/a&gt; using a setting up two-factor authentication, so now lets do a quick dive into Authy itself. Specifically about what it is, what platforms you can use it on and how the Authy setup works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/71272779?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Authy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2013/07/authy/&quot;&gt;From Klint Finley - Wired:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authy is one of several companies working to bring a security technique called “two-factor authentication” to the masses. With two-factor authentication, you provide more than just a username and password when you log into a service. You provide additional credentials, such as a hardware dongle, a fingerprint, or a unique PIN number that was just text-messaged to your phone. That way, even if someone knows your password, they can’t find their way into your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Authy’s service isn’t something you use all on your own. You need help from third-party software developers. The company offers tools that let developers add its two-factor authentication to specific applications. Then, if you use one of these third-party apps, Authy provides another tool that ties into the app and manages your credentials. This tool can also double as a client for Google Authenticator, a similar service from the web search giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Downloading Authy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways you can set Authy up now, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gaedmjdfmmahhbjefcbgaolhhanlaolb&quot;&gt;Google Chrome for Mac, Linux or Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authy for Chrome is brand new (here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.authy.com/authy-for-pc&quot;&gt;official announcement&lt;/a&gt;), and lets you authenticate all your codes right from your computer. &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/28/authy-brings-two-factor-authentication-to-the-desktop/&quot;&gt;From Frederic Lardinois - TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the company’s founder and CEO Daniel Palacio told me last week, being able to get your second factor from your desktop and laptop makes for a far more seamless user experience. Instead of typing in a code, you can just copy and paste it from the desktop app. For those users who don’t have a smartphone, this also provides an easier alternative to the usual SMS messages services like Authy utilize to send their codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doesn’t that defeat the purpose of a two-factor application? Authy — unsurprisingly — claims it doesn’t. “Two-factor authentication is still valid regardless of whether the second authentication factor ‘you have’ comes from your cellphone, your tablet, or right from a desktop app in your laptop,” the company writes in a blog post today. “What really matters, is that it is something only you can have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What the setup looks like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally have Authy downloaded on iOS and Chrome, so I&amp;#39;ll walk through what the setups looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-02-authy-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;setup iOS&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you download the app, you&amp;#39;re shown a screen that lets you attach a phone number to your Authy app. Then, to verify that you are the owner of the phone number, you just follow the directions in the screen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-02-authy-ver.png&quot; alt=&quot;verification iOS&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you add your number into a platform like iwantmyname, verifications and such will go to the correct device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-02-authy-chrome.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you install Authy for Chrome, you&amp;#39;re shown a similar screen as the iOS install that lets you enter your phone number. Just add it in, type in the code from the following text and you&amp;#39;re good to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Find more information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to find more information about Authy, here are a few good places to start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find answers to common questions, or ask your own, on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authy.com/faq&quot;&gt;Authy FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet Authy &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Authy&quot;&gt;@authy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authy has 11 informational videos on &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user13020702/videos&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>The current top 10 new domain extensions are probably not what you&#39;d expect (.GURU is still #1)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), I fully expected the domain extensions that fit sites into nice categories would be the most popular. But instead, the current top 10 is an interesting collection of professional, generic and non-Latin TLDs. We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email&quot;&gt;.EMAIL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&quot;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&quot;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&quot;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company&quot;&gt;.COMPANY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&quot;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to keep in mind though when looking at the current top 10. For one, these gTLDs are still very new, so we don&amp;#39;t really know what will happen once the general public catches on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the current numbers are skewed by registries parking domains themselves. From Andrew Allemann - &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/04/16/uniregistry-activates-thousands-of-reserved-domains-per-tld/&quot;&gt;Domain Name Wire&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Uniregistry activated its reserved domain names in top level domains that have launched so far, massively increasing the size of its zones. It accounts for basically all of the growth in .sexy and .tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by some quick checks, it appears that the majority of domains in .link, which just launched with 20,000+ domains in the zone file, are actually domains reserved by the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take these numbers as a grain of salt, but don&amp;#39;t discount the general popularity of the new TLDs as a whole. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; 638,083 new gTLDs registered, and many of the most promising extensions aren&amp;#39;t even launched yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;! It&amp;#39;d be great to see New Zealand&amp;#39;s funky new domain extension sneak onto next month&amp;#39;s list. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A practical look at using iwantmyname&#39;s two-factor authentication</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, making your online self more secure seems like a no-brainer. Of course you don&amp;#39;t want to get hacked. Of course you don&amp;#39;t want your identity to be stolen. But at what length are you willing to go to ensure your safety?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One easy (and totally free) step we recommend you take for every platform that supports it is two-factor authentication (2FA). Stripping technical jargon, 2FA basically makes it so that in order to login to your account, you have to type in a code that&amp;#39;s only accessable on your phone. So if Hacker X tries to access your account, they&amp;#39;ll need the code sitting on your phone to get through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something we think is really important, so here&amp;#39;s a quick look at how to set it up, and what using it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login to your account, then select &amp;quot;Login &amp;amp; Security&amp;quot; under the &amp;quot;Account&amp;quot; dropdown menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &amp;quot;Two-step verification&amp;quot; type in your phone number and country code, then download the Authy app for iOS or Android (an SMS text option is available if you&amp;#39;re on an unsupported platform).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-01-2fa-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;2FA setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using 2FA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;re all setup, your login will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-01-authy-login.png&quot; alt=&quot;Authy login&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just open up your Authy app (or SMS text) and type in the code provided—and that&amp;#39;s it. You&amp;#39;ve quickly—and painlessly—added a second level of security to your iwantmyname account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-05-01-2fa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Authy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;But will this get annoying?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The million dollar question. Yes, adding 2FA will make logging into your iwantmyname account a touch more cumbersome, but we&amp;#39;re not a Bitcoin platform you&amp;#39;re logging into every day. If you&amp;#39;re like me, you probably only mess with your account once a month—or less. And at five seconds per login (the Authy codes expires every 20 seconds, so even if you&amp;#39;re slow, it can only take that long), you&amp;#39;re only looking at losing a few seconds of your life a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s a really small price to pay for peace of mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>This week&#39;s new top-level domains, including .AGENCY, .CHEAP and .KIWI</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuIWW9MYpac&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week in new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) is a strong bunch, including two popular Chinese extensions, some of the &amp;quot;bargain&amp;quot; variety and our local favorite, .KIWI. We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&quot;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bargains&quot;&gt;.BARGAINS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cheap&quot;&gt;.CHEAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-agency&quot;&gt;.AGENCY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-boutique&quot;&gt;.BOUTIQUE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-zone&quot;&gt;.ZONE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hooray for .KIWI!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 1st is &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt; day, and based on the pre-orders, it&amp;#39;s looking to be one of the biggest opening days for a gTLD on iwantmyname. If you want to show a little New Zealand love on the web, pre-orders for .KIWI are still open, so get your name on the list before the official launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Big Chinese gTLDs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a native English speaker, it&amp;#39;s hard for me to estimate the impact of non-Latin gTLDs, but it seems that many of them will do quite well. And yesterday&amp;#39;s launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&quot;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt; (translates to .online) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&quot;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; (translates to .chinesewebsite) was the biggest yet, with 33,012 and 17,537 registrations respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kevin Murphy - Domain Incite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are still extremely impressive numbers, and .在线 is still the biggest launch to date, surpassing the 31,645 with which .berlin ended its first day of GA a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gTLD is likely to end the day in third or fourth place in the new gTLD league table, depending on how .photography (with 33,489 names this morning) performed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;Discount&amp;quot; domains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure this will become more clear in the coming months, but I wonder what the public reaction to the &amp;quot;discount&amp;quot; TLDs will be. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bargains&quot;&gt;.BARGAINS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cheap&quot;&gt;.CHEAP&lt;/a&gt; are coming this week, and they&amp;#39;ll be competing with .CODES, .COUPON, .COUPONS, .DEAL, .DEALS and .SALE. I think we&amp;#39;ll see one of two things happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The certain flood of spammy discount sites (there are good ones, just not many) will cause people to reject these gTLDs for trust reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be so many TLDs in search results that people will just put on blinders and trust search results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.COM is soooo 2013&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital agencies spend vast amounts of time positioning themselves as thought leaders on the web, and judging by our pre-orders, it looks like moving to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-agency&quot;&gt;.AGENCY&lt;/a&gt; domain might be the big agency thought-leadership trend of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll end this with a question. Do you want to be the last agency in town with a .COM domain?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Do the new domain extensions make good domain hacks?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a definition. In short, a domain hack is a trick to use a top-level domain (TLD) as part of the word. So, instead of using WORD.COM, you&amp;#39;d use WO.RD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, domain hacks have been used with country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like .IO in rad.io and .ES in watch.es. And amongst the right crowd, they worked because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. If you use a short, common word/phrase like &amp;quot;radio,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s easy to remember. 
B. Even if you didn&amp;#39;t remember what the TLD is, you knew to put the dot before the last two letters, because aside from .COM and a few others like .INFO, all the domain extensions were two letters. So &amp;quot;radio&amp;quot; is rad.io and &amp;quot;watches&amp;quot; is watch.es.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you knew your audience was savvy enough to not automatically add .COM to the end of everything, domain hacks were great. But then came the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedomains.com/2014/04/20/how-many-letters-on-to-the-right-of-the-dot-is-too-many-to-be-a-hack/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; titled &amp;quot;How Many Letters On To The Right of the Dot is Too Many To Be A Hack? [sic],&amp;quot; The Domains listed domains like hollywoodreal.estate and palmbeachreal.estate as domain hacks and asked if they were too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me though, the question is not if they are too long, it&amp;#39;s that they may wreck the understanding internet users currently have. As I said earlier, the current understanding is that the dot will come directly before the last two letters of the word. But as a user, how do you navigate something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company name: iPhone Reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible domain hack 1: iphonerevie.ws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible domain hack 2: iphone.reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five letter TLDs, three letter TLDs—the introduction of anything other than two letters introduces doubt to the equation, and that&amp;#39;s tricky. Do you use .TIRES as a domain hack for something like chrisre.tires, when it could get confused with chrisretir.es? Will you ever be confident enough to know that any strange combination of letters isn&amp;#39;t a gTLD? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Expect to see far fewer domain hacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of getting lost in confusion, I think it&amp;#39;s important to think of why people used domain hacks in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from being cool, domain hacks opened up a whole new universe of possible TLDs to use (.ES, .IO, .IT). They let you break free from the clutches of .COM—which is exactly what the hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; are intending to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, instead of having to explain a ccTLD domain hack to someone, you can probably just replace it with a gTLD. So this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;My email address is hello at Dave dot ventures.&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;My email address is hello at Daveventur dot es. That&amp;#39;s Daveventures with no dot com. Just put the dot before the ES.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these new namespaces now open, I think we&amp;#39;ll see far fewer domain hacks in the future. You&amp;#39;ll still see them here and there because they&amp;#39;re fairly fun to dream up (chrisre.tires was a pretty good one, if maybe a few decades premature), but the necessity seems to be coming to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Does your domain name have a sketchy past?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pretend your website is a child, and it&amp;#39;s your sole responsibility to name it. Technically, you could name it anything you want, but like all things, names come with connotations. You probably don&amp;#39;t want to name your child after the scam artist next door. And you certainly don&amp;#39;t want to name it after a village plunderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do your research. Here&amp;#39;s a little video guide from Matt Cutts of Google Webmasters on how you can protect yourself from registering domain names with iffy histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-EdhaMDXho&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, here are his three three main tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a &amp;quot;site: DOMAINNAME.com&amp;quot; search. If you see anything fishy, be weary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for the domain name without the domain extension. So instead of &amp;quot;site: DOMAINNAME.com&amp;quot;, just search for &amp;quot;DOMAINNAME.&amp;quot; You never know what you might find. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for your desired domain on &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. If your site used to be a scam site, you could suffer a continued SEO hit. Also note that if your site used to be something you find unsavory, you may get residual unsavory emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Are .PINK, .RED and .BLUE lost in a kaleidoscope of domain extensions?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Afilias announced the start of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pink&quot;&gt;.PINK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-red&quot;&gt;.RED&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blue&quot;&gt;.BLUE&lt;/a&gt; sunrise periods, this is how .PINK was positioned (&lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/afilias-adds-color-choice-internet-192000232.html&quot;&gt;click over&lt;/a&gt; for .BLUE and .RED):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.PINK addresses embrace a wide range of uses, from the lighthearted fun of baby furnishings and toys to the simmering sensuality of lingerie products to the compassion and courage of cancer caregivers and patients. Young women — and men — of all ages love the optimism of .PINK and can now have a business or personal name that expresses their “pink-itude.” Finally, you can show the world that you “Think .PINK!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m definitely a proponent of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), but from the start, I wondered how popular color TLDs will be in the long run (the first day was pretty rough). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, the vast majority of the gTLDs fit nicely into these three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They help you fit in, like .COM. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They align with your brand, like .PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They define you, like .GURU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But .PINK, .RED and .BLUE? Looking at the marketing message above, they don&amp;#39;t seem to have a clear definition, and they certainly don&amp;#39;t directly categorize many brands (although they&amp;#39;ll probably get a few registrations from Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret&amp;#39;s PINK line). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Andrew Allemann of Domain Name Wire &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/04/18/afilias-new-top-level-domain-names-have-very-slow-first-day/&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;I would think for one of the color domains to take off they’ll need to get a few key celebrities, star brands, or startups on board. They’ll have to make the domains mean something when they don’t mean much on their own.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I have seen is color TLDs being used for domain hacks—particularly with .RED. A quick search on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scrabblefinder.com/ends-with/red/&quot;&gt;Scrabble Word Finder&lt;/a&gt; brings up a ton of great ideas, including bo.red, tou.red, admi.red and acqui.red. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that even without a traditional use case, these domain extensions do a lot right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each are commonly used, easily remembered words &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are short, so you&amp;#39;ll likely avoid spelling errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of these TLDs would ever be confused with another, like .PHOTO and .PHOTOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will .PINK, .RED and .BLUE be popular in the long run? I guess we&amp;#39;ll see. There&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/tld&quot;&gt;not much buzz&lt;/a&gt; around these color TLDs yet, but there&amp;#39;s not exactly a time limit for domain extension popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>May 1st is .KIWI day</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Like little online children, we love each generic top-level domain (gTLD) the same. .GURU, .RED, .PHOTOGRAPHY—all are lovely in their own special way. But if we were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one, we&amp;#39;d choose .KIWI, New Zealand&amp;#39;s choicest new domain extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuIWW9MYpac&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 1st, .KIWI is set to launch, and we&amp;#39;re really hoping it takes off with local businesses and bloggers. Because...well...we&amp;#39;ll finally have a TLD that&amp;#39;s as unique and quirky as we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go on—&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;pre-orders&lt;/a&gt; are only open for a while longer. Make sure you&amp;#39;re ready when .KIWI takes off!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Peter Orum on why he chose .PICS for his photography website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, my main web project has been founding a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paintingsilove.com&quot;&gt;social networking site&lt;/a&gt; for artists to comment on each other’s paintings.  However, I have recently resumed taking black and white street photography after a long break, and I’d like to establish and promote a personal site for my photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the iwantmyname &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/which-photography-gtld-should-you-use.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, there are a range of different gTLDs to use for photography, including .GALLERY, .PHOTO, .PHOTOS, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .PICS &amp;amp; .PICTURES. When I found that the .PHOTOGRAPHY domain extension was available, I tried to grab street.photography, but it was already taken. So in trying to get something as close/relevant to that as possible, I was able to get streetbw.photography. As I really wanted something starting with just &amp;#39;street,&amp;#39; I also pre-ordered ‘street’ with some of the other gTLDs, just on the off-chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, after using the domain streetbw.photography for a couple of months, I found it quite cumbersome to tell someone verbally, always having to spell it out and explain it. And my wife could never remember it. So after reading the above-mentioned blog entry, it struck me that this domain just wasn’t going to work for me, and I decided to switch to something shorter with my name, such as street.peterorum.com, or even bw.peterorum.com. But luckily, the same day I found that I&amp;#39;d won &lt;a href=&quot;http://street.pics/&quot;&gt;street.pics&lt;/a&gt;, and I was quite excited about it because it’s short, memorable, descriptive and generic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal photography sites, I think the .PICS and .PHOTOS domains are the way to go. If I had a photography business that needed branding though, I would probably choose .PHOTOGRAPHY with my name, or perhaps with my surname so my first name could be a subdomain, e.g. peter.orum.photography. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever of the new gTLDs you choose, make sure that the www prefix also works (using a CNAME), as many people still type that in by default, and some editors don&amp;#39;t automatically set the straight domain as a link yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Any non-.COM anxiety?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a non-.COM wasn’t a cause for concern for my personal site. I already have my name, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peterorum.com&quot;&gt;peterorum.com&lt;/a&gt;, and other attractive .COM domains are long gone. Discoverability these days is not so much about your domain, but rather having good content, a responsive site for mobile and good promotion. It&amp;#39;s also important to get a Google+ profile to link to your site so you are verified as the site author to generate trust. And, for photography, you can promote your work on other sites such as Flickr, Instragram and Twitter, with your site linked through your profile. Because of this visual exposure, an interesting, descriptive, short and memorable domain may be more important than a less memorable one that just aims to show up in Google via domain keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m happy to have street.pics as it seems to suit my purposes best from the available options. Definitely now is the time to be trying to get your first choices, even if it means buying a few and trying them out for a few months until you find the one that works best. Just don’t forget to use the appropriate redirection codes, and notify Google Webmaster Tools if changing so you don’t lose what you have built up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good.luck&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>NPR&#39;s Planet Money explains the new top-level domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit of a rabid podcast listener, and like any fan of a given medium, I have lots of opinions. I like Downcast more than any other podcast app, I like story driven shows over freeform conversations, and I really love NPR&amp;#39;s Planet Money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this week&amp;#39;s Planet Money, titled &amp;quot;The Wild West Of The Internet,&amp;quot; was right up my alley:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 100 million websites ending in .com. But new options for website names are becoming available. Not only is there .com and .gov .edu, but now .ninja has been added. Also .bike, .plumbing and .cool. In all, over 1,000 new top-level domains, as they are called, will be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today on the show, what happens when you just create a whole bunch of real estate out of nowhere? We meet some of the new land barons with big dreams. And a guy who worries it&amp;#39;s just going to be a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a fan of the show, or just want to get a better grasp on what&amp;#39;s going on with these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/04/16/303735386/episode-532-the-wild-west-of-the-internet&quot;&gt;give this episode a listen&lt;/a&gt;. I think you&amp;#39;ll enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Which photography domain extension should you use?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you give a creative person too many ways to solve a relatively simple problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you firsthand. Panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were announced a few years back, my hope was that they would all fit into tidy categories. Of course there wouldn&amp;#39;t be any overlapping TLDs—that would be madness. Absolute madness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, skip to today and check out my own personal nightmare. Instead of fitting a brand name to a catch-all gTLD, we have &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; good gTLDs for the photography category (and plenty more in close orbit, like .CAM and .CAMERA). We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery&quot;&gt;.GALLERY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&quot;&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos&quot;&gt;.PHOTOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&quot;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pictures&quot;&gt;.PICTURES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So which one should a photographer choose? And what should people be thinking about when choosing one over another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thought 1: Do TLD lengths matter?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general rule is that Google penalizes any domain longer than 63 characters, but even a long TLD like .PHOTOGRAPHY should put you well under that limit. So there&amp;#39;s probably not any SEO difference as far as length goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One definite strike against .PHOTOGRAPHY though is that it opens people up to spelling errors, particularly on mobile devices. I&amp;#39;ve heard enough complaints about &amp;quot;fat fingers&amp;quot; since the launch of the iPhone to know that less characters is probably better for touch screens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if your brand currently uses the &lt;em&gt;YOURNAME Photography&lt;/em&gt; naming convention, yourname.photography is certainly shorter than yournamephotography.com. And it&amp;#39;s certainly more accurate than YOURNAME.photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the short answer here is yes, TLD length probably does matter, but not enough to create a hard rule. Unless the rule is that you shouldn&amp;#39;t choose brevity over accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thought 2: Are keywords important?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engine optimization (SEO) is tricky because the guidelines change with every search engine update, but it&amp;#39;s commonly accepted that having a descriptive domain can help search results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone did a search for &amp;quot;New Zealand garden pictures,&amp;quot; newzealandgarden.pictures would likely rank well. Or if you were going after a younger audience, perhaps newzealandhipstergarden.pics would work (although I&amp;#39;d hate typing that into my iPhone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t get too excited about keyword stuffing—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/webmaster/archive/2014/01/15/domain-name-importance-in-ranking.aspx&quot;&gt;according to Duane Forrester, Sr. Product Manager of Bing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking today is a result of so many signals fed into the system the words used in a domain send less and less information into the stack as a percentage of overall decision making signals. This is great from our view (the engine) as it results in better results showing at the top since no one signal can be manipulated. From the searchers POV, it’s better simply because those sites trying to abuse their way to the top with a keyword rich domain and irrelevant or poor content cease to rank well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he finishes his thought quite well with a simple tip, &amp;quot;Good domain names are easy to remember, easy to spell, easy to pronounce and often short.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are keywords important? Probably so, but you can&amp;#39;t con search engines like you could a decade ago. Your best bet here is to try to work terms that rank highest into your brand name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a thought exercise, I did a quick keyword search in Google AdWords and found that &amp;quot;photography&amp;quot; gets 135,000 avg. monthly searches, while &amp;quot;photo&amp;quot; only gets 60,500. Keep things like that in mind when choosing your domain/brand name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thought 3: Which is more memorable?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re getting pretty subjective here, but memorability is probably the most important factor when choosing a TLD. Here are the three rules I&amp;#39;d try to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated above, if people know your brand as &lt;em&gt;YOURNAME Photography&lt;/em&gt;, go with yourname.photography. It&amp;#39;s a bit longer than the other gTLD options, but takes no thought for your customers to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have an established name yet, try to stick to the shortest TLD that makes sense. So, .PHOTO over .PHOTOS and .PICS over .PICTURES (although you could argue that &amp;quot;pictures&amp;quot; gets nearly five times more monthly searches than &amp;quot;pics&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go with what&amp;#39;s popular, and right now, .PHOTOGRAPHY is the third most popular new gTLD out there. That could certainly change in the coming months, but if the photography world gravitates to a single TLD, I&amp;#39;d certainly consider riding that wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thought 4: Should you just use a .COM?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The million dollar question. If you&amp;#39;re still on the fence about using a new gTLD, I&amp;#39;d recommend taking a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/whats-in-a-name-the-case-for-gtlds.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I would recommend using a .COM if you can find your brand name on its own—like YOURNAME.com or BRANDNAME.com. In the likely event that your desired word, name or phrase is taken in the .COM namespace though, I&amp;#39;d recommend against adding a descriptive word to the domain, like YOURNAMEphotography.com or BRANDNAMEphotos.com. That just adds extra complexity and unnecessarily squishes keywords together. Instead, go with a gTLD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best:&lt;/strong&gt; yourbrand.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost as good:&lt;/strong&gt; yourbrand.photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meh:&lt;/strong&gt; yourbrandphotography.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s in a name? The case for the new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about the future of these new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), and no matter where my mind takes me, I always return to one question—what&amp;#39;s in a name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, what makes one TLD better than any other TLD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.COM, because it&amp;#39;s what people type automatically&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument for going with a .COM domain is a simple one. If you were to guess the website of a company, the first TLD you&amp;#39;d choose is .COM. And for the vast majority of websites out there, you&amp;#39;d be right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexa.com/topsites&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s top 10 sites on the web:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Google.com
&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook.com
&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Youtube.com
&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Yahoo.com
&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Baidu.com
&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Wikipedia.org
&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; Qq.com
&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; Twitter.com
&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; Live.com
&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; Linkedin.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one non-.COM, and it comes in the form of wikipedia.org, which happens to be the one of the largest, most ambitious encyclopedias known to man. But even Wikipedia began as a .COM, only switching to .ORG to make a stance agains commercial advertising (the .COM now redirects to .ORG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The local ccTLD always works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For businesses outside the US, a popular choice is to go with the local country code top-level domain (ccTLD). Looking further down the Alexa list, you&amp;#39;ll see plenty of localized options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13.&lt;/strong&gt; Google.co.in
&lt;strong&gt;14.&lt;/strong&gt; Sina.com.cn
&lt;strong&gt;19.&lt;/strong&gt; Yahoo.co.jp
&lt;strong&gt;21.&lt;/strong&gt; Yandex.ru
&lt;strong&gt;24.&lt;/strong&gt; Google.de&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side benefit is that by stepping outside the .COM namespace, you open your brand to a world of domains not available in the crowded .COM namespace. Just look at local Wellington, NZ favorite, Flight Coffee. Instead of buying flightcoffee.com in the aftermarket, they use flightcoffee.co.nz—and it makes total sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where do the gTLDs fit in?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single biggest factor when choosing a domain is visibility. And truth is, in 2014, your best bet for making sure your domain is visible is to go with .COM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really, how firmly entrenched are we in this .COM standard? In the early 90&amp;#39;s, .COM barely existed, and was still being maintained by the National Science Foundation. And it really wasn&amp;#39;t until the .COM boom of the late 90&amp;#39;s that we thought of .COM as being synonymous with the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even crazier is the fact that today, less than half the world&amp;#39;s population is connected. In the next 20 years, we could literally see &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of people get online for the first time, and they&amp;#39;ll be using the internet much like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need directions to Flight Coffee? Type &lt;em&gt;directions to Flight Coffee&lt;/em&gt; into the omnibar, then click the link you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you try to guess between flightcoffee.com, flightcoffee.co.nz and a new gTLD like flight.coffee  to find directions if a quick search could deliver better, more relevant results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And much like the web itself, we&amp;#39;re only at the infancy of search. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This is where SEO comes in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, search results will be even more personalized, blending together your location, interests, past sites visited, types of sites you typically read, and a slew of data points not even available yet. (Maybe your blood pressure or the weather will alter your search results someday?) And if Google goes far enough to eliminate the need for manual domain entry, the primary objective for naming sites will move from manual discoverability to SEO (search engine optimization). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good tidbit about SEO and gTLDs from Bill Hartzer - &lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com/ugc/an-seos-guide-to-acquiring-new-gtlds&quot;&gt;Moz.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were selling track shoes online, then there are several options here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;www.trackshoes.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;www.track.shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;www.yourbrand.com/trackshoes/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, one of the most valued ranking factors is still links. And I personally believe that it will be a long time (perhaps at least several years) until links are de-valued as a search engine ranking factor (if they&amp;#39;re ever de-valued). If you were getting links, which domain name or URL would you want to use? Personally, just by looking at that list above, I&amp;#39;d like to build links to www.track.shoes since each keyword is technically &amp;quot;separated&amp;quot; and doesn&amp;#39;t run together. As you look at track.shoes and trackshoes.com domain names, there&amp;#39;s a better chance that you would get a &amp;quot;keyword&amp;quot; anchor text link directly to the home page. This is the same reason why we tend to see companies rank for their company name: most of the links pointing to their website include the company name (the keyword) and it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize that thought, his recommendation is to use gTLDs as a method to separate keywords, as opposed to mashing them together behind a .COM TLD. And in a world where most simple .COM names are taken, gTLDs give brands a wonderful opportunity to isolate their natural name from their qualifier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the example states, the brand &lt;em&gt;Track&lt;/em&gt; could now register Track.shoes and keep their brand name whole as opposed to using Trackshoes.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The main takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a scary new world out there, with hundreds of TLDs to choose from, but you probably need to worry a lot less than you currently might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember this—when choosing a domain, your best option is probably the YOURBRAND.com naming convention. But if you&amp;#39;re finding yourself settling with something like YOURBRANDcoffee or YOURBRANDshoes.com, it might be best to look &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Heartbleed aftermath</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you likely know, we are now coming to understand the full implications of the OpenSSL vulnerability (aka the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://heartbleed.com/&quot;&gt;Heartbleed bug&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;) that was disclosed last week. &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1354/&quot;&gt;Here is an excellent graphical explanation of the vulnerability.&lt;/a&gt; New angles of attack against vulnerable infrastructure come up every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Have you patched your home router and updated your passwords after &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartbleed.com/&quot;&gt;checking sites for vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we patched all servers the day the vulnerability was disclosed. However, we also did more. Read on for more in-depth information on how we handle our security, and recommendations for our customers on managing their accounts and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iwantmyname infrastructure is split up into several layers, and the front-facing application server actually has very little data in memory. Most of our processing happens in backend servers that are not directly exposed and have had no vulnerable services running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure none of our front-facing certificates are used in unintended ways we took the time to get new EV certificates for iwantmyname and revoked the old certs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learnings from this incident include the age-old mantra of &amp;quot;change your passwords frequently&amp;quot; and consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification&quot;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; (2fa) where appropriate. We support 2fa at iwantmyname, together with other risk mitigation technologies to make sure your account will not get compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it comes down to your personal password &amp;quot;hygiene&amp;quot; to make sure your passwords are unique, frequently updated and securely stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using a password manager that is both secure by design and proactive about security risks. We like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keepassx.org/&quot;&gt;KeepassX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/1password&quot;&gt;1password&lt;/a&gt;. Both are secure password storage mechanisms. If you want to roll your own password storage, make sure you use PGP/GPG to secure your passwords, and that your private keys are secured properly and long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last initiative we are currently working on is a complete disaster escalation plan. Similar to the zombie apocalypse plans some cities and organizations have prepared, this helps us to have a well-organized and communicated plan in place so everyone knows exactly what to do. This time around we were able to lock everything down very quickly, but who knows what the next bug will look like. Software is written by humans after all.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Next week is the biggest yet for new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally don&amp;#39;t like to overhype things, but the sheer volume of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out next week is a big deal. Over the course of three days (April 15-17), 14 domain extensions will be going live, and a few of them are likely to be quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the full list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 15&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-buzz&quot;&gt;.BUZZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gift&quot;&gt;.GIFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guitars&quot;&gt;.GUITARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&quot;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&quot;&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&quot;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 16&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holiday&quot;&gt;.HOLIDAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-marketing&quot;&gt;.MARKETING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 17&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blue&quot;&gt;.BLUE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kim&quot;&gt;.KIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pink&quot;&gt;.PINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-red&quot;&gt;.RED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shiksha&quot;&gt;.SHIKSHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8&quot;&gt;.移动&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, pre-orders will be open until the launch date given, so there&amp;#39;s still time to get your domains on the list. Also, in case you missed it &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/new-useful-page-the-gtld-launch-calendar.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ve added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&quot;&gt;new page to the site&lt;/a&gt; that lists all the gTLDs with known launch dates and prices. We&amp;#39;ll still continue to periodically highlight these gTLDs in the blog, but if you ever need instant information, you now know where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Microsoft ends free email for custom domains. Here are 5 alternatives.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As reported by ZDNet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-ends-support-for-custom-domains-in-free-email-service-7000028306/?s_cid=e589&amp;amp;ttag=e589&amp;amp;ftag=TREc64629f&quot;&gt;Microsoft ends support for custom domains in free email service&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mike Schackwitz, Principal Group Program Manager for the Outlook.com service, Microsoft will “wind down the Custom Domains product” while continuing to support existing custom email addresses “indefinitely.” The service has been in existence since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the good news is that existing accounts will remain active. However, if you were used to setting up your iwantmyname domains using Microsoft&amp;#39;s email hosting service, you now need a new tool in your online toolbelt. Our own Chris Hall wrote a neat article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&quot;&gt;how to get a custom email address&lt;/a&gt; last year, which lists several alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite&quot;&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain&quot;&gt;Fastmail.FM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/rackspace-apps&quot;&gt;Rackspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding&quot;&gt;Pobox.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoho Mail is the only one still offering free accounts, but we all know that this might change eventually. If you&amp;#39;re not a fan of Google, we found FastMail a great alternative and Pobox will certainly do the trick for email forwarding only.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New useful page: The gTLD launch calendar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;big list&lt;/a&gt;. And we were quite pleased with our big list, but it needed more context. So we built categories and buckets for released and about-to-be-released gTLDs—and it worked out great. But one more thing was needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a way to show all the gTLD launch information we know, and we needed it to update automatically so it wouldn&amp;#39;t require insane amounts of time to manually maintain. So we built it, and we&amp;#39;re really happy with how it turned out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say hi to our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&quot;&gt;gTLD launch calendar&lt;/a&gt;. It has launch dates and prices for all the gTLDs we have information on, and it&amp;#39;s quite easy on the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders for all listed gTLDs are open until the launch date given, so get your domain on the list before it&amp;#39;s open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Find a full-bodied domain extension for your craft beverage site</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you travel in the world, there&amp;#39;s one cultural constant you can always count on—people take their beverages very seriously. Whether it&amp;#39;s coffee, beer, wine, vodka or drinks made of animal parts, there&amp;#39;s always something you need to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, with the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), drink makers can tap into this liquid love with domain names categorized for their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;. COFFEE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quartz posted an eye-opening &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/166983/where-the-worlds-biggest-coffee-drinkers-live/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; (excuse the pun) back in January about coffee consumption around the world—specifically about how much more coffee Northern Europe drinks than the US, UK, France, Spain and Italy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As surprising as it was though to find that the Netherlands consumes 2.414 cups of coffee a day (compared to .939 cups in New Zealand and .931 cups in the US), the most interesting stat to me was that people in nearly every country drink coffee daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, just imagine how many coffee shops there must be. And how many coffee roasters there are delivering beans to markets and restaurants. Now take that one step further and imagine how many coffee-related sites there are on the web. The number must be insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the .COFFEE TLD has quite a bit of room to grow. Of the Donuts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donuts.co/tlds/&quot;&gt;mega-list of gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;, this one may be the biggest (maybe even bigger than the surprise hit, .GURU?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&quot;&gt;.COFFEE&lt;/a&gt; is now open to the public, so hurry up an grab your domain before someone else does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.BEER and .WINE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more loved than coffee, beer and wine are arguably the most important beverages in human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/opinion/sunday/how-beer-gave-us-civilization.html&quot;&gt;From Jeffrey Kahn - New York Times:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the effects of these early brews were discovered, the value of beer (as well as wine and other fermented potions) must have become immediately apparent. With the help of the new psychopharmacological brew, humans could quell the angst of defying those herd instincts. Conversations around the campfire, no doubt, took on a new dimension: the painfully shy, their angst suddenly quelled, could now speak their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the alcohol would have had more far-ranging effects, too, reducing the strong herd instincts to maintain a rigid social structure. In time, humans became more expansive in their thinking, as well as more collaborative and creative. A night of modest tippling may have ushered in these feelings of freedom — though, the morning after, instincts to conform and submit would have kicked back in to restore the social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, beer and wine serve much the same purpose, and because of their popularity, have developed online ecosystems that go far beyond the major brands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microbreweries, vineyards, distributors, stores, home-brew sites, review blogs and drink-centric magazines—all competing for the same namespaces. We expect to see a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&quot;&gt;.BEER&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wine&quot;&gt;.WINE&lt;/a&gt; domains popping up once the TLDs go live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders are open now for both domain extensions, and keep checking our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&quot;&gt;gTLD launch page&lt;/a&gt; for upcoming launch details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.VODKA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The king of the clears, vodka is the only &amp;quot;hard alcohol&amp;quot; set to launch as a gTLD. And vodka stats are about as unsurprising as they come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/179708/map-where-the-worlds-biggest-vodka-drinkers-are/&quot;&gt;From Roberto A Ferdman - Quartz:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one downs vodka like Russia does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians drink some 17.3 shots of vodka per month on average, according to data from Euromonitor. That’s easily the most in the world. The Polish, the second biggest vodka drinkers in Euromonitor’s sample, throw back about 13.7 shots per month; while Ukrainians drink roughly 10 shots per month. Americans come in at only 3.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As popular as vodka is, it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how its comparatively small ecosystem works out for the .VODKA TLD. Don&amp;#39;t be surprised if it&amp;#39;s much less popular than the drink TLDs listed above, but that could play into your advantage if you have a great .VODKA domain in mind. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vodka&quot;&gt;Pre-orders&lt;/a&gt; are open now, and we&amp;#39;ll be sure to pass on additional news once launch dates are set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The surrounding ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, these new gTLDs would be used as hard categories for brands to funnel themselves into, but that&amp;#39;s probably not a realistic dream. .COM will be a big player for the foreseeable future, country code top-level domains will always be relevant in their respective countries, and even some non-beverage gTLDs will crossover into the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you were starting a coffee blog, would you go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-com&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, .COFFEE or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&quot;&gt;.BLOG&lt;/a&gt;? And would you choose .BEER or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-organic&quot;&gt;.ORGANIC&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming line of organic beers (yes, they do exist)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way you look at it, these new gTLDs are giving site owners a vast selection of great domains to choose from. So love your beverage sites, and have fun finding the perfect domain for your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Heartbleed OpenSSL security bug</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5593654/heartbleed-explainer-big-new-web-security-flaw-compromise-privacy&quot;&gt;The Heartbleed Bug, explained — Vox:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was big news in the computer security world yesterday when researchers announced a massive vulnerability in popular web encryption software called OpenSSL. Major online service providers are scrambling to address the problem. What happened? And how does it affect you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Our software was patched shortly after the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This week in gTLDs, including .COFFEE, .FLORIST and .HOUSE</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any rhyme or reason to it, but it seems like each week&amp;#39;s batch of new TLDs has a theme. Two weeks ago we had a group of gTLDs with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/this-week-in-gtlds-is-rigged-up-for-the-it-crowd-plus-some-thoughts-on-email.html&quot;&gt;IT theme&lt;/a&gt;. Last week we had a group of education-themed extensions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-education&quot;&gt;.EDUCATION&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-institute&quot;&gt;.INSTITUTE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-camp&quot;&gt;.CAMP&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this week? I&amp;#39;m calling this the week of cozy spring mornings. We have: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&quot;&gt;.COFFEE&lt;/a&gt;, to help you wake up and enjoy the crisp, sunny weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-florist&quot;&gt;.FLORIST&lt;/a&gt;, the perfect TLD for finding a bouquet of newly bloomed flowers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-solar&quot;&gt;.SOLAR&lt;/a&gt;, for turning the warmth of the sun into energy (to power your coffee grinder, of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-house&quot;&gt;.HOUSE&lt;/a&gt;, the place where all the spring cleaning happens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-international&quot;&gt;.INTERNATIONAL&lt;/a&gt;, for planning that perfect spring break trip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last day for pre-orders, so get your domain name in before these TLDs go public on April 9th at 16:00 UTC. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>End the domain-finding confusion with .COFFEE</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up at 7:45 AM and—in zombielike fashion—walked directly to my coffee setup. It was fairly calculated this morning, with 45 grams of a delicious Kenyan roast and 650 grams of 205-degree water poured carefully into my trusty Chemex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People close to me think I&amp;#39;m a bit neurotic about my coffee, but it&amp;#39;s important to me. It&amp;#39;s a hobby, a social scene and something to look forward to every morning—all wrapped up in a warm, brown liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And next week, my hobby and job are colliding. .COFFEE is set to launch on April 9th, and I think a lot of coffee shops, suppliers and blogs would do well to take notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What .COFFEE can do for you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to do a Google search every time I wanted to go to a website. For example, one of my favorite roasters is Heart in Portland, OR, but finding the coffee shop/roaster online (without Google) initially took a bit of guesswork. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find the site at heart.com or heartcoffee.com—it took a Google search to find the site at heartroasters.com. Compounding the confusion, similar shops like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia are using the BRANDNAMEcoffee.com naming convention as opposed to BRANDNAMEroasters.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;#39;m so used to searching for things that it doesn&amp;#39;t bother me much, but I do miss the days when I could just type in BRANDNAME.com and expect results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think of this as a kind of reset for the web. A way for coffee shops with simple words like &amp;quot;Heart&amp;quot; to grab domains I can guess on the first try. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that sound nice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&quot;&gt;Pre-orders are open&lt;/a&gt; for another week, so grab one for your shop or blog today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Silvrback 2.0 is out, adds more polish and features</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit of a sucker for clean, utilitarian blog platforms, and Silvrback is definitely one of my current favorites. The concept is simple—you write what you want in the Markdown editor, then post. No widgets or distractions—just beautiful, beautiful simplicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it&amp;#39;s even better. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsowers.silvrback.com/welcome-to-silvrback-2&quot;&gt;From Damian Sowers - Silvrback:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m proud to announce the release of Silvrback 2.0! There are numerous changes to the whole platform. I&amp;#39;d like to thank all of the existing Silvrback users out there who have been giving me valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the announcement page for all the details, but 2.0 has a new UI scheme that changes &amp;quot;both your front-end blog and the back-end editing platform (and some other pages like your bio admin),&amp;quot; gives you full-page cover photo support, iframe embeds and a ton more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to give silvrback a shot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/silvrback-custom-domain&quot;&gt;grab a domain name&lt;/a&gt; and head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silvrback.com/&quot;&gt;silvrback.com&lt;/a&gt; to start your 14-day free trial.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Interesting stats in the latest DomainWire Domain Name Stat Report</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CENTR (Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries) released their latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://centr.org/system/files/share/domainwire_stat_report_2014_1.pdf&quot;&gt;DomainWire Stat Report&lt;/a&gt; today, delivering a wide range of stats related to ccTLD growth and overall size. Some of the information didn&amp;#39;t come as much of a surprise, such as .CN (China) being the fastest-growing ccTLD of the quarter (with 1.3 billion people, you&amp;#39;re bound to have some demand), but much of it was quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;#39;s all in a name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lines for countries were originally drawn, their corresponding ccTLDs were probably not considered. But how lucky was Montenegro to get stuck with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per 100 people in the country, 114 .ME domain names have been registered. That&amp;#39;s more than a domain for every single person in the country. But even that is dwarfed by Liechtenstein&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/li-liechtensteiner-domain-name-registration-for-liechtenstein&quot;&gt;.LI&lt;/a&gt; ccTLD. For every 100 people in Liechtenstein, 173 .LI domains are sold. Only 37,000 people reside in the country, but it&amp;#39;s an impressive stat nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Non-Latin characters are being used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent CENTR survey, in which 21 European ccTLDs said they offer IDNs showed that as at December 2013, there were total of 1.2 million domain names in Europe containing at least one non-Latin character - this represents around 6% of the domains in these ccTLDs. Compared to 6 months prior, the number of IDN domains in these ccTLDs grew with 17%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once non-Latin gTLDs start gaining traction, I think site owners will be much more likely to use non-Latin characters all over the web. This 1.2 million domain name stat could be quite a bit higher this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Germany leads Europe (and most of the world)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 15.7 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt; domains, Germany leads all of Europe in ccTLD registrations. The list drops off quickly after Germany though, with .UK having 10.6 million domains and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&quot;&gt;.NL&lt;/a&gt; (Netherlands) having 5.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even Germany is dwarfed by the tiny islands of Tokelau and their .TK domain. 22.2 million domains have been registered with the .TK ccTLD, but the vast majority are likely hosted through .TKs free registration service (you can also fully own the domain for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau&quot;&gt;a price&lt;/a&gt;). Don&amp;#39;t get too excited though—there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dot.tk/en/doc_tcfree_v360.pdf&quot;&gt;strict rules&lt;/a&gt; in place. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Big Cartel has a fresh new guide to custom domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here at iwantmyname, we get quite a few questions a day about setting up custom domains on various platforms. And that&amp;#39;s quite understandable, because domain mapping is entirely foreign to most people (but is incredibly simple with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we find custom domain guides from web platforms that are clear, informative and easy on the eyes though, we love to point them out as an extra level of assistance in times of need. And today, Big Cartel rolled out a great field guide for custom domains, complete with simple instructions, some nifty explanations and a few solid recommendations for good registrars to go with (we&amp;#39;re super happy to be on the list).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bigcartel.com/post/80895648068/new-field-guide-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the announcement from the Big Cartel Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve launched a new guide to help walk you through the wonderful world of custom URLs. A custom domain takes your brand from yourstore.bigcartel.com to yourstore.com, creates a professional first impression, and is one of the best ways to stake your claim on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready to get started? Our latest field guide will give you specific tips on where to purchase your new domain, and the simplest way to connect it to your Big Cartel shop. All that’s really left is to enjoy the new home that you’ve made for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a Big Cartel user (or thinking about becoming one), check the new guide out &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.bigcartel.com/custom-domain/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;—it even has some handy tips for &amp;quot;picking a great custom domain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks for the mention, Big Cartel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting from Big Cartel is their new podcast (well, it&amp;#39;s nine-months-old now, but I just discovered it this week), The Art Show. If you&amp;#39;re into that sort of thing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-art-show/id659177604?mt=2&quot;&gt;give it a listen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Small businesses without a web presence are missing out</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadians spend more time online than any other country—45.6 hours per month—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cira.ca/factbook/2013/canada-online.html&quot;&gt;according to CIRA&lt;/a&gt;. So it&amp;#39;s not surprising that &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalnews.ca/news/1215210/small-businesses-need-to-expand-web-presence/&quot;&gt;three-quarters of Canadians research purchases online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is surprising, then, is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalnews.ca/news/1215210/small-businesses-need-to-expand-web-presence/&quot;&gt;as this article states&lt;/a&gt;, only 45.5 percent of Canadian small businesses are online. (41 percent have a website, specifically.) It&amp;#39;s safe to say even fewer have a mobile-friendly web presence, despite the explosion in smartphone popularity and mobile usage. And despite having nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2119.html&quot;&gt;ten times the population&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/429783/group/homepage/&quot;&gt;the stats in the United States are similar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a huge missed opportunity for businesses to showcase and educate potential customers about their products or services, and enable people to contact them. And that&amp;#39;s just the basics of how creating an online presence can benefit companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies should also consider investing resources in content like a blog or engaging with customers, prospects, and others via social media. These can be a boon for a company&amp;#39;s marketing and customer relations efforts. Companies can really show off their expertise and become trusted information sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a prospect isn&amp;#39;t ready to buy &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;, if a company has provided valuable information, that person is more likely to return when he/she is ready to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With social media, companies can engage directly and immediately with prospects and customers. They can answer questions, provide information, or address complaints right away. It&amp;#39;s a key customer satisfaction differentiator these days to be easy to contact in the ways your customers prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian businesses doing business online help keep dollars north of the border as well. Per the article, at present two of every three dollars spent by Canadians go to the US. (And don&amp;#39;t get us started on cross-border shipping...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .CA domain is an immediate indicator for those who prefer to shop locally with whom they&amp;#39;re doing business. Kind of like sewing a Canadian flag on your backpack, but for the Internet. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cira.ca/factbook/2013/the-global-net.html&quot;&gt;It&amp;#39;s the fourth fastest-growing domain extension.&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cira.ca/factbook/2013/ca-in-canada.html&quot;&gt;Canadians prefer doing business with .CA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if being online is so advantageous to Canadian businesses, why are less than half of them embracing these opportunities? Well, some people remain afraid of technology. They might think they need to have highly technical expertise to design and run a website, though this is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/&quot;&gt;There are many services available&lt;/a&gt; to help business owners get an attractive, informative site up and running quickly and easily—no coding necessary. Social, ecommerce and other features can be included as well with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration for businesses is the time and effort required to maintain a good web presence. Really, though, that depends on what the goals of having a website are, and the needs of customers and prospects. A website that mostly showcases products and services and provides contact information doesn&amp;#39;t need to change very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a business wants to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt;, though, it is important to update it regularly. The best way to keep your audience&amp;#39;s attention is for them to expect and look forward to hearing from you. Newsletters are a great tool to accomplish this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media presences like Twitter or Facebook also require regular activity. People have short attention spans online. If your business participates in social media, expect to respond to people quickly when they contact you via those channels. This is why it&amp;#39;s common for businesses to have staff to manage web and social efforts as the company grows. Then the business owners can focus on what they do best – growing and running a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So come on, Canadian businesses! Let&amp;#39;s give those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.com/shopping-online-united-kingdom-denmark-sweden-have-most-online-shoppers-charts-1426988&quot;&gt;British companies&lt;/a&gt; a run for their money online. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;Register your .CA domain today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Domains finds some good .EMAIL registrations, and also some sneaky ones</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/this-week-in-gtlds-is-rigged-up-for-the-it-crowd-plus-some-thoughts-on-email.html&quot;&gt;wrote a bit&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about use cases (or a potential lack thereof) for .EMAIL domains, but it looks like plenty of brands have snapped them up in the Sunrise period. Or so it seems...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/25/some-interesting-email-domain-registrations-the-dallas-cowboys-miss-again/&quot;&gt;From Michael Berkens - The Domains:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big company that missed on getting their .Email domain, is the car maker Bentley, that didn’t register the domain during email and the domain Bentley.email is owned by Bentley Art Gallery in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some political domain names were registered all under privacy including BarackObama.email, HillaryClinton.email,  RandPaul.email and Rushlimbaugh.email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course depending on use the registrant of those domains could easily lose them in a URS or UDRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll certainly have to do a follow-up post on UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy) in the coming days, but the gist is that trademark-based domain disputes can be taken to court if the trademark holder feels they have been wronged. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how ICANN puts it:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the policy, most types of trademark-based domain-name disputes must be resolved by agreement, court action, or arbitration before a registrar will cancel, suspend, or transfer a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you hear something like this, you just have to shake your head. Also from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/25/meet-the-1st-email-cybersquatter-grabs-up-espn-pepsi-starbucks-chevrolet-nfl-more/&quot;&gt;From Michael Berkens - The Domains:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help miss the registrations by a organization out of Los Alamitos, CA named Viva Las Vegas who wound up getting a great domain in LasVegas.email, but went after and got domain names matching some trademarked and well known companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list includes registrations like Boeing.email, CocaCola.email, Starbucks.email, and a few others. But honestly, I&amp;#39;m inclined to think that brands won&amp;#39;t care at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think of the above mention of Starbucks. What would motivate a company of their stature to move their company emails from @Starbucks.com to @Starbucks.email? The only reason I could see them taking notice would be if Viva Las Vegas started sending scam emails with Starbucks branding—but that would certainly end badly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scam emails could be great though: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear INTERNET USER,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently did a DNA study on Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz and found that you are his closest relative. And because he takes care of his family, we are sending you $5,000,000. All we need in return is your name, home address and social security number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love,
kash5000000@starbucks.email&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>This week in gTLDs is for the IT crowd. Plus some thoughts on .EMAIL</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s batch of gTLDs has a bit of a theme, made up of a handful of options any support/IT team can get on board with. We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-solutions&quot;&gt;.SOLUTIONS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-builders&quot;&gt;.BUILDERS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-training&quot;&gt;.TRAINING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-support&quot;&gt;.SUPPORT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email&quot;&gt;.EMAIL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course like any good Top-Level Domain, these gTLDs have a number of good uses—like Lego enthusiasts with .BUILDERS and sneaky henchman with tactical .SUPPORT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One gTLD I can&amp;#39;t quite wrap my head around though is .EMAIL. The way email addresses work is that the information after the @ is your overarching website URL. So, if my website was chris.com (it&amp;#39;s not), my email would be something like hello@chris.com. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, would the owner of chris.com want to register chris.email to act as a specified email domain, as opposed to just using hello@chris.com? When you hear &amp;quot;something at something dot something,&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t it implied that it&amp;#39;s an email address? And isn&amp;#39;t it easier for people to remember email addresses when they are attached to websites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a glimpse of what Donuts has in mind with the .EMAIL gTLD. From an interview on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prlog.org/12264400-this-weeks-featured-tld-is-email.html&quot;&gt;prlog.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DotAnything:&lt;/em&gt; How do you envision domains within the .Email TLD being used?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donuts, Inc.:&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;We leave this decision to the end-user registrant. This is a more specific TLD, so it&amp;#39;s clearly likely it can be used for e-mail services (Example: you may someday tell a friend that you could be contacted at mary@smith.email), but it could be used in other contexts as well -- perhaps someone is interested in rating e-mail services or displaying funny e-mails for entertainment. Surely there will be creative uses we haven&amp;#39;t anticipated.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how the public uses .EMAIL in the coming months. Obvious use cases don&amp;#39;t seem clear to me at the moment, but I&amp;#39;ve certainly been surprised in the past (I definitely didn&amp;#39;t foresee .GURU&amp;#39;s popularity). It&amp;#39;s always fun to see the internet expand in new and exciting ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in any of the five domains coming out this week, pre-orders are still open—but not for long. The official release is on March 26th at 16:00:00 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tumblr gets two-factor authentication</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://staff.tumblr.com/post/80583764030/the-smile-of-a-loved-one-your-childhood-blanket&quot;&gt;From Staff.Tumblr:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smile of a loved one. Your childhood blanket. A handsome bodyguard to take you in his arms. “Security” can mean a lot of things in this crazy life, but nothing says “security” like Tumblr’s two-factor authentication. It’s available as an option in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fsettings%2Faccount&quot;&gt;Settings page&lt;/a&gt; as of right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how you need two keys to launch a nuclear missile? Two-factor authentication works like that. One key is your password, the other key is your cellular phone, and you need both to access your Tumblr Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you want to be extra sure your Tumblog is secure—or anything on the web, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/friends-dont-let-friends-go-without-two-factor-authentication.html&quot;&gt;your data at iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;—turn on two-factor authentication whenever and wherever you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be safe out there everyone. And kudos to Tumblr for making their sites significantly more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>You are the web</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine you have an email account. Possibly several. You&amp;#39;ve probably forgotten how many social media accounts you have. Might even have a few websites. That&amp;#39;s pretty common. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm&quot;&gt;Over a third&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/&quot;&gt;world&amp;#39;s population&lt;/a&gt; is online these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you consider &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; a website? A web property? A network? Probably not. But that could change. Might be already. Our world is becoming ever more connected and networked, and the idea of people, tech, and the Internet itself all being separate entities is becoming an increasingly archaic one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data we create online isn&amp;#39;t just about our emailing and browsing habits anymore. It&amp;#39;s not even just about computers or mobile phones. Our digital systems can include our cars, our appliances, and things we wear. All of these things are becoming more connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already aggregating our data in some relatively minor ways. There are smartphone apps that enable you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/products/10-diagnostic-apps-and-devices-to-make-you-a-better-driver#slide-1&quot;&gt;interact with your car&amp;#39;s diagnostics&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure-nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/gps_app/&quot;&gt;tweet your Nike+ running progress&lt;/a&gt;. So it&amp;#39;s not hard to imagine this trend continuing to evolve – each of us becoming a network of sorts, a nexus for all of our connected devices and data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting our accounts to a single, central hub from which we manage activities and data is convenient. We can see everything in one place. And, perhaps more importantly, larger and disparate data sets brought together can be more useful when analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one person&amp;#39;s monitoring doesn&amp;#39;t constitute &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data&quot;&gt;Big Data&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; but, for example, if you&amp;#39;re a runner, looking at the metrics from all of your runs over several months will tell you a lot more about your progress than looking at the metrics for a couple of days. Now imagine combining your exercise data with the information about your diet over that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add in information about your health, mental state, stress levels, sleep patterns – the result is a pretty comprehensive view of how you&amp;#39;re doing. And the person is just one facet. Imagine the same type of scenario for your home. Information on utilities usage, and the ability to control things like the thermostat remotely (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nest.com/&quot;&gt;which you can already do&lt;/a&gt;). Security systems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nest.com/smoke-co-alarm/life-with-nest-protect/&quot;&gt;smoke alarms&lt;/a&gt; that automatically alert emergency services (again, these already exist). Even things like detecting water seepage around your house foundation or roof, a carbon monoxide leak, or a problem with your furnace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/540977/internet_things_internet_jawbone_/&quot;&gt;Wearables can communicate with your environment, too.&lt;/a&gt; The opportunities to correct problems before they get bigger, or just see opportunities to do things more efficiently over time, are considerable. Your entire family could be part of that data hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, will we display, manage, and analyze all of this information? Where will we keep it? An app? That doesn&amp;#39;t provide a sense of &amp;#39;address&amp;#39;, really. The standard website doesn&amp;#39;t seem to quite fit the bill, either. As much as we&amp;#39;re used to the ubiquitous &amp;#39;.com&amp;#39;, given that that actually refers to &amp;#39;commerce&amp;#39;, it makes much sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this is an area of great opportunity for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;the new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;. They describe vastly more things, places, and activities than &amp;#39;.com&amp;#39; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;other traditional gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;, and stretch our concepts of online &amp;#39;addresses&amp;#39; or what a web &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt; is. (Especially given how much of our data is stored in the cloud.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have very specific mental models of what .com / .net / .org mean. But much less so with .systems / .home / .works and the like. Not to mention that beyond the English language, there are plenty of culturally relevant terms and concepts that could be explored, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/uno-looks-to-unite-the-spanish-speaking-web-an-interview-with-desiree-boxberger.html&quot;&gt;.UNO for Spanish speakers&lt;/a&gt;. What could be a more centralized &amp;#39;address&amp;#39; for all your information than what translates as &amp;#39;.one&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping categories of my information tidy and centralized under my.home or my.car could be very handy. Or, if I wanted everything in one place, my.life. A lot of sci-fi and speculative fiction already places us in worlds where that sort of all-access data all the time culture is common place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other app or social network&amp;#39;s settings, how much of that data we would choose to share or make public would be up to each person to decide. And while it could be invaluable to our doctors, mechanics, or contractors, it will also require a robust understanding and application of security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what we think of as &amp;#39;online&amp;#39; and a &amp;#39;website&amp;#39;, or even &amp;#39;content&amp;#39;, is evolving. It will no longer just be a partial repository for some of our stuff, or a way to share cat pictures. As sensors become more accurate, devices more wearable, and reliable high-speed connections more ubiquitous, these things may become, to a considerable degree, a reflection of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who will you choose to be on that &amp;#39;net?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>There is internet history being made in Singapore</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://singapore49.icann.org/en/&quot;&gt;49th ICANN meeting&lt;/a&gt; officially started today and the community is back in Singapore where internet history was made when new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were approved in 2011. Coincidentally, Singapore was also the location of the first ever ICANN conference in 1999 so there couldn&amp;#39;t be a better place to get together again now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs are a reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always inspiring to see internet veterans like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker&quot;&gt;Steve Crocker&lt;/a&gt; talking about the early days when he was helping to define protocols for the ARPANET which developed into today&amp;#39;s internet as we know it. Or hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Postel&quot;&gt;Jon Postel&lt;/a&gt; managing the whole DNS on a little index card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more history being discussed and that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/16177-who-runs-the-internet-an-icann-49-primer&quot;&gt;who will run the internet&lt;/a&gt;. It was recently announced that the last legal vestige of US control will dissapear in 2015. This transition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://iana.org&quot;&gt;IANA&lt;/a&gt; (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) from American stewardship to the international community starts today. IANA is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources. The proposed international stewardship could be a multi-stakeholder solution with ICANN, W3C, regional internet registries like RIPE or ARIN, root operators, IETF, ccTLDs and others. This week&amp;#39;s discussions will be an important first step towards a truly global and open internet which should not be run by just one country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What else is happening?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New gTLDs are still a big topic—especially their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.icann.org/2014/03/the-tld-universal-acceptance-project/&quot;&gt;universal acceptance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on practical operational experience, not all systems (e.g. browsers, spam filters, registration databases, user profiles, ISPs, etc.) work seamlessly when new TLDs are added. Users may experience failures in resolution or other issues with newer TLDs, which in turn impacts consumer trust on the DNS. The issue of the Universal Acceptance of TLDs (Top-Level Domains) is critically related to the introduction of new gTLDs, as well as the introduction of IDN ccTLDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we pointed out in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/an-open-letter-to-web-platforms-about-gtld-adoption.html&quot;&gt;open letter to web platforms&lt;/a&gt;, there is still a lot of work to do. Companies like Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/twitter-is-now-supporting-most-of-the-gtlds.html&quot;&gt;have been catching up&lt;/a&gt; but browser support can still be patchy. We are looking forward to attendees from Mozilla, Google and Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;http://singapore49.icann.org/en/schedule/mon-tld-acceptance&quot;&gt;giving us an update on that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you at ICANN Singapore and would like to meet? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>250,000 new gTLDs have been registered, and .GURU is still at the top</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, as of writing this post, the internet is sitting with 294,066 new gTLDs. And considering the first TLDs only started being offered for general availability in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html&quot;&gt;early February&lt;/a&gt;, the public reception has been quite nice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not the steady growth that shocks me the most—it&amp;#39;s the top of the list of TLDs that are doing best. Here&amp;#39;s the current top 10 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;from ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many great gTLDs out now (and so many more coming), it&amp;#39;s hard to believe the sustained popularity of .GURU. Today, it makes up nearly 17% of all the new gTLDs on the web, and seems to be growing at a steady pace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like though that something will eventually overtake .GURU on the gTLD list. The question is, what will it be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&quot;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&quot;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&quot;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location-based gTLDs are going to be a big deal. .BERLIN, .NYC, .LONDON—expect to see a few of these extensions on or near the top 10 once they are public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&quot;&gt;.DIRECTORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.BIKE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land&quot;&gt;.LAND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Japanese IDNs, .コム and a .JP price reduction</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDN&amp;#39;s, or Internationalized Domain Names, are probably going to change the internet. No, they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; change the internet—it&amp;#39;s just hard to tell how much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without doing any sort of in-depth usability study, it&amp;#39;s easy to see why domains using international characters would be popular in foreign countries. The internet is supposed to be for us all, but it&amp;#39;s currently dominated by the latin alphabet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FmLnNDw23Y&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, just recently, Google launched its first Japanese IDN, .みんな (translated to &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot;), and it&amp;#39;s currently the 27th most popular gTLD on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ntldstats.com/&quot;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;. And soon, .コム will be coming, ironically giving Japanese speakers a transliteration of the web standard—.COM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Akram Atallah of ICANN said when announcing the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2013/10/dawn-of-a-new-internet-era/&quot;&gt;Dawn of a New Internet Era&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more of the world’s developing countries come online it is a given that only a portion of the world’s expanding base of Internet users are native English speakers, so IDNs provide a huge opportunity to increase engagement, commerce and connectivity and represent a bold step forward in the globalization of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal for the localization of the Japanese internet, and is becoming a big deal for non-english speakers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.JP domains are now a bit more economical&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar topic, we&amp;#39;re reducing the price of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-jp&quot;&gt;.JP domains&lt;/a&gt; to $79, reduced from $89. If you&amp;#39;re looking to grab a local Japanese domain on the proven .JP namespace, now is a good time to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It&#39;s a big week for gTLDs, with .BERLIN, .UNO and .COMPANY</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-18-berlin-river.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Berlin&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week is a big one for the gTLD rollout, with a massive eight new domain extensions to choose from: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-academy&quot;&gt;.ACADEMY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center&quot;&gt;.CENTER&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company&quot;&gt;.COMPANY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-computer&quot;&gt;.COMPUTER&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-management&quot;&gt;.MANAGEMENT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-systems&quot;&gt;.SYSTEMS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-uno&quot;&gt;.UNO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.BERLIN gets the first city TLD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26576617&quot;&gt;From BBC News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies or individuals based in the German capital will be able to use .berlin at the end of their website addresses from 18 March, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/wirtschaft/internet-berlin-geht-mit-eigener-staedte-domain-online-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-140314-99-01746&quot;&gt;dpa news agency reports&lt;/a&gt;. The suffix - technically known as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) - was created under an agreement between Berlin&amp;#39;s local government and ICANN, the US-based organisation that co-ordinates global internet systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Berlin, cities including London, Paris, New York, Johannesburg and Japanese city Nagoya will launch their own domains. The .london suffix will become available in April. A single website with the ending .wien, representing the Austrian capital Vienna, has been live since early March but public registration for that gTLD does not open until July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startup scene in Berlin is one of the best on the planet, so we expect to see quite a few .BERLIN sites around the web in the near future. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/ich-bin-ein-berliner.html&quot;&gt;as we&amp;#39;ve said before&lt;/a&gt;, the team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotberlin.de/&quot;&gt;dotBERLIN&lt;/a&gt; is one of the true pioneers of the gTLD program, so we wish them all the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.UNO gives the Latin internet a name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/uno-looks-to-unite-the-spanish-speaking-web-an-interview-with-desiree-boxberger.html&quot;&gt;From Desiree Boxberger on the iwantmyname Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.UNO is a new domain with broad appeal and offers substantial cultural and linguistic relevance in both the Spanish and Italian languages. .UNO means &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; but it also means &amp;quot;first,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;best,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unity&amp;quot; when used in context. Our primary market consists of 490 million Spanish-speaking people around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.UNO serves to unite Spanish-speakers in one easy-to-remember place and provides a dedicated space to find information, shop and collaborate in their language of choice and comfort. In simple, .UNO = Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the bigger changes the internet is making right now is to be more inclusive of languages that aren&amp;#39;t English. We&amp;#39;re seeing Japanese TLDs, Arabic TLDs, and now we&amp;#39;re seeing a TLD in the traditional latin alphabet, but geared to a culture that&amp;#39;s seeing a massive tech surge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will .UNO be Latin America&amp;#39;s .COM catch-all domain? Will it meet .UNO&amp;#39;s projected figure of 2 million domains under management by year five? We&amp;#39;re can&amp;#39;t wait to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.COMPANY has some stiff competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll get right to the point. If you had your mind set on grabbing a domain for your company, would you go with .COMPANY over .COM or .CO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument for &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; is pretty clear, and is directly in line with the gTLD program&amp;#39;s basic goal—to give people a useful alternative to .COMs crowded namespace. So in that sense, it works. The namespace will be relatively open, giving brands an open playing field for easily remembered options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with hundreds of new TLDs offering categorical options, plus the existence of the fairly popular .CO TLD (which is still far less saturated than .COM), .COMPANY is going to be in an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pre-orders are still open (but not for long)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You still have a bit of time to pre-order a domain for one the eight gTLDs coming out this week. Just head over to the &lt;strong&gt;Coming this week&lt;/strong&gt; category on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLD page&lt;/a&gt; for the full list.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>We like Trello, too</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the right tools is extra important for small companies. We feel the impact of having to use something that just doesn&amp;#39;t quite work much more quickly and widely given that it affects a larger percentage of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, though, it&amp;#39;s also easier for small teams and individuals to try out various tools, adopting, tweaking and discarding until we find the right fit. This is not so much the case with &amp;quot;enterprise solutions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really enjoyed this behind-the-scenes piece from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobbygrace&quot;&gt;Bobby Grace&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fogcreek.com/&quot;&gt;Fog Creek&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fogcreek.com/how-we-make-trello/&quot;&gt;How We Make Trello&lt;/a&gt;. Trello is one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/the-tools-we-use-trello-for-content-and-idea-management.html&quot;&gt;favorite tools&lt;/a&gt; for project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even use it &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; the same way as the Fog Creek team does... though we celebrate with craft beers rather than champagne, and our development process has more of a blues guitar riff than a sax solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important boards for myself and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtaghall&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; are the Content ones, focusing on resources for our &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;Support Center&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. We haven&amp;#39;t managed to integrate a picture of a lumberjack punching a bear into our support documentation... yet.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Have questions? Melanie Baker is our new support scholar</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-14-waterloo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Waterloo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some math. A good portion of our business comes from good-ol&amp;#39; North America, which creates a huge problem for us—timely time-zone support coverage. In short, we&amp;#39;re in NZDT (UTC+13), while New York is in EST (UTC-5). 13--(+)5=18. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the North American East coast is looking to get their day started around 9am, it&amp;#39;s still 3am in Wellington. And by the time &amp;quot;the tireds&amp;quot; have worn off (around 11am), much of the North American east coast is packing up to go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, for us to hire a &amp;quot;Support Scholar,&amp;quot; we had to find an agile, patient, independent, funny, intelligent master of clearly crafting the English language—who lives in North America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Melanie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melanie (Melle for short) is a busy individual in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (EST, UTC-5!!!). She&amp;#39;s big in the local startup scene, organizes both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girlgeekskw.com/&quot;&gt;Waterloo Girl Geek Dinners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespeakeasylive.com/&quot;&gt;Speakeasy Tales&lt;/a&gt; (and Ales... her love of craft beer was a big plus), and has helped build and support communities for big companies you&amp;#39;ve heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you need a &amp;quot;taste&amp;quot; of her support style, here&amp;#39;s a short talk she gave about how to survive a zombie apocalypse (tons of useful information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re feeling kind, send her a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;support ticket&lt;/a&gt; and say hi. We&amp;#39;re quite happy to have her on board.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The web at 25: Our favorite websites</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-13-macbook-internet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is 25 today. A big birthday indeed—but what do you get a good friend who has everything? Cake? A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mistobox.com/&quot;&gt;Mistobox&lt;/a&gt; coffee membership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of thought, we decided to pool together all of our favorite websites to create a &amp;quot;best of&amp;quot; list. Some sites are new, some are considered old, but all have played a part in making the internet what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ingersoll - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kingersoll&quot;&gt;@kingersoll&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.com/&quot;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special mention to Chrome, which has been an huge help in pushing the web forward. From the omnibox, to speedy JS via the V8 engine, to regular releases with automatic updates (see graph of Chrome usage per version), to adoption of current and upcoming web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m not working on iwantmyname stuff, it&amp;#39;s really more about consuming content, or even better, not spending time in front of a screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to pick sites from my entire time online. So some these are old and not used much these days, but I remember spending a lot of time on them.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tim Berners-Lee on the 25th anniversary of the web</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webat25.org/&quot;&gt;From Tim Berners-Lee - Web at 25:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago today, I filed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; for what was to become the World Wide Web. My boss dubbed it ‘vague but exciting’. Luckily, he thought enough of the idea to allow me to quietly work on it on the side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following quarter-century, the Web has changed the world in ways that I never could have imagined. There have been many exciting advances. It has generated billions of dollars in economic growth, turned data into the gold of the 21st century, unleashed innovation in education and healthcare, whittled away geographic and social boundaries, revolutionised the media, and forced a reinvention of politics in many countries by enabling constant two-way dialogue between the rulers and the ruled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few principles which allowed the web, as a platform, to support such growth.  By design, the Web is universal, royalty-free, open and decentralised. Thousands of people worked together to build the early Web in an amazing, non-national spirit of collaboration; tens of thousands more invented the applications and services that make it so useful to us today, and there is still room for each one of us to create new things on and through the Web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/228960085672599552&quot;&gt;This is for everyone.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mashable highlights some great moments in a &quot;brief history of the domain name&quot;</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-11-retro-computer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;retro pic&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2014/03/10/domain-names-history/&quot;&gt;From Max Knoblauch - Mashable:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 1985, there were a whopping total of six domain names registered in the world. That number has expanded to 265 million names registered globally, according to Verisign&amp;#39;s Q3 industry brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world celebrates the web&amp;#39;s 25th anniversary, it seems fitting to acknowledge the network addresses that help us navigate through the robustness of the Internet today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first .COMs of 1985 to the massive gTLD launch of 2014, quite a bit has happened in the world of domain names. And Mashable catches some of the more interesting bits, like Mike Mann in 2012 registering nearly 15,000 domains in a single day—which may have had something to do with the internet &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html&quot;&gt;running out of four-letter .COMs&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Twitter is now supporting (most of the) gTLDs.</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh look, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twitter&quot;&gt;@twitter&lt;/a&gt; is supporting gTLDs now. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyname.domains&quot;&gt;http://iwantmyname.domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; iwantmyname (@iwantmyname) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname/statuses/443106047507828736&quot;&gt;March 10, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from general recognition that the new gTLDs exist, the biggest hurdle we face is &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/an-open-letter-to-web-platforms-about-gtld-adoption.html&quot;&gt;platform adoption&lt;/a&gt;. Or, better put, getting the big social platforms to recognize gTLDs as real domain extensions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m sure you can see the barrier we face—with the internet being as segmented and siloed as it is, these domain extensions don&amp;#39;t stand a chance unless all the big platforms get on board. Site discovery hinges on social sharing, and without it, they practically don&amp;#39;t exist. So it brings us great joy to say that just this past weekend, Twitter made the leap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/16000-twitter-starts-supporting-some-new-gtlds&quot;&gt;From Kevin Murphy - Domain Incite:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of some point in the last 48 hours, you can type something like “nic.berlin” or “fire.plumbing” in a tweet and Twitter will automatically turn it into a clickable link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The switcheroo seems to have happened in the last two days, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dotberlin/status/441314462818390016&quot;&gt;this conversation&lt;/a&gt; may illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many new TLDs launching though, adoption is looking to be an ongoing struggle—as the article indicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it seems that any TLD delegated on February 5 or earlier gets clickable links in Twitter and those delegated over the last four weeks do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even still, this is certainly a good first step. But we&amp;#39;d like to see more. A lot more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the deal. If you come across a platform that isn&amp;#39;t accepting gTLDs, let them know. And let us know so we can let them know. And then let everyone you know, know, so they can let them know, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now...go forth!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thoughts on the adoption of photography gTLDs</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-10-camera.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camera&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY, .PHOTOS, .PHOTO—there are a number of new gTLDs related to photography, but just because something exists doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will take off. So we put this up on Twitter hoping for some replies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear internet, &amp;#10;&amp;#10;We&amp;#39;re looking for opinionated iwantmyname users/photographers for a quick email interview. Interested? Tweet us back!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; iwantmyname (@iwantmyname) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname/statuses/441344749686226944&quot;&gt;March 5, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then sent out the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think about the new photography gTLDs coming out? From a business standpoint, do you think it&amp;#39;s wise to grab a .PHOTOGRAPHY or .PHOTOS domain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what we got back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josiah Wiebe - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/josiahwiebe&quot;&gt;@josiahwiebe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do like the simplicity of the new gTLDs, however, I&amp;#39;m not fully sold. One thing I&amp;#39;ve noticed is browsers not fully supporting them. I cannot type vim.sexy (Vim text editor) into a browser without the http://. It just gives me a search engine search. On that same tangent, most commoners of the web don&amp;#39;t even look at the domain name. They rarely even type a domain in a complete sense! They&amp;#39;ll usually just enter the phrase into Google, or enter the domain into Google and click he first result. A lot of people operate on the belief that all websites are accessed through Google. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have few non-standard domains for my area, such as .es or .be, as they work well with my name. I get a lot of confusion from the average person, since typing thewiebes into Google will net far different results than typing thewieb.es. For me, it seems like a new gTLD is a great way to protect your brand, but not absolutely essential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Berry - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thoughtmerchant&quot;&gt;@thoughtmerchant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the new TLDs coming out are going to result in an explosion of new creative ways for people and companies to express themselves.The .photos or .photo are a great opportunity for photographers. I think certain very touristy locations for photos could capitalize on these domains. The .photography domain sounds a bit of a stretch since the average length of a normal domain is 11 characters. Since the .photography domain &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; 11 characters, the length scares me off a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Hamnett - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/craighamnett&quot;&gt;@craighamnett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint there are pros and cons with the new gTLDs. If you&amp;#39;re heavily invested in a business brand, grabbing the gTLDs is essential to ensure that hard work doesn&amp;#39;t get ruined by a poacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that you really have to look at why you would purchase the new gTLD. Predominantly you want to generate revenue from your websites. This is done by things like search engine referrals or word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search Engines: It is yet to be seen how much emphasis search engines will place on these new gTLDs. Will spammers do what they usually do and ruin the fun for everyone? Will Google treat all gTLDs with caution until they can be trusted? We currently don&amp;#39;t have much info on that, so there&amp;#39;s definitely an element of the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of Mouth: Word of mouth is interesting. The &amp;quot;average joe&amp;quot; equates websites with .com or local ccTLDs. It will take some time for this mindset to change; if it&amp;#39;s going to at all. If it does and you get into a conversation with somebody, they might pull out their phone to look at your website. Then you have to wait even longer for them to type .PHOTOGRAPHY instead of .COM - frustrating. There is a reason why KISS works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just those two points, personally I would only be registering a gTLD from a vanity point of view. I am quite vain, so you may see my buying one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeff Melz - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thecultureofme&quot;&gt;@thecultureofme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m super into the new TLDs, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how many photographers will really bite just yet. Lots of parked domains and forwarding if anything. I might grab .photos though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potentially - although it&amp;#39;s expensive and might confuse some people who aren’t familiar with the concept of the new long TLDs. So I wouldn’t want to rely solely on a gTLD to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Some new additions to our gTLD page</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-08-gtld-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;gTLD page&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 499 new generic Top-Level Domains currently sitting in our list. 499—a ton of domain extensions just waiting to be discovered. But categorizing them all and breaking them into useful lists is quite a chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, we simply parsed them out into categories and left it at that. For a time, it was a great way to discover new gTLDs like .SHOP and .BEER, but once the launches came though it became a mess of pre-orders and launched domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last night, we added some new categories to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;the new gTLD page&lt;/a&gt; a bit more useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available to register&lt;/strong&gt; - Looking for a list of the gTLDs you can buy today? This is the page for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launched this week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming next week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps! And keep tuning back in the coming weeks and months for more useful changes and additional gTLD information.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>You can now use Getty Images for free. Really.</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-06-getty.png&quot; alt=&quot;Getty imbed&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/need-images-for-your-site-here-are-some-tips-for-doing-it-right-tip-1-never-use-the-corporate-high-five.html&quot;&gt;wrote a bit about using stock photography&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, but today we found some news that might change everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use&quot;&gt;From Russell Brandom - The Verge:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to the Getty Images website, you&amp;#39;ll see millions of images, all watermarked. There are more than a hundred years of photography here, from FDR on the campaign trail to last Sunday&amp;#39;s Oscars, all stamped with the same transparent square placard reminding you that you don&amp;#39;t own the rights. If you want Getty to take off the watermark, you&amp;#39;ll have to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting now, that&amp;#39;s going to change. Getty Images is dropping the watermark for the bulk of its collection, in exchange for an open-embed program that will let users drop in any image they want, as long as the service gets to append a footer at the bottom of the picture with a credit and link to the licensing page. For a small-scale Wordpress blog with no photo budget, this looks an awful lot like free stock imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free. Stock. Imagery. And not just free stock imagery—this is free stock imagery from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gettyimages.com/&quot;&gt;Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I definitely recommend reading through the full article above if you&amp;#39;re interested in how this transition will all play out. It&amp;#39;s a really big deal, and will hopefully go a long way towards making the web a more visually appealing place.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The real reason we use Markdown</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-03-05-markdown.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may be based in New Zealand, but a large percentage of our business is done in the US. And aside from driving on the wrong side of the road and using a perplexing system for measurements and temperatures, it&amp;#39;s a fairly seamless cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But early this year we made a change to ease some of our remaining differences. Specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/tools-we-use-mou-for-writing.html&quot;&gt;we switched to Markdown for blogging&lt;/a&gt;—just to avoid any sort of confusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-1-10-americans-html-std-study-finds-20140304,0,1188415.story#ixzz2v1RQr6Ni&quot;&gt;From Salvador Rodriguez - LA Times, in a post titled &amp;quot;1 in 10 Americans think HTML is an STD, study finds&amp;quot;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re talking tech with Americans, you may want to avoid using any jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study found that many Americans are lost when it comes to tech-related terms, with 11% saying that they thought HTML — a language that is used to create websites — was a sexually transmitted disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Last week in gTLDs, including .RECIPES, .SHOES and .INDUSTRIES</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week, another set of gTLDs with launch dates, prices and current availability. Last week we saw .DIAMONDS, .TIPS, .ENTERPRISES and .VOYAGE go live, but this weeks batch of newly delegated gTLDs brings to light some intense domain name competition. Can .SUPPLY and .SUPPLIES coexist? Is the internet big enough for the two of them?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Simplicity wins again—.UK coming soon to a registrar near you</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-28-uk-flag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;UK Flag&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/15707-nominet-names-the-date-for-shorter-uk-addresses&quot;&gt;From Kevin Murphy - Domain Incite:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominet is to start selling .uk domain names at the second level for the first time on June 10 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial Direct.uk service will enable people to register example.uk names, rather than example.co.uk names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with the low-hanging fruit. Second level domain names are great because they strip away complexity. .CO.UK, .ORG.UK, .ME.UK—they just reek of excess (ok, that was a bit dramatic). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, domain names look much nicer when they&amp;#39;re tidied up. But here&amp;#39;s where things get interesting. Say you have a .CO.UK domain you&amp;#39;re perfectly happy with.  Instead of being a cool alternative like the new gTLDs, the new .UK domain is a necessity. It&amp;#39;s your brand name, simplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least you have plenty of time to think about it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dotuklaunch.co.uk/faq/how-will-it-work&quot;&gt;From the Dot UK FAQ:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the vast majority of you who already have a domain with us...we will automatically reserve the equivalent .uk for you for free for five years. At any point during that period you can decide to register the new .uk domain as long as your existing domain continues to be registered to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- space --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your domain name is eligible for the .uk equivalent, but you don’t want to register it, no one else will be able to register it in the five year reservation period. But once the five years are up, the domain will become available to anyone who wants to register it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>An interview with Frank Schilling about Uniregistry, .SEXY, .TATTOO and not joining the registry dark side</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p75KeJN9D0E&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are domain registries, and there are domain registries with ambitious founders located in the Cayman Islands. Much to the enjoyment of the likely tan staff at &lt;a href=&quot;http://uniregistry.com/&quot;&gt;Uniregistry&lt;/a&gt;, they are in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched to the public in 2014, Uniregistry has seven domain extensions coming out this year, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&quot;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gift&quot;&gt;.GIFT&lt;/a&gt; (offered by Dot Gift, LLC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guitars&quot;&gt;.GUITARS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&quot;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&quot;&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/a&gt;, and two that were just released yesterday—&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sexy&quot;&gt;.SEXY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo&quot;&gt;.TATTOO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the fairly conservative gTLDs that have been released thus far, .SEXY and .TATTOO represent edgy fun, giving an alternative crowd some gTLD to latch onto. So we decided to ask Frank Schilling, Founder and Managing Director of Uniregistry, a few questions about how it&amp;#39;s all going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were a fortune teller and I came to you asking about .TATTOO and .SEXY, what would you tell me? Long, happy life? Fast growth? What does the future hold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOL. I honestly think .TATTOO and .SEXY will be a lot like me. Slow start. Late bloomer. Big success in later years. These strings are low priced, have high registrar margins and tons of natural affinity. I think they are long-term niches that won’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.TATTOO already has a built-in marketplace, but .SEXY seems to be open to interpretation. What kinds of sites do you see popping up with .SEXY domains?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very good question. I think it’s the ultimate discrete adult fashion [domain]. People will find ways to interpret where that takes them. If I were a model or a dancer or an entertainer, .SEXY is delightfully benign and leaves just enough to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of the .TATTOO marketplace, it&amp;#39;s always interesting to hear about people&amp;#39;s apprehension to stray from .COM. Do you foresee any issues with getting tattoo shops to make the leap?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No—none at all. There is safety in numbers and with so many new extensions coming we’re in good shape from an acceptability standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a marketing prospective, how are you getting .SEXY and .TATTOO in front of your future customers? It seems that tech-centric gTLDs are doing alright because their audience is up on the gTLD namespace expansion, but what about the non-tech crowd?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re going to rely on our registrar partners to suggest our names as viable alternatives—and we have our own registrar and direct marketing for that beginning March 8th. I definitely view this as a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-27-uniregistry-careers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about Uniregistry itself. Many people probably think you all just sit on gorgeous Cayman Island beaches all day, but your job page has openings for software developers, systems specialists and marketing people. What&amp;#39;s day to day life like at Uniregistry? And what kinds of things are you working on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a beach here??!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing we’ve been working on is our registrar and registries.  It has been a ton of work and will be a mature product this year. We’re developing interesting ways to deliver domains to consumers...its work. But we feel confident we’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And one last question.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have some very user-friendly policies like no restore fees, a long restore period and no priority access phases. We dig this a lot at iwantmyname! What made you decide to not join the dark side of the registry force?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember what it was like to be a registrant. We want our spaces to be easy to use, easy to develop and easy to trade with hands-off governance of registrants. We want our registrants to thrive here. There will be bumps along the way as we’re new at this, but I’m confident we’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>This new domain scam is quite tricky indeed</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faster than a relative of Nigerian royalty email. More powerful than a UK lottery scam. Domain scams target people in a place not many are knowledgable about—their online presence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest domain scam is especially vicious because it touches on a vulnerability everyone has. With more than a hundred domain extensions available, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;hundreds more being added&lt;/a&gt; in this latest gTLD rollout, there&amp;#39;s no way any brand can fully protect their online name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when a stranger from Asia tells you they&amp;#39;ve secured your brand on an obscure Asian TLD like &amp;quot;.org.cn,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s only natural to be worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how this scam works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbb.org/blog/2014/02/dont-get-pressured-into-purchasing-useless-domains/&quot;&gt;From Emily Patterson - Better Business Bureau:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You receive an email addressed to the owner of your company. It appears to be from an Asian domain registration service. The email says that a third party company has requested to register your business’s brand name as a website domain in China or elsewhere in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the email, the “domain registrar” realized your company owns that brand name. And they decided to do you a favor and offer to register the domain for you instead of this other company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch? There is no competing business, and the price to purchase the domain is much higher than you would pay elsewhere. Often, the email sender isn’t even an actual domain registration business. He/she simply purchases the domain elsewhere for a few dollars and immediately sells it back to the victim for an inflated price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be smart about protecting your brand. Securing your name in a bunch of TLDs is an option, but know that your SEO is going to be tied to the domain that&amp;#39;s producing all the content. For example, if you search for iwantmyname, you&amp;#39;re going to get our URL, not an uninhabited knockoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you&amp;#39;re looking to transition to, or augment your domain with, a new gTLD, grab it now so others can&amp;#39;t. For instance, if you&amp;#39;re a bike shop, now would be a good time to get a .BIKE domain. Don&amp;#39;t feel that this is an essential branding step though. If you&amp;#39;re producing good/useful content, people will be able to find you no matter what your domain extension is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you&amp;#39;re an organization in China, you don&amp;#39;t need a .org.cn domain name. You just don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a general rule, always question domain mail from sources other than your preferred domain registrar. And if you aren&amp;#39;t sure about something, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;ask us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbb.org/council/bbb-scam-stopper/scam-alerts/&quot;&gt;BBB Scam Stopper&lt;/a&gt; is a good resource to check. If anything, you&amp;#39;ll gain awareness of all the craziness out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Not receiving email at your domain? Check for a CNAME record on the root level.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We used to hear this all too frequently in our support channels. A customer adds a new DNS record for their website and suddenly can&amp;#39;t receive email on their domain—the email service that had been working fine in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause? That CNAME record that was just added to the naked/root domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joshstrange.com/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-put-a-cname-record-on-your-root-domain/&quot;&gt;Josh Strange recently published an article&lt;/a&gt; relaying this exact situation where a seemingly convenient CNAME record on his root domain prevented his email service from working without him realizing it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just this last weekend I went to signup for an eBay Developers account so I could play with the API but the email confirmation never came through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- this is just to break up the block quotes --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something clicked in my head and I started to vaguely remember reading something when first setting up my blog about how CNAME records don&amp;#39;t belong on your root domain. When I had read that I had written it off as I did not fully understand what it was saying at the time. Now, armed with this revelation, I started searching for &amp;quot;CNAME and MX conflicts&amp;quot; and found countless people warning against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of digging, he found &lt;a href=&quot;http://serverfault.com/a/91718/14374&quot;&gt;the answer on ServerFault&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common error. You cannot use a CNAME RR for your root domain (e.g. company.com) &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; define additional resource records for the same zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.dnsmadeeasy.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/14/0/why-cant-i-create-a-cname-record-for-the-root-record&quot;&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t I create a CNAME record for the root record?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1034.html&quot;&gt;RFC1034&lt;/a&gt; section 3.6.2 for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we understand that DNS can be tricky and we don&amp;#39;t expect you to know all the ins-and-outs. For your sanity, our DNS manager prevents you from adding a CNAME record to your root domain. And all of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;one-click DNS configurations&lt;/a&gt; ensure that this doesn&amp;#39;t happen either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can, of course, still add this record for you, but only after you confirm that you understand the risks of breaking the RFC. For web apps that require a CNAME record (e.g. Heroku, Ghost), we redirect your naked domain to the &amp;quot;www&amp;quot; variant so that the CNAME can be used correctly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Last week in gTLDs, including .WIKI, .XYZ and .TODAY</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;#39;s new gTLD launch was an interesting one, with .TECHNOLOGY barely beating out .DIRECTORY and .LAND for weekly launch stat supremacy. This week though we have an eclectic bunch—a few web favorites (.ENTERPRISES and .TIPS), some alternative fun (.TATTOO and .SEXY) and a pair that would fit right into a pirate movie (.DIAMONDS and .VOYAGE).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.UNO looks to unite the Spanish-speaking web—an interview with Desiree Boxberger of Dot Latin LLC</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/G9pmT7icoAQ&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search the web long enough, you&amp;#39;ll find quite a few opinions of the new gTLD rollout. Some think it&amp;#39;s a moneymaking scheme. Some question the public interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s put the cynicism aside for a moment. .COM was the de-facto champ in the domain race because it was first one dedicated for commercial use. But in addition to becoming scarce (all the four-letter options are gone), .COM is quite generic. It doesn&amp;#39;t categorize nationalities. Or industries. Or groups. It&amp;#39;s just a generic catch-all that, today, is the de-facto web standard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this new gTLD rollout is a grand experiment. An experiment to see if the public is ready for change. So we reached out to Desiree Boxberger of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-uno&quot;&gt;.UNO&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions about their vision and what the future holds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.UNO is quite different from many other gTLDs because it&amp;#39;s not a categorical phrase, meaning it has no built-in target audience. What kinds of businesses and brands do you see adopting your gTLD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.UNO is a new domain with broad appeal and offers substantial cultural and linguistic relevance in both the Spanish and Italian languages. .UNO means &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; but it also means &amp;quot;first,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;best,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unity&amp;quot; when used in context. Our primary market consists of 490 million Spanish-speaking people around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.UNO serves to unite Spanish-speakers in one easy-to-remember place and provides a dedicated space to find information, shop and collaborate in their language of choice and comfort. In simple, .UNO = Spanish.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing we hear a lot about these new gTLDs is, &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; We&amp;#39;re big fans of the namespace expansion at iwantmyname, but why does the world need new TLDs in your eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fully support ICANN&amp;#39;s expansion of the domain name system and believe it will spark renewed interest, drive innovation and further expand global eCommerce opportunities. Finding a short, memorable and relevant domain name, in the traditional 22 top level domains, is near impossible. Why? Because they are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;registered and unavailable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;registered and the owner wants to sell at a high price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;available and not desirable or valuable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain name is absolutely key to success on the Internet and small businesses starting out just can&amp;#39;t afford to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a short, memorable and relevant domain name. At .UNO, we offer a renewed opportunity to secure a short, memorable and relevant domain name for much less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet is booming right now in Latin America, and as we know, new users means new sites. Do you think .UNO could ever replace .COM as the TLD of choice for Latin American users? Is that even the goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We certainly would welcome being the #1 choice for a top level domain in Latin America; however, we&amp;#39;re not about replacing other types of domains. We believe many users, in Latin America and elsewhere, will continue to use their existing domains but in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a business has a .com they may use that for strictly their English site, add a .UNO for a Spanish site, and use or add a country-code domain for in-country search results, depending on their location. Each domain serves an intended purpose and gone are the days where one domain covers all areas of your business. Our focus is to really expand choice and at an affordable price.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe .UNO will be well positioned for adoption in Latin America because of its relevance to the culture, the language and the ability to globally transact commerce outside country borders under the unification of a common language, Spanish.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With .UNO, it&amp;#39;s now &amp;quot;Press 1&amp;quot; for Spanish on the Internet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As far as marketing goes, how does a TLD like .UNO get into the general lexicon? Will it be a slow rise or are there plans in the works to get sites to switch over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are simultaneously driving a top-down bottom-up marketing approach. We are actively engaged with large corporations in the U.S., who have Hispanic initiatives, to drive adoption of a .UNO domain name for their Spanish language website. We&amp;#39;re also talking with Hispanic Chambers&amp;#39; of Commerce and Hispanic owned small businesses about the benefits of using a .UNO domain name as a Spanish language website and how to increase SEO results with Spanish content. We are working with Hispanic and Latino celebrities and we&amp;#39;re attending key Hispanic social events to drive wide spread awareness with consumers and individuals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic builds are never easy but we&amp;#39;re fully committed and determined to globally spread the word, drive adoption and change the world with .UNO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the future of .UNO? In 5 years, where do you think the TLD will be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because .UNO is one of the first new domains to hit the market, it will take time to build general awareness in order to drive adoption and use. This will be a challenge for all new top level domain registries as they map out their go to market strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our forecasts indicate that .UNO will have about 2 million domains under management by year five. We believe this is a conservative estimate based on the size of our market segment and anticipated popularity as awareness spreads and interest grows. With Hispanic populations growing at one of the fastest rates, coupled with the fact that Hispanics are technology adopters, we believe .UNO is well positioned to be very successful.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ben Pieratt can help you name your project</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From Ben Pieratt&amp;#39;s blog, in a post titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pieratt.com/post/77293289254/a-3-step-process-for-naming-a-project-product-and&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;A 3-step process for naming a project/product. (And some resources)&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naming a project is always an awful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earworm that won’t stop tapping your skull from the inside. A tenacious pop jingle with teeth and a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a freelance designer, I do a fair amount of this for clients. Generally, my process has been a garble of notes and trips to thesaurus.com, but lately I’ve noticed a fairly simple pattern emerging, a 3-step framework for cutting through the fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to name your personal or business brand/project, this is a wonderful guide. It&amp;#39;s short, concise and has a ton of great resources you can use to help you along the way (including iwantmyname... thanks Ben!).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thoughts on Editorially closing, why I don&#39;t use web-based editors (yet) and why speed is the killer feature</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-21-wordperfect.png&quot; alt=&quot;WordPerfect&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first document I can clearly remember typing into a computer was a fake constitution for a fake country I made up in 5th grade. It was awesome, and I typed it out on WordPerfect for DOS—a platform so hideously ugly that you never worried about what the documents looked like. You just wrote and wrote, and when you were done, you saved the file and printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was it. Open program, write document, save it, print it. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward two decades and text editing is starting to come full circle. While I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it commonly accepted yet, tons of writers are dropping their bloated word processors and switching to minimalist, Markdown-compatible apps. And they&amp;#39;re doing it because speed is key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a web writer, my best process is to get my ideas down as fast as I humanly can, then edit them down once I&amp;#39;m done. With Microsoft Word and Apple Pages, there are so many style options and formatting quirks that writing becomes a pain, but with an app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/tools-we-use-mou-for-writing.html&quot;&gt;Mou&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;#39;s nothing to hold me up. My new process is much like my old one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the Mou icon, write document, save to Dropbox, publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My process is really fast, but the writers of the world wouldn&amp;#39;t be trying hard if we weren&amp;#39;t always looking for something better. Enter Editorially: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to support and encourage that writing process — from the first flash of inspiration all the way through to publication, and at every point in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editorially achieves this goal in many ways: a Markdown-based writing environment lets you focus on the words and create clean markup easily; collaboration tools let you invite friends and trusted colleagues to review or edit your work; a document version system lets you mark points in a document’s history and compare versions to see what changed; notes and activity feeds encourage you to reflect on your work, for yourself and for others; and discussion threads recognize that the conversation around a text is just as important as the text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be the first to tell you that Editorially does a lot of cool things—especially nice is the fact that as a web app, it works beautifully every platform and every screen size—but it has one major flaw. To write a document, here&amp;#39;s the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open browser, go to editorially.com, sign in, click &amp;quot;New document&amp;quot;, name the document, write document, save to Dropbox, publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-21-editorially.png&quot; alt=&quot;signin&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these tasks are practically reflexes at this point, but it&amp;#39;s still eight steps against four. And it gets even worse when you look at opening a file. With Mou, I can just click on a file in a folder and it opens. With Editorially, I have to enter the walled garden. Again, nothing too dramatic, but every little bit matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html&quot;&gt;It kind of reminds me of an old Google bit:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of looking, Marissa explained that they found an uncontrolled variable. The page with 10 results took .4 seconds to generate. The page with 30 results took .9 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a second delay caused a 20% drop in traffic. Half a second delay killed user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely saw this in my own personal experience. I was a big advocate of Editorially from the start, but I could never really explain why I didn&amp;#39;t use it regularly. Even with a host of great features, the writing process was never a joy. As a user, I was never truly satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stet.editorially.com/articles/goodbye/&quot;&gt;From Editorially:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today brings some sad news: Editorially is closing its doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re proud of the team and tool that we built together and incredibly thankful that so many of you were willing to give it a try. And we continue to believe that evolving the way we collaborate as writers and editors is important work. But Editorially has failed to attract enough users to be sustainable, and we cannot honestly say we have reason to expect that to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are my takeaways from this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is the primary focus for writers. Anything that adds time between the ideas and the typing is a negative. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a web-based text editor to really take off, it probably will need to get creative with how it can access files (see: Google Drive).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editorially&amp;#39;s online collaborative document management system is a great idea, and the platform might&amp;#39;ve succeeded if there was a corresponding document-creation app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed is, and will always be, the &amp;quot;killer feature.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>An introduction to Ghost with John O&#39;Nolan</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-20-ghost.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ghost&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of platforms your could use to get a blog up and running, but one of the newest entries into the field is perhaps the most exciting—a platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. And what makes it exciting is that it doesn&amp;#39;t try to do everything for everyone. There are no e-commerce features, no integrated social networks and no ambitions to create fully blown-out sites—it&amp;#39;s just a platform for (beautifully) publishing content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Ghost site states, &amp;quot;Ghost is an Open Source application which allows you to write and publish your own blog, giving you the tools to make it easy and even fun to do. It&amp;#39;s simple, elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time making your blog work and more time blogging.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to help you decide if Ghost is the right platform for your blog, I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnONolan&quot;&gt;John O&amp;#39;Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, the guy who &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.onolan.org/project-ghost/&quot;&gt;originally dreamed up the platform&lt;/a&gt;, many of the questions people have asked me. And because he&amp;#39;s such a great guy (I&amp;#39;m serious, he&amp;#39;s a really great guy), he was happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Say you&amp;#39;re brand new to blogging. Starting from scratch. What differentiates a platform like Ghost from Wordpress, Squarespace, Tumblr and the rest of the platforms out there? What does the prototypical Ghost user look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is an excellent question! Each of these platforms are actually pretty incredible pieces of software. The important thing is that they all do slightly different things, and are built in slightly different ways, so it really comes down to choosing what’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want a simple website with e-commerce that you use to run your business website? Give Squarespace a try. If you want to participate in a social network with sharing and re-posting and lots of cats, maybe Tumblr would be a better fit for you. On the other hand, if you’re looking to develop your own fully-fledged website or application with every imaginable bell and whistle, WordPress might be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a simple but powerful independent publication. Something which is focused on the writing experience and giving you the freedom to be in complete control of your content. Well, then you might find Ghost interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Ok, so Ghost sounds like what I&amp;#39;m looking for. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&quot;&gt;With my domain name in hand&lt;/a&gt;, how much work am I going to have to do to get my blog up and running? Do I need anything extra like hosting space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be! So there are two ways to set up a blog with Ghost and that shiny new domain name you’re holding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; and start using our hosted platform. The hosted platform is a service which allows you to start a new Ghost blog in a couple of clicks, and has premium plans starting at just $5 per month. The other great thing about our hosted platform is that all the money we make from it actually goes towards funding developers to work on the Ghost software and make it better. We’re a very proud non-profit, so this helps the entire project in a big way - and yes! You can use your domain name here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Ghost is Open Source, you can actually download it and run the software on (almost) any computer in the world. It’ll work on your laptop, your web server, or even your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;. So if you’re a developer and you’d like to roll-your-own installation of Ghost. You can certainly do that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: The biggest fear I have is that my blog will feel super generic. What can I do to really personalize my blog&amp;#39;s appearance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a wise fear to have. It’s always important to make your blog unique and memorable, branding is a big deal! Fortunately, there are hundreds (soon: thousands) of beautiful Ghost themes which you can install to add a beautiful design to your blog and really make it stand out. &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketplace.ghost.org&quot;&gt;The best place to start is by having a look on our marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll find a very large collection of different styles and options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I&amp;#39;ve read that on Wordpress I can get plugins like Yoast to boost my SEO—and ranking high in Google is super important to me. Is there something like that on Ghost? Should I even be worried about SEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search Engine Optimisation is something which is absolutely pivotal to the success of a blog. We’ve done a huge amount of work inside Ghost to make sure that search engines can find your blog easily from the get-go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is built-in so that you don’t have to rely on third party extensions to get a great SEO experience. It’s also worth noting that one of the biggest ranking factors that search engines look at these days is page-load speed. Because of the technology which Ghost is built on, it loads fast. Really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What does the future hold for Ghost? In 2020, will my blog seem as dated as my friend&amp;#39;s Xanga site does today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to tell you - you should immediately cut ties with this friend. Being associated with Xanga lover is just not something you want to come out in public. It’s time for an intervention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost has very big ambitions. The future for Ghost is very much aimed towards creating a platform to power large online publications. Unlike some of the more trendy social networks which depend on buzz to survive - Ghost is really just a tool to get things done, so it will always be useful. We’ll be adding much more functionality around the publishing and collaborative writing experience as we grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is there anything else I should know before getting started? Anything I haven’t thought of yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you’ve asked some really great questions, and I feel like that shouldn’t be ignored - so here’s a discount coupon which will give you 2 months free on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; hosted platform, if you’d like to give it a try! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code: &lt;code&gt;IWMN2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Need images for your site? Here are some tips for doing it right (Tip 1: never use the corporate high five)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-18-corporate-terrible.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;corporate high five&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to clearly identify what makes a site special, but one thing that certainly helps is interesting photography. Big images. Graphics that aren&amp;#39;t bound to little corners of posts, but are given room to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to get good stuff, you have to do it the right way. Yes, I know that dragging images from the web and dropping them into your posts is technically feasible, but without proper attributions and licensing, you&amp;#39;re playing on the wrong side of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll spare you the legalese here. It comes down to this—people work really hard to produce quality photography and graphics. So please, don&amp;#39;t steal it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re interested, here are some tips to keep you out of moral grey areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paid stock photography doesn&amp;#39;t have to suck. Sure, there are thousands of terrible photos of corporate teams high fiving (see above), but sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shutterstock.com/&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigstockphoto.com/&quot;&gt;Bigstock&lt;/a&gt; are filled with millions of great images, vectors and videos, with more added every day. Again, just don&amp;#39;t (EVER) use the corporate high five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also find free stock photos. Good ones. Here&amp;#39;s a great list by Dustin Senos of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/p/62ae4bcbe01b&quot;&gt;best free stock photo sites&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;#39;s found (and it looks like he&amp;#39;s updating it as he finds more).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/&quot;&gt;Flickr Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome tool. Basically, users from all over the world upload photos for public use under the Creative Commons License. Just be sure to follow the rules. And no, adding a little &amp;quot;image from&amp;quot; blurb at the bottom of a post isn&amp;#39;t bothersome to readers at all. It just shows you care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything is possible if you ask nicely. If you see an image you love online, you can always ask the site owner if you can use it yourself. Yes, they have the right to say no (or not respond at all), but it can&amp;#39;t hurt to ask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>This week in gTLDs, including .CLUB, .KIWI and .TODAY</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, seven new gTLDs hit the market, making us 14 domain extensions into the &amp;quot;post-.COM era.&amp;quot; But what lies ahead? Well, in addition to another seven gTLDS coming out this week, we have  newly announced launch dates, prices and a slew of newly delegated gTLDs, including .EVENTS, .RENTALS and .REVIEWS.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An interview with Jordan Schau of Pure Fix Cycles about .BIKE, new gTLDs and fixies</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-14-purefix.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;purefixcycles.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 5th marked an important day in domain name history. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html&quot;&gt;Seven new gTLDs were released to the public&lt;/a&gt;, including .CLOTHING, .GURU, .HOLDINGS, .SINGLES, .PLUMBING, .VENTURES and .BIKE. As a domain registrar, we have unique insight into gTLD popularity—we have data!—but at the end of the day, we really have no idea how these domains will be used. Will companies completely switch over from .COM? Are these domains being used for fun side projects? We have no idea—so we decided to ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, we have Jordan Schau of &lt;a href=&quot;http://purefixcycles.com/&quot;&gt;Pure Fix Cycles&lt;/a&gt;, who is the proud owner of quite a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.BIKE domains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Jordan, thanks for doing this with us! So first, tell me a bit about yourself, your company and why fixies are so awesome (people should know!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmm about me, thats a tough one! I’m a tech nerd with a passion for bikes.  I started Pure Fix Cycles with my brother and two best friends right out of college, and the idea was to be a direct-to-consumer offering for stylish and affordable bikes. So thats what we did. Now, we’re in over 500 stores and shipping bikes across the globe - spreading the fixed gear love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are fixies awesome? Have you seen one!? They’re just those bikes you see that look incredibly cool and require almost no maintenance. They’re also really fun to ride. Sold yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; As you know, .BIKE was released to the public on February 5th—and you&amp;#39;re now the proud owner of quite a few .BIKE domains. If you don&amp;#39;t mind me asking, what are some of your plans for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, to be entirely honest, I’m not so sure! Some domains will probably just point to purefixcycles.com like fixedgear.bike and others we’ll do something a bit more fun. One little fun one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nicks.bike&quot;&gt;nicks.bike&lt;/a&gt; - thats Nick’s bike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&amp;#39;s the big question. As a small business owner, do you think you&amp;#39;ll ever move your company from a .com domain to a .bike domain—or any other generic domain extension for that matter? Is the world ready for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; I doubt we’ll ever switch our dot com domains to dot bike domains entirely, but thats not to say they both can&amp;#39;t coexist. The simplest way might be having things forward to other domains like we’re doing with fixedgear.bike. If we were to launch something totally new, I wouldn&amp;#39;t count out using a fresh new .bike domain. But, I don’t think the mainstream is quite ready to trust .bike domains yet. An example: I told my partner that we got fixedgear.bike and he said “So if we go to fixedgear.bike dot com, that will be us?” People are just so used to .coms that it will be tough to jump ship to .bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; There are so many small-business owners looking to create their own sites, but don&amp;#39;t even know where to start. But your site really is beautiful. Big images, custom logos, nice typography—how did you build it? And what sort of platform/hosting are you using?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; We use (and love) &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; to host Pure Fix. They’ve been a really great partner for us to work with. We also have an awesome team that helps with everything! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So give me the rundown. The city I&amp;#39;m in is flat with good bike lanes and a few great coffee shops and bars to ride to and from. But nothing is super close, so I&amp;#39;d like to go as fast as possible. What&amp;#39;s the bike for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; The bike for you? I’d say one of our original fixies! I ride a &lt;a href=&quot;http://purefixcycles.com/products/whiskey-grey-blue-fixie&quot;&gt;Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; to my local cafe in Hollywood all the time and its perfect. If you’re riding to the bar, wear a helmet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a fixie of your own, check Jordan&amp;#39;s company out at &lt;a href=&quot;http://purefixcycles.com/&quot;&gt;purefixcycles.com&lt;/a&gt;. And be sure to follow them on Twitter too &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pfcycles&quot;&gt;@PFCycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Looking for some email love this Valentine&#39;s Day?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pobox.com/2014/02/a-valentine-for-email-lovers.html&quot;&gt;From Vanessa Cannon - Pobox:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valentine&amp;#39;s Day is Pobox&amp;#39;s favorite holiday -- we&amp;#39;ve been in love with email for 19 years! This year, as a valentine to all you folks out there who love email as much as we do, we&amp;#39;re adding two new bonuses for accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a user for less:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a second user to your account, and you&amp;#39;ll get an automatic 10% discount on both accounts! The 10% discount is automatically applied for groups with 2 to 4 users. Accounts with 5 or more users get a 20% discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add AllMail for free:&lt;/strong&gt; Mailstore accounts can add AllMail for 2 personal domains for free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email forwarding is one of those things you don&amp;#39;t think about, but can vastly improve the way you interact with your mail. As they say, it allows you to &amp;quot;separate where you read your email from your email identity. Forwarding takes mail sent to one address, and redirects it to another, without the sender having to know.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding&quot;&gt;Pobox&lt;/a&gt; puts out a really nice product, and even if you don&amp;#39;t think you need it, you should check them out. Because they absolutely love email—and because it&amp;#39;s Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, their favorite holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An open letter to web platforms about gTLD adoption</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Web Platforms, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love you—I love you—but you&amp;#39;re making us sad. See, we&amp;#39;re currently undergoing the biggest change in domain name history, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;more than 500 gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; coming out in the near future. But without your help, adoption rates will suffer. And if adoption rates suffer, the vast expansion of the internet namespace is all for naught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started just this week. A support ticket came in saying a customer couldn&amp;#39;t get their new gTLD to work in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;. Then another in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;. Then another in Google Apps—built by a company that&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seroundtable.com/google-gtlds-15301.html&quot;&gt;bidding to own quite a few gTLDs themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, we thought it might be us. Maybe we did something to anger the TLD gods? Fortunately it wasn&amp;#39;t a problem on our end—the new gTLDs just weren&amp;#39;t registering as actual domain names in various platform dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a hard update to make, but keeping up with the pace of the launches is proving to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, we get it. Running our domain registrar is hard work, and I can&amp;#39;t really imagine loading up with rapid-fire updates out of left field. So for web platforms and hosted services offering custom domains, I can certainly see how something like this could go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s what I can do to help. If you work for a web platform and email me directly at chris at iwantmyname dot com, I&amp;#39;ll personally send you a list of the new TLDs being released to the general public the following week. That&amp;#39;ll give you time to add them into your system—and will hopefully prevent some support tickets coming your way in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, here are some additional resources (the ones we use) for finding out which TLDs exist or are in the pipeline currently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db&quot;&gt;IANA Root Zone Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings&quot;&gt;ICANN Delegated Strings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://publicsuffix.org/list/effective_tld_names.dat&quot;&gt;Mozilla Public Suffix List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps... and thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Hemingway is the coach you need to make your web content better</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-13-hemingway.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hemingway&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine out of ten writers agree—writing is tough. And one of the toughest things writers face is falling into comfort zones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, it seems that the better you are at your craft, the easier it is to identify that you have flaws. But that doesn&amp;#39;t make them any easier to fix. Without an aggressive editor or an angry comment section to pick you apart your flaws, sometimes even obvious weaknesses get overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are solo content creators to do? Enter Hemingway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemingway has gotten quite a bit of buzz today in the content world because it fills a real gap in content creation. In short, it&amp;#39;s a web-based blog editor that picks apart your flaws. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hemingwayapp.com/&quot;&gt;From Hemingway:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemingway highlights long, complex sentences and common errors; if you see a yellow highlight, shorten the sentence or split it. If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic — try editing this sentence to remove the red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adverbs are helpfully shown in blue. Get rid of them and pick verbs with force instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can utilize a shorter word in place of a purple one. Mouse over it for hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phrases in green have been marked to show passive voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theawl.com/2014/02/a-farewell-to-smarms&quot;&gt;Dan Nosowitz of the Awl puts it&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s kind of a dickish website but, like, so was Hemingway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you&amp;#39;re a content writer or blogger, you&amp;#39;d be silly not to give Hemingway a chance to pick apart your content. If nothing else, it&amp;#39;ll give you a quick look at what you&amp;#39;re not doing so well—and that kind of information can be invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wish list.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Hemingway quite a lot, but there are a few things I&amp;#39;d like to see changed/improved in future iterations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think Hemingway is designed to be a full-featured content editor, but I&amp;#39;d love to see some visual Markdown support. For example, if Hemingway had a built-in Markdown output display, I&amp;#39;d drop Mou in a heartbeat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are already hints that a desktop version is in the works, but I hope it happens soon. I just don&amp;#39;t know if I will ever be comfortable switching to an entirely web-based content editing platform. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now, the only format you can save to is .doc. And that&amp;#39;s fine to start, but I&amp;#39;d love to see some .md output with some Dropbox integration. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So how did I do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readability: Grade 8. Hemingway says to &amp;quot;Aim for a grade level less than 10 for bold, clear writing.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 of 32 sentences are hard to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 adverbs. &amp;quot;Aim for 6 or less.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 word or phrase could be simpler. &lt;/li&gt;

				<title>New gTLDs are a feast for photographers and visual artists</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-12-photographer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photographer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you scan through &lt;a href=&quot;http://dribbble.com/&quot;&gt;Dribbble&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://designspiration.net/&quot;&gt;Designspiration&lt;/a&gt; for any period of time, you&amp;#39;ll quickly discover hundreds, if not thousands, of artists and photographers with personal websites ending in .com. And that&amp;#39;s fine. Seriously. There&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with a .com name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how nice would it be to be able to count on a your photographer having a domain that ends with .photography? Or your camera shop ending in .camera? And for the artists and suppliers themselves, wouldn&amp;#39;t a more direct name in a less crowded namespace than .com make sense? Do you really want to get stuck with a 3-5 word domain name, or a domain that very loosely pertains to your branding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, there&amp;#39;s a new batch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425299-what-is-a-gtld-&quot;&gt;gTLD&lt;/a&gt; just for you, all coming February 12th at 16:00:00 UTC (pre-orders are still open, but only for a short time!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s never been a better showcase for photography than the internet, and there are countless domains out there that follow the YOURNAMEphotography.com naming convention. So why not cut the excess and move to a YOURNAME.photography domain? And since everyone knows you&amp;#39;re a photographer anyway, finding you in the .photography namespace (as opposed to guessing between .com and various ccTLDs) will be easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery&quot;&gt;.GALLERY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For owners of the physical spaces that house photography, no TLD makes more sense than .gallery. Just like .photography, it&amp;#39;s an easy way to shorten a lengthy YOURNAMEgallery.com domain name, and it does wonders in keeping people from guessing between TLDs that don&amp;#39;t pertain to your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics&quot;&gt;.GRAPHICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.graphics is less of a direct namespace replacement as .photography, but we&amp;#39;ve still seen quite a few pre-orders get creative with their branding. As you can expect, there are plenty of YOURNAME.graphics names, but there are also some pertaining to shirt designs, deck graphics and trendy styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-camera&quot;&gt;.CAMERA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-equipment&quot;&gt;.EQUIPMENT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-lighting&quot;&gt;.LIGHTING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip-side of photography, there are a number of websites dedicated to the gear. The cameras, the equipment and the lighting. And again, how much nicer would the web be if you could count on your camera shop to end in .camera, you lighting specialist to end in .LIGHTING and your equipment dealer to end in .EQUIPMENT?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Need a .GURU domain? There are tons of great ones available.</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.GURU is, without a doubt, the most popular of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html&quot;&gt;seven new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; launched this week. And one of the most popular naming conventions for .GURU is tacking it onto the end of a name, like &lt;em&gt;yourname&lt;/em&gt;.guru — because you are a guru after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with a quick little search, we found a treasure trove of open .GURU domains for both male and female first names and last names. They may get snapped up fast, so move quick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Male&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=alvin.guru&quot;&gt;alvin.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=barry.guru&quot;&gt;barry.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=bernard.guru&quot;&gt;bernard.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=bradley.guru&quot;&gt;bradley.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=brent.guru&quot;&gt;brent.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=calvin.guru&quot;&gt;calvin.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=charlie.guru&quot;&gt;charlie.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=clifford.guru&quot;&gt;clifford.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=clyde.guru&quot;&gt;clyde.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=darrell.guru&quot;&gt;darrell.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=derrick.guru&quot;&gt;derrick.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=dustin.guru&quot;&gt;dustin.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=eddie.guru&quot;&gt;eddie.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=edwin.guru&quot;&gt;edwin.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=floyd.guru&quot;&gt;floyd.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=francis.guru&quot;&gt;francis.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=francisco.guru&quot;&gt;francisco.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=frederick.guru&quot;&gt;frederick.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=glen.guru&quot;&gt;glen.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=gordon.guru&quot;&gt;gordon.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=hector.guru&quot;&gt;hector.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=herbert.guru&quot;&gt;herbert.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=jerome.guru&quot;&gt;jerome.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=kyle.guru&quot;&gt;kyle.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=leroy.guru&quot;&gt;leroy.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=lester.guru&quot;&gt;lester.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=lewis.guru&quot;&gt;lewis.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=lloyd.guru&quot;&gt;lloyd.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=marcus.guru&quot;&gt;marcus.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=mario.guru&quot;&gt;mario.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=micheal.guru&quot;&gt;micheal.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=miguel.guru&quot;&gt;miguel.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=pedro.guru&quot;&gt;pedro.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=ramon.guru&quot;&gt;ramon.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=randall.guru&quot;&gt;randall.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=ricardo.guru&quot;&gt;ricardo.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=ricky.guru&quot;&gt;ricky.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=tommy.guru&quot;&gt;tommy.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=troy.guru&quot;&gt;troy.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=vernon.guru&quot;&gt;vernon.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=vincent.guru&quot;&gt;vincent.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=wesley.guru&quot;&gt;wesley.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=zachary.guru&quot;&gt;zachary.guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The new domain extensions are here, with .GURU and .BIKE leading the way</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-06-guru.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Guru&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat log from this morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timo:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s great to see new TLDs being ordered together with traditional ones. -short pause- Traditional TLD sounds odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenz:&lt;/strong&gt; post apocalyptic TLD world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timo:&lt;/strong&gt; post .com era&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, the first of the new gTLDs officially went live, making &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.BIKE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holdings&quot;&gt;.HOLDINGS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-singles&quot;&gt;.SINGLES&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing&quot;&gt;.PLUMBING&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ventures&quot;&gt;.VENTURES&lt;/a&gt; the official firsts for the rapid expansion of the internet namespace. And while the launch isn&amp;#39;t exactly a trip to the moon, we&amp;#39;re so excited about it that a few of us didn&amp;#39;t sleep last night (Lenz&amp;#39; sleep tracker counted 2hr 31min). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as kinks go, we found a few (as expected), but things have gone rather well. Best of all, orders are going smoothly for the most part, and we&amp;#39;re learning a ton for our next launch. One specific thing we&amp;#39;ve found is that the pre-order system is still a bit vague—so we&amp;#39;ve written a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1439307-how-does-the-gtld-pre-order-process-work-&quot;&gt;support article outlining the process&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s certainly a work in progress, so if anything is still unclear, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The leader (so far)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the seven gTLDs that came out today, the clear leader in registered domains (so far) is .GURU, with more than three times the popularity of the next highest TLD, .BIKE. I suppose it makes sense though—we&amp;#39;ve always known our customers are the smartest domain buyers on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we&amp;#39;re seeing a good number of .GURU domains using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first/last name.guru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various beer/coffee interests.guru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;business/consulting terms.guru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how-to tasks.guru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Our smart folks are also starting ventures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also holding up quite well is .VENTURES. But again, where you have smart customers, you probably have some awesome startups needing names. Last names, cities and short tech-centric words have been big so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.PLUMBING, a surprising player&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising stats we&amp;#39;re seeing is that .PLUMBING domains are becoming quite popular. In what typically isn&amp;#39;t seen as an earlier tech adopter industry, some savvy plumbers are getting the first jump on the SEO goodness a .PLUMBING domain could provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Very few are holding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, .HOLDINGS is the most traditional of these new gTLDS. And traditional industries are known to transition slowly. It&amp;#39;d be nice for .HOLDINGS domains to pick up in pace, but it may take some time for companies to switch over from the more conservative .COM namespace. Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because new gTLDs are arriving doesn&amp;#39;t mean the pre-order period has stopped. Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;gTLD pre-order list&lt;/a&gt; and grab a name before it&amp;#39;s too late!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Shops categorize .CLOTHING because each item is different, so why not categorize the internet?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-05-jeans-clothing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;clothing rack&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many site owners, the dream of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; is to categorize the internet. To give each brand the chance to differentiate itself from the rest of its field, not the rest of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, the norm is to begin a site as a .COM, then potentially move to a few other TLDs like .CO and .TV to protect the brand. And that&amp;#39;s worked fine up to now, but we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re simply running out of .COM names to give out. Still in the relative infancy of the internet, we&amp;#39;ve already run out of two, three and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html&quot;&gt;four letter&lt;/a&gt; .COM domains, and it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before the five-letter combinations are gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a site discovery standpoint, where does that leave us? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;#39;re starting a clothing company called Simple, and are looking to create your first company website. Simple.com is already taken by a (wonderfully designed) US bank, so that&amp;#39;s out. SimpleBrand.com looks like a branding studio of sorts, so that&amp;#39;s out. Simpleclothing.com looks like it&amp;#39;s been grabbed by squatters, so that&amp;#39;s out. How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go? Simpleclothingforhumans.com? Who&amp;#39;s going to find that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt; TLD though, the choice is much...simpler—simple.clothing. And even if simple.clothing is taken, the competition for similar terms will be much lower, given that you won&amp;#39;t be competing with banks and production studios for names in the clothing category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecultureist.com/2013/05/09/how-many-people-use-the-internet-more-than-2-billion-infographic/&quot;&gt;more than two billion people using the internet today&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#39;s inevitable that there&amp;#39;s going to be some crossover in the use of common words and phrases for websites. That&amp;#39;s why we need these gTLDs—to make it ok for brands to segment into different industries. We need more than .COM, and if enough people make a change, we can create an internet with quite a bit more free space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fate of each TLD though lies in the democratic process. Every vote for a domain like .CLOTHING makes that TLD &lt;em&gt;that much&lt;/em&gt; more relevant to the general public. And if enough users from platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; join in to help push adoption, it&amp;#39;ll be that much more likely to get big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time next year, I truly hope the internet is a more open space, with more domains that aren&amp;#39;t forced into odd naming conventions. It&amp;#39;ll be better for all of us. But it&amp;#39;s up to you to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.TO, the domain extension for Tonga AND Toronto</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-02-04-toronto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Toronto&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/7-new-domain-extensions-are-coming-this-week.html&quot;&gt;new gTLDs coming out this week&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re happy to announce the availability of .TO on iwantmyname. .TO is the official &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425384-what-is-a-cctld-&quot;&gt;ccTLD&lt;/a&gt; of Tonga, but seems to be undergoing a renaissance of sorts. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedomains.com/2013/11/04/with-new-gtlds-coming-to-market-to-rebrands-itself-to-represent-toronto/&quot;&gt;From Michael Berkens of The Domains:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on the successful rebranding of .LA which is the ccTLD for Laos for Los Angeles , .TO which is the ccTLD for Tonga send out a press release today announcing the re-launch .TO for Toronto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Comparatively  speaking, .TO is wide open”, observed Eric Lyons, of Tonic – the .TO registry operator. “There are thousands of generic keywords and highly brandable names available for registration that are already taken under .COM or .CA”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;#39;re from Tonga or Toronto, or are just looking for a great domain hack/URL shortener, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/to-tongan-domain-name-registration-for-tonga&quot;&gt;.TO domains are available today for $99 USD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and he was also an electronic DJ, playing in clubs and festivals around New Zealand and abroad. And is currently learning to juggle, &amp;quot;just like the famous information theorist Claude Shannon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, he&amp;#39;s just a (really really smart) fun guy to be around. So say hi. He&amp;#39;s on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ferrouswheel&quot;&gt;@ferrouswheel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>7 new domain extensions are coming THIS WEEK</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of the internet, the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425299-what-is-a-gtld-&quot;&gt;gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; are finally coming. Not theoretically in a few months either—on &lt;strong&gt;February 5, 2014, 16:00:00 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, people everywhere will be able to purchase these new TLDs just as they would a .COM domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole naming convention of the internet is changing, and you can be amongst the first early adopters with one of these domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.BIKE&lt;/a&gt; for $39 USD / $49 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt; for $39 USD / $49 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt; for $39 USD / $49 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holdings&quot;&gt;.HOLDINGS&lt;/a&gt; for $69 USD / $79 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing&quot;&gt;.PLUMBING&lt;/a&gt; for $39 USD / $49 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-singles&quot;&gt;.SINGLES&lt;/a&gt; for $39 USD / $49 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ventures&quot;&gt;.VENTURES&lt;/a&gt; for $69 USD / $79 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders are still open, so if there&amp;#39;s a specific domain you&amp;#39;re after, now would be the time to get it in. Once they are open for general availability, the more generic terms are going to go fast.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Three tips for making the most of the new TLD pre-order period</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with hundreds of new Top-Level Domains (TLDs) coming out in the coming months, it&amp;#39;s inevitable that more than one person will want some specific domain names. For example, I&amp;#39;m fully aware that there will likely be a big rush to get christhedomain.doctor—but with these three tips, I&amp;#39;m ready for the launch, and hopefully you will be too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tip 1: Have a backup plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you think your domain is entirely unique, have a backup plan. Especially if you&amp;#39;re depending on this domain for personal or professional branding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that many generic keywords are being sold for premium prices through the registries directly (such as .KIWI&amp;#39;s premium domain page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dot-kiwi.com/premiumnames&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;). With a little creativity though, you should easily be able to find a similar domain with minimal search loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tip 2: Explore other &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425299-what-is-a-gtld-&quot;&gt;gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, it was easy to feel trapped with a limited selection of domain extensions. Now though, if you can&amp;#39;t get your desired .PHOTO domain, you can just go with .PHOTOS, .PHOTOGRAPHY or .PICS. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;plenty of domain extensions to choose from&lt;/a&gt;, so explore your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tip 3: Make sure you&amp;#39;re prepared&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything works out right and you get your domain, you&amp;#39;re going to need accurate account details. Please note that if you get a new card or something changes, change it in your iwantmyname account ASAP. Inaccurate details can prevent you from getting your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dear Medium, all I want is my own domain name. And some money.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-31-cxj3.png&quot; alt=&quot;cxj3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start this by saying that I totally &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; what you&amp;#39;re doing. I&amp;#39;m a writer at heart, and when I&amp;#39;m looking to start writing, this is my thought process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to write something great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish my personal site got more traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ugh, maybe I can hook into something social that looks good. I&amp;#39;ll give you anything you want if it means I&amp;#39;ll get pageviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be honest here, if every writer on the web confidently thought they could produce/create/host a polished product that would get thousands of hits, there would be no Medium. You wouldn&amp;#39;t exist. But that&amp;#39;s not the case. Writers don&amp;#39;t want to to deal with the how, they just want to write. And you let them do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s brilliant. It&amp;#39;s beautiful. But there&amp;#39;s a problem. At the end of the day, &lt;em&gt;I want to be the destination&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m sitting on so many social handles right now it hurts--I want this work to be my own. I want to know that if you go away tomorrow, my content will still have a name that people can find. I mean, these aren&amp;#39;t tiny tweets I&amp;#39;m looking to write here--they&amp;#39;re longform posts that take a bit of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another way of looking at it. medium.com/@ev probably seems really cool to Ev Williams because you&amp;#39;re his baby. You aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; baby. To me, you&amp;#39;re just another platform, and the very last thing I want is for more of my thoughts to be stuck to platform handles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a small peak as to why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1: Oh man, did you read John&amp;#39;s latest post?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 2: No! Where can I find it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1: He&amp;#39;s at @handle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 2: On Twitter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1: No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 2: Instagram?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1: No. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 2: Facebook?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person 1: No Person 2, Medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh, it&amp;#39;s just too much. I feel like I&amp;#39;m stuck with a hundred safety deposit boxes, but no house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I like you, Medium. I want to use you. Just let me plug in a little domain name. &lt;strong&gt;And maybe give me a chance to sell subscriptions to my work--writers need money too!&lt;/strong&gt; As an impatient blogger, I&amp;#39;m totally fine with your branding and style being everywhere because it looks nice--but I want to feel like some small chunk of my writing is mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. It would make a lot of people very happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love, 
Chris&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A good piece about the history/future of domains and an angry bit about Medium</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/p/88e8ca7f407c&quot;&gt;Great story about the history of domains over the last two decades from Morgan Linton:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed the memo, this is a big year for the Internet. Over a thousand new domain extensions are hitting the market which means you&amp;#39;ll start to see people branding around extensions like .XYZ, .APP, .NYC, .BUZZ, and many more. Gone are the days where owning a .COM, .NET, and .ORG meant you had locked down your brand name online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are entering a new era and before I dive into how I think the world is changing, I wanted to talk about how we got here. To do this we&amp;#39;ll need a time machine (luckily I have one) and we&amp;#39;ll need to set it for 1993...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have one beef with this article though. It&amp;#39;s a great piece about having &amp;quot;more options than ever before,&amp;quot; but it&amp;#39;s written in Medium, a platform that takes your identity down to a social handle. And the last thing I want is a future filled with walled social silos that take all financial freedom away from the content creators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium isn&amp;#39;t a gift to humanity, you guys. It&amp;#39;s a place where good writers that used to get paid by publishers and ad revenue can post their work for free (with no personal branding). The authors here get nothing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/28/medium-raises-25m-so-founder-ev-williams-doesnt-have-to-keep-funding-it-himself/&quot;&gt;Medium was given $25 million this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Friends don&#39;t let friends go without two-factor authentication</title>

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to forget. I didn&amp;#39;t have 2FA enabled for my domains at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;@iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; until reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/N_is_stolen&quot;&gt;@n_is_stolen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s story at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/mWj65ZrLKE&quot;&gt;http://t.co/mWj65ZrLKE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Eric Mill (@konklone) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/konklone/statuses/428566916580397056&quot;&gt;January 29, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our least favorite things is to hear about on the web is a security breach. You know, in a perfect world we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about these things, but the truth is that threats persist and nobody is perfectly safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are things you can do to make yourself safer though. An obvious tip is to improve your passwords (123456 isn&amp;#39;t good enough), but in addition, you should also set up two-factor authentication (2FA). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Timo wrote when we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/protect-your-domain-registrar-account-with-two-factor-authentication.html&quot;&gt;first announced 2FA in May&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;This adds an extra layer of login protection for your account to prevent third parties from accessing domains and making unauthorized changes to settings such as nameservers or DNS records.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this isn&amp;#39;t just something you should do with us, 2FA is an extra security step you should use for all your web presences. A ton of web platforms are adopting it as an extra security measure, so take advantage when you can. And if a platform you&amp;#39;re on doesn&amp;#39;t offer 2FA, ask them about it. Security is extremely important to everyone, and the more we can collectively improve security on the web, the safer we&amp;#39;ll all be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about two-factor authentication, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;definitely let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Open admission to the &quot;Cool Club&quot; and the potentially murky future of Svbtle</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-30-x7rg26fs3udzxa.png&quot; alt=&quot;x7rg26fs3udzxa.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtle.com/&quot;&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, when MG Siegler&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://massivegreatness.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Massive Greatness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blog started getting picked up by &lt;a href=&quot;http://techmeme.com/&quot;&gt;Techmeme&lt;/a&gt;. His writing wasn&amp;#39;t really any different than his usual fare (although I think this was shortly after the AOL purchase of Techcrunch, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/the-end/&quot;&gt;his soapbox was never larger&lt;/a&gt;)—but the platform he was on was kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a writer, I was used to having access to any blog platform I wanted to be on. Sure, I couldn&amp;#39;t hop on a site like Techcrunch and start blogging, but nothing could stop me from creating a Wordpress site of my own. But &lt;em&gt;Massive Greatness&lt;/em&gt; wasn&amp;#39;t on Wordpress—it was on Svbtle, and Svbtle was a beautifully minimalist platform only open to the movers and shakers of the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Svbtle/What-is-Svbtle-all-about&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a great Quora answer from Paul Scrivens from March 2012 about what Svbtle was all about&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Svbtle network, it isn&amp;#39;t so much about writing long articles or anything truly original, but being able to dive into the minds of the people that Dustin (Curtis) holds in high esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle&quot;&gt;And here&amp;#39;s a bit from Dustin himself:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this engine entirely for myself, without the intention of opening it up to other people. But since realizing that it has improved the way I think and write, I&amp;#39;ve decided to open it up to a small number of vetted bloggers. At least at first. The goal is simple: when you see the Svbtle design, you should know that the content is guaranteed to be great. Network bloggers are encouraged to keep quality high at the expense of everything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was—in my eyes—the unofficial start of the internet &amp;quot;Cool Club.&amp;quot; In one fell swoop, I realized that I didn&amp;#39;t have the clout to be on a platform. I was on the outside (but I did get an early Google+ invite! Crickets...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the Svbtle buzz started to wane. The people who were happily peering into the Svbtle tech-celebrity windows suddenly became bombarded with XOXO clips, tech conversations on Twitter and countless podcast cameos. Svbtle wasn&amp;#39;t new and cool anymore—it was clear (to me at least) that the platform needed a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone&quot;&gt;January 28th, From Dustin Curtis - Svbtle:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, we&amp;#39;ve been an exclusive platform open only to approved users. We took this initial approach because we wanted to ensure that the software worked, first of all, and that the platform was seeded with great content by seasoned and experienced authors. Now we&amp;#39;re finally ready to let more people try Svbtle. Today, we&amp;#39;re opening sign up for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s great news! Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wellllll. Sure. Now I can use it, but as &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mijustin&quot;&gt;mijustin on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; puts it, &amp;quot;Who needs this? Who is pulling out their hair looking for a new hosted publishing platform that they don&amp;#39;t control?&amp;quot; The one thing that truly differentiated Svbtle wasn&amp;#39;t its uniqueness, it was its exclusivity. As far as design goes, the blog-platform world caught up, and now it&amp;#39;s just one of the bunch. Silvrback, Roon, Squarespace, Virb, Ghost—the list of clean blog platforms goes on and on, and more seem to be created every month or so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And aside from that, where&amp;#39;s the money is going to come from? As of now, the platform is entirely free (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/1290603/facebook-is-%22deliberately-killing-privacy%22-says-schneier&quot;&gt;free is always scary&lt;/a&gt;), bolstered only by VC funding, but as of a year ago the real money was going to come from monetizing content—presumably the quality content created by his merry bunch of well-known bloggers. Dustin Curtis, the creator of Svbtle, said himself in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/08/with-funding-for-svbtle-dustin-curtis-wants-to-build-a-business-in-long-form-online-content/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch interview&lt;/a&gt; that, &amp;quot;Monetizing content, especially written content, is extremely difficult. I think Svbtle&amp;#39;s biggest innovation will be in this area, but I don&amp;#39;t know what it is yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an expected wave of new users, I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that there will be plenty of new content to leverage, but without the commitment to quality, will it be good? Is there any way Svbtle can &amp;quot;keep quality high at the expense of everything else,&amp;quot; even when the platform is completely open?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess we&amp;#39;ll see. It seems more likely to me that Svbtle will release some sort of premium service with a monthly fee, but I&amp;#39;d love for Dustin to figure out his innovative monetization scheme and keep things free for the user. Svbtle is definitely polished enough (and Dustin Curtis certainly seems creative enough) to do something exciting, but it&amp;#39;s now competing in a crowded space without an obvious plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brace yourself for a rough ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a separate note, we&amp;#39;re very happy to say that Svbtle allows you to use custom domains! As the post Svbtle post from above states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writers shouldn&amp;#39;t be defined by the brands of their publishers or platform, but rather by their own personal presence on the web. So we&amp;#39;ve built features that enable you to own your space inside Svbtle: Your full name appears by everything you write, you can use a custom domain, and you can choose an avatar and accent color. We have plans for more personalization and branding features soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in the platform (and you should be, it&amp;#39;s quite nice) and need some help setting things up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;definitely let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ICANN&#39;s new 100</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2014/01/100-new-gtlds-in-the-internet-thousands-of-new-ideas/&quot;&gt;From Akram Atallah - ICANN:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the increase in choice of available domain names, the delegation of more than 100 new gTLDs means the Internet is being reshaped as a truly global resource. The following statistics are encouraging, particularly when one considers that these are only a fraction of the potential new gTLDs (there are over 1,300 possibilities):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New gTLD Registries with delegated gTLDs are operating in nine countries, including Australia, China and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Languages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original 22 gTLDs consist of Latin characters only, and most are abbreviated English words. Examples of newly introduced languages include Arabic, Chinese, German, and Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registries for gTLDs .WIEN and .BERLIN self-identified as community applicants, signifying their intention to operate the gTLDs on behalf of the citizens of Vienna and Berlin, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Jo-John Torres, Business Development Manager of DotClub</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-24-logo-no-url-500px.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-no-url-500px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: Hi Jo-John, thanks for chatting with us! Let&amp;#39;s start with the big topic--tell us all about .club. Who do you see as the primary market for it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; We see &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&quot;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; as a mainstream, mass-market TLD, and it has already consistently been listed in the &amp;quot;Top 10&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;most popular&amp;quot; of the new TLDs by websites offering pre-registration interest and watch lists. Of all the top names, .CLUB will be the first of the most popular names to launch early in 2014. All the other top names (excluding GEOs) are still in contention or have GAC advice which may delay their launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the market for .CLUB as very broad, including clubs and membership organizations, retailers for their loyalty and affinity programs, sports teams, fan clubs, night clubs, golf, tennis and country clubs, all of the millions of social groups on Facebook, Yahoo, Google and LinkedIn, as well as anyone with a passion for something. Because of this very broad appeal, .CLUB is typically featured in several categories, such as Business, Sports, Entertainment, Social, Travel, and Generic.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the word &amp;quot;CLUB&amp;quot; hits the mainstream market throughout the whole world.  The word CLUB is spelled the same and means the same all over the world. The meaning of the word is bringing people together who share a common bond of interest and passion, which is about building communities. It&amp;#39;s your passion, your .CLUB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: We&amp;#39;re hearing a lot of talk about the launch of the new gTLDs (like .club, .blog and .app) being the start of a post-.com era. Do you think the average &amp;quot;web surfer&amp;quot; is ready for that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; We truly feel the &amp;quot;web surfers&amp;quot; of today&amp;#39;s generation are ready. Because many of the new TLDs, like .CLUB, actually are words that add meaning to whatever you put to the left of the dot, they can offer better branding identity and representation making it a better way to target their audience. Not only is it very hard to get a good .com name anymore, but what does &amp;quot;.com&amp;quot; actually mean? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new gTLDs will offer businesses and consumers a great deal of choice when it comes to finding the perfect domain name. Choice is always a good thing. .CLUB, for example, is an open, universal and global gTLD with no restrictions or special requirements for getting a name. That means that .CLUB will draw all sorts of people who belong to a large or small group or organization sharing the same bond of a common goal, interest, or passion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: We love a good domain name here at iwantmyname, and .club has a number of great domain possibilities available (chess.club was a huge hit in my younger years). Give us a few good ones people should be pining for.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; There are so many great names where the word to the right of the dot actually adds meaning and value.  Retailers can use a .CLUB name for their loyalty programs, such as Safeway.club or Admirals.club. Then, there are the social groups like the one you mentioned you were part of, Chess.club. How about people who are Poker Hobbyists like Poker.club or owners of Jeeps who have a passion to go off-road and have a club called Jeepsters.club, and of course for all of these club categories there are countless regional versions - BocaRatonChess.club, VegasPoker.club, MiamiTennis.club, and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: What does the future of .club look like? How big do you expect it to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; We expect the future of .CLUB to be very bright as there are millions of existing clubs who could use the name as well as all the other market segments we mentioned earlier. We have a high-level goal to reach 5 Million Domain Names in 5 years, and while aggressive, we feel it is attainable. We&amp;#39;re positioning .CLUB as a mainstream global brand, and we are backing that up with world-class partners and an extensive marketing campaign.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: Last but not least, given that you&amp;#39;re the experts on .club, I&amp;#39;m assuming you know your way around a bottle of club soda. Have any good club soda tips for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; You mean .CLUB Soda, our official beverage!  ... Just add some ice &amp;amp; gin or vodka and it is the perfect drink to when you visit a night.club! ;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow .CLUB on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/getDotClub&quot;&gt;@getDotClub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s so important to us, in fact, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;all of us&lt;/a&gt; dedicate a considerable amount of time to answer questions and help out. And with &lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;99% customer happiness&lt;/a&gt; over the 6+ months we&amp;#39;ve been measuring support satisfaction, we&amp;#39;d like to think we&amp;#39;ve been doing a good job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to grow and improve, we need help. Specifically, we need someone to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reply to inquiries via &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyName&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; from all over the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add to and maintain our &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;Support Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with the team to improve our overall customer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because we&amp;#39;re based in Wellington, NZ, we&amp;#39;re specifically looking for someone to take over the opposite side of the globe--EST, the east coast of North America. Or a European location if you don&amp;#39;t mind working later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re super smart, like to teach (and learn) and feel good about working in your pajamas every day (totally optional), head over to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/customer-support&quot;&gt;jobs page to find out how to apply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the image above was made with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/need-a-logo-squarespace-has-you-covered.html&quot;&gt;Squarespace Logo&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Need a logo? Squarespace has you covered.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/introducing-squarespace-logo&quot;&gt;From Anthony Casalena - Squarespace:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squarespace Logo helps anyone create a professional logo on their own. All logos are comprised of a few basic elements: text, a tagline, and an icon. With the help of The Noun Project and Google Fonts, we provide a huge array of icons (7,000 and growing!) and fonts that you can easily turn into a unique logo for your business. To give you an idea of how your logo will look, you can use our handy previews to see your new logo on a business card, a website, or a t-shirt. When you&amp;#39;re ready to download your logo, we provide white on black, black on white, and full-color images in a variety of formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started enough small web projects in my time to know that branding is the single scariest thing for any non-designer to take on. It&amp;#39;s like building a house--if you don&amp;#39;t have the knowledge or the tools, you have no chance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/logo&quot;&gt;Squarespace Logo&lt;/a&gt; gives you all the tools you need for something basic, and is so easy to use that it&amp;#39;s impossible to screw up (although even Squarespace can&amp;#39;t fix bad taste). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I made one. You know, what the hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-23-rPz7.png&quot; alt=&quot;rPz7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionality is fairly limited at this point--for instance, I couldn&amp;#39;t add a second lightning bolt or a pair of underpants to hide the shame of my logo, but I can say that it&amp;#39;s super easy to use and quite effective at accomplishing a relatively important task. Also, you don&amp;#39;t  need an account to make one. Squarespace Logo is entirely free for everyone to use, and if you love what you make, you can pay $10 for a high-res PNG (free for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace customers&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really have nothing to lose here, so give it a shot. It&amp;#39;s quite fun to play with. And seriously, you can put underpants on your logo!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s In Store For 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s looking like big year ahead for the iwantmyname crew. Apart from adding a few more staff in 2014 and getting out in the community a bit more, we are also well advanced with our preparations for the global roll-out of hundreds of newly released top level domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already been offering customers the opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;register interest in the new domains&lt;/a&gt;. On the local front, we have also been seeing increasing activity around both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-kiwimore-gtlds-coming-soon.html&quot;&gt;.kiwi domain&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/its-time-to-drop-the-conz-pre-ordering-starts-today.html&quot;&gt;second level .nz domain&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a business owner, then it&amp;#39;s time to start thinking about how these new domains fit into your brand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the technical side, we&amp;#39;ve already begun work on improving our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain name search&lt;/a&gt; function, making it easier and faster to search for your favourite domain from over 100 extensions on offer. That work opens the door for some long awaited improvements to our customer dashboard. As always, we value &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; from our mates, so we can make your domain registration experience even better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already support a lot of events and local initiatives across the New Zealand tech community, but expect to see us out and about more often this year. We&amp;#39;ve just helped to launch a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Wellington/&quot;&gt;Docker Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ll be shouting beers for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/&quot;&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Founders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/&quot;&gt;PHP Meetup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Growth Hacker Meetup&lt;/a&gt;. February is looking busy too with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Drupal South&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some noticeable changes here on our blog too, as we will be merging our New Zealand blog with the new and improved international blog shortly. But don&amp;#39;t worry, we will still be reporting local interest stories. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Small countries, big(ish) domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-19-bigstock-Adelie-Penguins-Jumping-From-I-36934342.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Adelie-Penguins-Jumping-From-I-36934342.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pando.com/2014/01/16/10-tiny-places-that-have-their-own-domain-names/&quot;&gt;From Akshat Rathi - Pando Daily:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, although there are the 206 sovereign states (of which 11 are not recognised by the United Nations), there are 255 country-code domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can go too far. For example, Heard and McDonald Islands, a dependency of Australia in the Indian Ocean, has its own top-level domain name, &amp;quot;.hm&amp;quot;, even though its population is zero, and its official website uses Antarctica&amp;#39;s top-level domain name, &amp;quot;.aq&amp;quot;. It is also not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of the Heard Islands? Or the beautiful New Zealand territory, Tokelau? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://pando.com/2014/01/16/10-tiny-places-that-have-their-own-domain-names/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; from Pando Daily to see the ten least populated regions with their own top-level domains (TLDs).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>When choosing a domain, it&#39;s you against 7+ billion</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-18-3203403780_d2878c0c82.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3203403780_d2878c0c82.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt; According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/&quot;&gt;worldometers.info&lt;/a&gt;, as of writing this post there are 7,207,045,692 people on Earth. Just this year we&amp;#39;ve added 3,732,015 people, and that number is going up every second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar rise is the world of domains. In many of our lifetimes, the internet has gone from 0 domains to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/infographic-dnib-Q32013.pdf&quot;&gt;265 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html&quot;&gt;including every four-letter .COM combination&lt;/a&gt;). Needless to say, that&amp;#39;s quite a lot. And with an estimated 77% of the developed world online at the moment, that number is getting larger and larger by the minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s most important to remember about domains is that when people register them, they often do what they can to protect their brand. That often includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COM and .NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any ccTLD that might relate to the brand, like .IO and .FM (tech favorites)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any TLD that might form a domain hack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you talk to an entrepreneurial soul, he/she might have a ton of domains--some for projects they&amp;#39;re working on, some for future projects that failed and some that just haven&amp;#39;t been around long enough to expire. I myself have 13 domains right now, and I know many people who have much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt; As a domain registrar, we get tweets like this one every once in a while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beware searching domains on @iwantmyname, got a few immediately bought out by squatters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this is a reasonable concern--if I were looking for a domain name and a corresponding domain hack and both were taken on the same day, my first reaction would probably be &amp;quot;WTF?!?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you think about it, the odds of your desired domain being entirely original isn&amp;#39;t all that great. Again, there are millions of domains registered, and more are registered every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And truth is, if someone was stalking and buying up all the domain search results that go through iwantmyname, they&amp;#39;d be broke pretty fast. There are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of searches happening, and it often takes people a few tries to pair a brand name they like with a domain they can find. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, just look at what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/2013/09/24/naming-overcast&quot;&gt;Marco Arment went through&lt;/a&gt; to finally come up with Overcast.fm as his new podcast app. Branding is hard, and now with domains being such a crucial aspect, it&amp;#39;s harder than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re so excited about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; currently being &lt;a href=&quot;http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings&quot;&gt;delegated by ICANN&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of getting bottlenecked by a relatively small number of TLDs to choose from, you&amp;#39;ll have access to hundreds of new gTLDs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your name is Fred and you&amp;#39;re opening a restaurant and can&amp;#39;t get fredsfood.com, just pick up fred.restaurant, fred.pub, fred.food or fred.eat. Some of the more common names will certainly get snapped up, but your options will be much greater. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV.&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of the day, just know that there isn&amp;#39;t a plot against you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/iwantmyname-does-not-register-domains-you-have-searched-for.html&quot;&gt;We promise that we&amp;#39;re not secretly registering domains before you do&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; unlikely that you&amp;#39;re being singled out in a very large crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you have a &amp;quot;Eureka!&amp;quot; moment and need a domain name, be really quick. As the saying goes, it&amp;#39;s you against the world...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and checking now, 277,589 people have been born today! &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This week in gTLDs, including .CHEAP, .AGENCY and .SOCIAL</title>

				<title>The internet is (finally) for everyone</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-17-ODNG.png&quot; alt=&quot;ODNG.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a native-English speaker, the internet is as easily navigable for me as going to the supermarket. Just go to my English-language browser and type in a domain with a native-character extension like .COM or .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the planet is large, and most of us weren&amp;#39;t born into English-speaking households. The alphabet I look at every day doesn&amp;#39;t even use the same characters as Cyrillic or Arabic. So how could a native Japanese speaker feel welcome on the web when domain extensions are limited to Latin characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, with the rollout of the new generic Top-Level Domains, it&amp;#39;s all changing. A number of new TLDs are set to be available soon, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%A9&quot;&gt;.شبكة&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&quot;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD&quot;&gt;.Онлайн&lt;/a&gt;. And just this week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/01/is-now-available-for-everyone.html?m=1&quot;&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA&quot;&gt;.みんな&lt;/a&gt;, the first TLD in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana&quot;&gt;hiragana&lt;/a&gt;, will be open for general availability on February 21st. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FmLnNDw23Y&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video from Google really sums up the sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl in video: (Referring to the new native domains) Wow! They all seem so nice and easy to understand! Okay, I&amp;#39;ve decided! I&amp;#39;m moving here too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why wouldn&amp;#39;t everyone? It&amp;#39;s such a practical idea for the TLDs to be native to everyone, and now it&amp;#39;s finally starting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ghost&#39;s hosted platform is live, &quot;enjoys Scotch&quot;</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-16-Ghost-Logo-on-White.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ghost-Logo-on-White.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 is looking to be a big year for Ghost, but the biggest news of all came at the tail-end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ghost.org/hosted-platform-open/&quot;&gt;From John O&amp;#39;Nolan - Ghost:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are bringing you an announcement from Ghost HQ that has been cooking for rather a long time: The Ghost Hosted Platform is now available to absolutely everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Ghost hosted platform, each blog is an independent install of the Ghost software. It&amp;#39;s not connected to any other blogs. This means that we can allow you to run apps (plugins) or custom themes or do (almost) anything you want. This was a really critical point for us, because we didn&amp;#39;t just want to create this platform as something &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; - suited to beginners. We wanted to make it easy and create the best possible infrastructure for running Ghost that&amp;#39;s available on the web. Giving publishers and developers full control over their Ghost blog is the most important piece of that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for those not familiar with how Ghost works, you can now either go with the new Ghost-hosted version, or the standard self-hosted version. Here&amp;#39;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghost hosted - With Ghost&amp;#39;s new hosting platform, they are able to provide a stable, platform-optimized experience--&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/pricing/&quot;&gt;for a price&lt;/a&gt;. Monthly prices range from $5/month for 1 blog and up to 10,000 views/month, then go all the way to millions of hits and unlimited blogs for the price of &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s talk&amp;quot; (the step down is $80/month). But remember, you&amp;#39;re paying for a very nice hosting service, and because Ghost is a non-profit, you can trust that all the money will go back into making the platform even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self hosted - Self-hosted Ghost is a lot like Wordpress.org in the fact that it&amp;#39;s totally free, provided you have some hosting space to put it on. If you&amp;#39;re looking for some nice choices, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;this is a good place to start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-4/&quot;&gt;Ghost 0.4 is out&lt;/a&gt;, giving the platform a number of handy new features. Static pages, for one, now give site owners the option to create About pages, Contact forms and any number of pages that wouldn&amp;#39;t typically appear in a normal post feed. Also, featured posts and a quick edit system makes working with posts easier than ever. Basically &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a cleaner, faster, more sophisticated Ghost all round. It enjoys Johnnie Walker Blue Label Scotch, Mozart, and the refined flavour of a premium cigar.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re ready to give Ghost a try, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; to sign up (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&quot;&gt;but don&amp;#39;t forget to grab your domain here first&lt;/a&gt;). It really is an incredible platform, and we&amp;#39;re thrilled to see it moving along as well as it has after its highly publicized &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform&quot;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2014: The Year of the generic Top-Level Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been talking about the new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) for months and months (years and years around the office), and now we&amp;#39;re here. It&amp;#39;s 2014. And in a few weeks a ton of gTLDs will be rolling out to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exact launch dates for many of the gTLDs are still up in the air, but soon we&amp;#39;ll be posting specifics on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;theresatldforthat.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, we&amp;#39;ve had a ton of new gTLDs announced for delegation (meaning they&amp;#39;ve been officially approved by ICANN) since &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/the-next-batch-of-gtlds-are-here-including-careers-photos-and-shoes.html&quot;&gt;our last post&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>Ich bin ein .BERLINer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-15-bigstock-Berlin-Germany-viewed-from-ab-52294057.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Berlin-Germany-viewed-from-ab-52294057.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recent delegation of .KIWI, another favorite of ours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;, has been officially delegated, making it the second European city after &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wien&quot;&gt;.WIEN&lt;/a&gt; to make the cut (others such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sydney&quot;&gt;.SYDNEY&lt;/a&gt; are soon to follow). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special thanks should also go out to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotberlin.de&quot;&gt;.BERLIN team&lt;/a&gt; for being one of the true pioneers of the gTLD program. With Berlin being a European tech hub with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/03/berlin-poor-sexy-silicon-valley-microsoft-google&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;2,500 tech startups, and hundreds of millions of euros in investment from some of the world&amp;#39;s biggest venture capital funds&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, we expect to see a lot of .BERLIN sites on the web in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders have already begun, so head over to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&quot;&gt;.BERLIN page&lt;/a&gt; to stake your claim on a fresh domain.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This .KIWI is ready to go global</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-14-bigstock-Kiwi-Crossing-road-sign-and-vo-35099339.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Kiwi-Crossing-road-sign-and-vo-35099339.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kiwis ourselves, we&amp;#39;re extremely excited about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s official delegation, making it the first updated Kiwi domain to hit the web. In a way, it marks a new era for the internet in New Zealand, as we expect to see .CO.NZ fall out a bit in favor of the newer, shorter alternatives. But as a lover of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi&quot;&gt;quirky bird&lt;/a&gt;, I personally hope it also gets adopted in all corners of the globe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as purchasing/pre-ordering goes, here&amp;#39;s the abridged version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of .KIWI domains will be available for the standard price at iwantmyname. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;Pre-ordering is open now&lt;/a&gt;, so get in before the Top-Level Domain officially launches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many &amp;quot;premium&amp;quot; names like airfare.kiwi and talking.kiwi, you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dot-kiwi.com/premiumnames&quot;&gt;purchase them directly through Dot Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;. Prices for some domains are on the steep side, but for some sites, unified branding is a top priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do purchase a premium .KIWI domain from Dot Kiwi, you can always &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer it to us&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of our domain management platform. Transfer prices will be announced as soon as pricing goes public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we&amp;#39;ll be sure to post more about .KIWI as we receive more information. And if you have any questions about .KIWI or the pre-ordering process, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;please let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Price reduction for .CH and .LI</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-14-bigstock-Postage-Stamp-Liechtenstein---54694160-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Postage-Stamp-Liechtenstein---54694160-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never fun to announce a price increase, but who doesn&amp;#39;t like a good price decrease? Well today we&amp;#39;re happy to announce a price reduction for two domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every word ends with .CH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that&amp;#39;s obviously an exaggeration, but if you&amp;#39;re looking for a solid domain hack, Switzerland&amp;#39;s .CH domain might be the best Top-Level Domain (TLD) out there. Just look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scrabblefinder.com/ends-with/ch/&quot;&gt;words that end in &amp;quot;ch&amp;quot; on the Scrabble Word Finder&lt;/a&gt; (possibly my favorite tool ever). Telestich. Resketch. Squelch. Or any variation of the word &amp;quot;Tech.&amp;quot; The possibilities are enormous. And now you can get one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ch-swiss-domain-name-registration-for-switzerland&quot;&gt;$24.90 USD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Liechtenstein is for .LIkers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liechtenstein may be one of the smallest countries on the planet, but its also one of the most well-to-do. But the .LI domain isn&amp;#39;t just for the local economy--it&amp;#39;s a great TLD for creative domains. Just look at brands like &lt;a href=&quot;http://paper.li&quot;&gt;paper.li&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://flow.li&quot;&gt;Flowli&lt;/a&gt; to see its potential. And now you can get your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/li-liechtensteiner-domain-name-registration-for-liechtenstein&quot;&gt;.LI domain for only $24.90 USD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Droplr 4.0 is out, and it&#39;s better than ever</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-11-mac-headline.png&quot; alt=&quot;mac-headline.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshots. File sharing. Custom link shortening. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/the-tools-we-use-droplr-for-sharing-files-and-taking-screenshots.html&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been using Droplr for months now&lt;/a&gt; as our go-to method for quickly sending files over the web, and now it&amp;#39;s been updated to version 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New in this version is a &amp;quot;completely redesigned interface,&amp;quot; with a number of speed enhancements and added features. But best of all (at least for people like us) is the addition of &lt;em&gt;Droplr for Business&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://droplr.tumblr.com/post/72887569533&quot;&gt;From the Droplr Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Droplr for Business brings all the great features that you know and love with the addition of some great team-level features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customization options that apply to your whole team. Set up a custom domain, add your logo, and modify your theme and all your team users will share this setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized billing. No longer require your team to expense their Pro account every month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team administration. Retain complete control of what and when your team is sharing. Invite new users to your team, disable or delete them when they leave, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some awesome new updates for a really handy platform, and we&amp;#39;d recommend you give it a go now more than ever. Try it out with their free 30-day trial, and if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://droplr.com/join/d/rcz960T9&quot;&gt;follow this link, you&amp;#39;ll get 10% off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why ALIAS-type DNS Records Break The Internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages&quot;&gt;GitHub announced faster, more awesome GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; recommending a new DNS setup for custom domains. In this article, I&amp;#39;ll explain the implications if you consider setting up your naked domain with a so-called ALIAS record—more about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know DNS is, by definition, a heavily cached protocol. This means that if you change a DNS record, it will take some time until everyone who knows about the record actually sees the changes. Why did the DNS industry think this was a good idea? Because DNS is an old protocol and old servers used to have downtime and connectivity issues. If your nameserver is unreachable, the DNS caching built into the specification makes sure your domain still resolves if it has been cached in a resolver along your resolution path. That is a lot of stuff to digest, so here is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-08-cache-name-res.png&quot; alt=&quot;cache-name-res.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time a DNS record is looked up at the authoritative DNS, the record gets cached in your ISPs resolver cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-08-auth-name-res.png&quot; alt=&quot;auth-name-res.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent lookups for the same record will only hit the resolver cache even if the authoritative cache is offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behaviour is important for the resilience of the DNS, and makes sure that even if things go wrong we can try to recover. The two important concepts introduced above are caching resolver versus authoritative nameserver. An authoritative nameserver always is the final authority on a DNS record and can deliver records in a predictable speed to make sure your DNS records are delivered in a fast and consistent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter the ALIAS-type record&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to point an apex or root domain to a different DNS record, as you would do to map it onto an existing service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, some providers offer something called an ALIAS record. These ALIAS-type records blur the lines between a caching resolver and an authoritative nameserver. An ALIAS record resolves on request the IP address of the destination record and serves it as if it would be the IP address for the apex domain requested. If the IP address for the destination changes, the IP address for the mapped domain changes automatically as well. This is really handy for service providers but makes every DNS provider concerned about service stability run in horror. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS records get cached, as we have seen above. So if your DNS record is cached for IP address 1.2.3.4 and the service provider changes the record to 5.6.7.8, you will send traffic for your mapped apex domain to the wrong address until the record expires in all caching resolvers. This depends on how well your ISP sticks to the protocol and can take up to a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also potentially break geoIP optimisations because suddenly you request the IP address from the nameserver of your DNS provider, not from your actual location. This may even get you in trouble with location restricted services (think Unblock-Us, just not in an intended way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There is no official industry standard yet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNAME-like functionality on the zone apex has no formal specification and a very small backing in the industry that can only be called experimental at this stage. While we fully support experimental new approaches for many things, DNS and our customers connectivity for their domains is not one of them. We believe that DNS needs to be rock solid and reliable no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right way of doing it is to accept that a root domain mapped onto another service either needs an IP address to point to or an HTTP redirect to a &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; subdomain that can be pointed to your destination via CNAME. As long as there is no official DNS industry standard, embrace your &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; subdomain and do not use aforementioned ALIAS-type records. It breaks the internet!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Happy 10th, Squarespace</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-07-squarespace-logo-horizontal-black.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;squarespace-logo-horizontal-black.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/ten-years&quot;&gt;From Anthony Casalena - Squarespace Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology shapes everything we experience on a day-to-day basis. We would not have photographs to put online if cameras were never invented. We would not have words to share unless we had language and books. We would not have these ideas merging together into websites without the invention of computers and the Internet. All of these components are building blocks that we as people can stand on to reach bigger things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is part of this bigger idea: Everyone is a creator. As a company, we make tools that help all of us put our ideas into the world. We&amp;#39;re only ten years into these efforts. It&amp;#39;s a scale of challenge that can be pursued for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; is easily one of the biggest names in web publishing at the moment, but in the fast-paced world of tech, it&amp;#39;s quite refreshing to remember how long they&amp;#39;ve been at it. Since 2004, Squarespace has been delivering professional-level publishing tools that easily rival the look and feel of well-made custom sites. And since the launch of Squarespace 6 in July 2012, the platform has grown exponentially. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business sites. Online payments. Customizable, responsive layouts. Podcasting support. Squarespace has just about anything any site could ever need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a celebration of our tenth birthday, we have ten announcements that we&amp;#39;ll be making in January. Today we&amp;#39;re pleased to present this post on our newly redesigned blog. Thank you for taking this journey with us, and stay tuned for our most exciting and impactful year ever.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Happy New Year! It&#39;s time for January domain sales.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-03-bigstock-Year---handwritten-on-the-s-47541919.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Year---handwritten-on-the-s-47541919.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 is finally here, and with it comes a bundle of resolutions bound to be broken by Spring (I seriously don&amp;#39;t think my &amp;quot;cut down on dessert&amp;quot; thing will last very long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if your resolution is to start a new website, we&amp;#39;ve got your back. In addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&quot;&gt;continuing our sale&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; ($49, $19.90 and $15.50 respectively), we have two additional extensions that might be perfect for what you&amp;#39;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Canada. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/25958&quot;&gt;most polite country&lt;/a&gt; on Earth, and perhaps the future birthplace of your next domain. .CA domains are fantastic for businesses and personal sites in Canada, and can make for great domain hacks if you&amp;#39;re feeling clever. Something like colderameri.CA or delicioustapio.CA might do the trick. Or perhaps you&amp;#39;re starting a fan club for the movie Casablan.CA? Either way, .CA domains are on sale this month for $15.50, down from $19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia&quot;&gt;.ASIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - .ASIA is an interesting generic domain extension because it fully spells out a place. And with Asia already being one of the most popular search keywords on the web, having a .ASIA address might be your ticket to enhanced visibility. Grab yours this month for $15.50, down from $24.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from all of us here at iwantmyname, we hope you had a wonderful New Year. Here&amp;#39;s to 2014 being the best year yet.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How do I connect my domain to a hosting account?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; are great for getting clean, well-designed sites on the web, but at the end of the day your website is being hosted on servers you have little-to-no access to. For most, this is no big deal, but for site owners who want a bit more control, there&amp;#39;s nothing more satisfying (and useful) than getting some &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;hosting space&lt;/a&gt; and setting up something that&amp;#39;s all your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once you get your space, the most important next step is to setup your domain name. Here&amp;#39;s how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect your iwantmyname domain to a hosting account, all you need to do on our end is change your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nameservers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to your desired host. For this example we&amp;#39;ll use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Site5 Hosting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but you&amp;#39;ll quickly see how easy it is to change your nameservers to any host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you do anything on our end, it is necessary to add your domain in your hosting account first. This will ensure the process will go smoothly once the nameserver changes are made at iwantmyname. If you&amp;#39;re unsure of how to do this, instructions can typically be found on your hosts&amp;#39; support page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Login to your account at iwantmyname and select &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the main navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-03-Screen_Shot_2014-01-03_at_11.38.23.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2014-01-03 at 11.38.23.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the next screen, select &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update nameservers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; next to your desired domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, your nameservers will be set to iwantmyname. With these settings, you can perform one-click installs for any of the apps in our marketplace, but with self-hosting, you&amp;#39;ll be moving your DNS management to your new host. To do this, click the dropdown menu labelled &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Popular settings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and select your host. For this example, we&amp;#39;re going to select Site5 Hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2014-01-03-Screen_Shot_2014-01-03_at_10.32.39.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2014-01-03 at 10.32.39.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your host is not on the list, select &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have my own nameservers...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the list and input the records provided by your host. Also, when changing from the iwantmyname nameservers, make sure any excess iwantmyname information is deleted from Nameserver 3 and Nameserver 4. Mixing custom host nameservers with iwantmyname nameservers can have odd results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that your nameservers are changed, click the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update nameservers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; button to complete the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​Once this process has been completed, it often takes a few hours for the nameserver changes to go through. If you are unsure of your nameserver changes, or if they have not gone through within 48 hours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;please send us a message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, please note that once your nameservers have been changed, all further DNS management will move to your hosting provider. You will not be able to make any changes to A, CNAME or MX records in your iwantmyname dashboard any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ICANN&#39;s new rules for domain registrants require you to verify your contact details</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Rules. You can&amp;#39;t live with them, you can&amp;#39;t have a domain without them. And starting January 2014, there are some &lt;strong&gt;important new rules to be aware of&lt;/strong&gt;. These rules are set by the internet&amp;#39;s governing body ICANN and affect all generic top-level domains (gTLDs) such as .COM, .NET, .ORG, .BIZ, .INFO or .NAME as well as upcoming new gTLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Domains will be disabled, if you don&amp;#39;t verify them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting next week, when you register a domain with new contact details, transfer existing domains or change the registrant (owner) or email address on your contact information, you will receive an additional email with an activation link. &lt;strong&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t press this link, your domain will be disabled after 15 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to verify your contact details if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchase a domain with iwantmyname for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have updated your iwantmyname account details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transferred a domain to iwantmyname and changed the contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I repeat, if you don&amp;#39;t react to these emails, new ICANN policies mandate that we will have to disable your domain name. Even if you&amp;#39;re in Antarctica and have no internet access. Even if your spam folder eats it alive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, if your 15 day verification window passes, your website will be replaced by a website displaying a verification error, along with instructions on how to fix it. But on the plus side, it can be fixed. And if you do renew it on time, this domain email verification will only happen once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So what should you do now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you are able, please ensure that your domain name is associated with a valid email address. The last thing we want is for you to make a change, then have your verification email sent to an old address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you purchase a domain or make a change after January 2014 and don&amp;#39;t receive an email, or if you just have questions about the new ICANN rules, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New Domain Extensions Added In 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We thought it would be fitting for the last post of 2013 to reflect on the top-level domains (TLDs) that have joined the iwantmyname family this year. So without further ado and in chronological order, here we go: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/02/greece-is-the-word-gr-rebuilds.html&quot;&gt;.GR&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek top-level domain is the most popular choice in the South European country and also makes for neat &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-greek-domain-name-registration-for-greece&quot;&gt;domain hacks of words ending in &amp;#39;gr&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/o-canada-your-home-and-native-domain-yes-we-do-offer-ca-now.html&quot;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a long time in the making but we&amp;#39;re very proud to introduce the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;Canadian top-level domain .CA at iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;! It is now available for registration at an affordable $19 USD/yr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/pw-domains-now-available.html&quot;&gt;.PW&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now enabled support for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pw-palauan-domain-name-registration-for-palau&quot;&gt;.PW suffix&lt;/a&gt; which is the official country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Palau. The sovereign nation is located in the Pacific Ocean and part of the the island group of Micronesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/going-across-the-ditch-you-can-now-register-au-domains-at-your-favourite-registrar.html&quot;&gt;(.COM).AU&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being based in New Zealand, it was always on our roadmap to offer the top-level domain (TLD) of our Australian friends. We know that many of you have been waiting for this TLD since a very long time and it&amp;#39;s our absolute pleasure to finally be able to announce the addition of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.COM.AU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.NET.AU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.ORG.AU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/id.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.ID.AU&lt;/a&gt; extensions to our domain family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/comar-a-tld-lionel-messi-would-be-proud-of.html&quot;&gt;(.COM).AR&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making up nearly all of southern South America, Argentina is an amazing cultural treasure, known for great soccer (fútbol), proud gauchos, some of the best beef and wine on Earth, and beautiful cities filled with European-inspired architecture. And now you can own a piece of Argentina with our newest domain extension--&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.ar-argentinean-domain-name-registration-for-argentina&quot;&gt;.COM.AR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/its-time-to-claim-a-chilean-domain.html&quot;&gt;.CL&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk a bit about Chile, home of our newest ccTLD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cl-chilean-domain-name-registration-for-chile&quot;&gt;.CL&lt;/a&gt;. Hugging the western coast of South America, Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, known for towering mountains, stunning fjords and some of the best wine on the planet. (It&amp;#39;s also the fictional home of Gus Fring, but I&amp;#39;m sure they don&amp;#39;t advertise it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/my-new-malaysian-domain-extension.html&quot;&gt;.MY&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you can own a small bit of Malaysia yourself with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/my-malaysian-domain-name-registration-for-malaysia&quot;&gt;.MY domain name&lt;/a&gt;, perfect for local businesses, organizations and anyone with a great .MY domain hack up their sleeves (wham.my, anyone?). Get yours today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t wait to add more top-level domains in 2014 and with dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new generic TLDs&lt;/a&gt; launching throughout the year (or countries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/uk-domains-without-the-co-coming-summer-2014.html&quot;&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and New Zealand &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/its-time-to-drop-the-conz-pre-ordering-starts-today.html&quot;&gt;dropping the &amp;#39;.co&amp;#39; part&lt;/a&gt;), it will certainly be busy around the iwantmyname office. But now let&amp;#39;s kick back and relax for a day or two first. Have a happy New Years everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Ten Biggest Posts Of 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always an interesting task to go back and look at your highest performing posts of the year. In just a quick glance, you can see what posts your audience likes to read, what kind of content works best, and even how well different types of headlines perform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because 2014 is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to write up the top posts you all - the readers - have been clicking on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&quot;&gt;How To Get A Custom Email Address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, when you buy a domain through iwantmyname, creating a custom email address is just like creating a website. You have to pick a platform, then install your custom domain to it. For example, if &amp;quot;The Dude&amp;quot;--owner of theinternet.io (likely not the name of the real owner)--wanted to setup a custom email address, he could search through the email hosts in our app marketplace and pick the one that suits him best. Each of them will let him email from thedude@theinternet.com, but each will also provide a slightly different set of features for a range of prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/new-blogging-platforms-that-launched-in-2013-so-far.html&quot;&gt;4 New Blogging Platforms Launched In 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, we&amp;#39;re almost halfway through 2013 already and there&amp;#39;s already been a bunch of crazy stuff happening in the blogging world. Not only has Yahoo! purchased Tumblr, a bunch of new competitors have entered the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/io-domains-now-more-awesome.html&quot;&gt;.IO Domains Now Even More Awesome For Startups!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for .io domain lovers: the popular domain for internet startups and personal sites is now seen as a generic country code top-level domain or short &amp;quot;gccTLD&amp;quot; by Google. This means you can target your site at a specific geographical audience such as the USA or UK in Google Webmaster Tools. We&amp;#39;ve been advocating for this change since last year and are happy the search engine giant finally listened. Thank you for that Google!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/prefer-to-own-your-data-here-are-some-alternatives-to-google-analytics.html&quot;&gt;Prefer to own your data? Here are some alternatives to Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics has become somewhat of the tool of choice for most people who run their own website. After all, it&amp;#39;s free, and what&amp;#39;s better than free, right? You&amp;#39;re always giving something in exchange for Google offering a service for &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; and in this case, that&amp;#39;s data on your website. There are some great alternatives out there that many aren&amp;#39;t aware of so we&amp;#39;ve made a short roundup of the ones we liked most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 250 million domain names currently registered globally, you may be wondering just why there&amp;#39;s a need for more internet real estate in the form of newly announced top level domains (TLDs). But let&amp;#39;s put that number in perspective. There&amp;#39;s already around 2.4 billion internet users now and that number continues to expand rapidly. The cost for individual users to create a personal presence on the web is dropping all the time as the cost of hosting has become a commodity and the quality of online website builder services has improved markedly. So it&amp;#39;s a safe bet a lot more people out there will be needing a web address in the future. There&amp;#39;s still plenty of room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is amazing news, as we&amp;#39;ll soon be seeing more and more gTLDs (i.e. generic domain extensions like .blog and .music) roll out to the public. You can already subscribe to updates on the above mentioned top-level domains .онлайн, .сайт, .شبكة, .游戏 - we will notify as soon as further information about final launch dates and pricing comes to hand. For a more complete list of the gTLDs coming out, check out theresatldforthat.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we found a great post by Bryan Kennedy on the things he spends the first five minutes doing on any new Linux server. We won&amp;#39;t copy the content, but in essence it&amp;#39;s a series of applications and tasks to run that allow you to be a safer system administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission at iwantmyname is to make it as easy as possible to register and set up your own domain name. The apps and services marketplace also lists lots of hosted apps for all types from individuals to businesses. We&amp;#39;ve handpicked a few of them that are especially suited for writers who want to have more control over their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to now offer two-step authentication for all iwantmyname accounts! This adds an extra layer of login protection for your account to prevent third parties from accessing domains and making unauthorized changes to settings such as nameservers or DNS records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>KPMG Is Moving From .COM To .KPMG</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-30-KPMG.png&quot; alt=&quot;KPMG.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldipreview.com/article/kpmg-migrating-from-com&quot;&gt;From WIPR:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As the primary signal for our brand&amp;#39;s Internet addressing, .kpmg will replace kpmg.com,&amp;quot; explains David Green, head of global digital marketing at the firm, which operates in more than 155 countries and employs close to 155,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The time it takes to get to that stage will depend on general public awareness of the gTLD programme,&amp;quot; Green notes. &amp;quot;We won&amp;#39;t immediately drop .com; there will be a phased migration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPMG&amp;#39;s application states that the .kpmg domain will act as a &amp;quot;clear signpost&amp;quot; for Internet users to genuine KPMG domains and associated content. &amp;quot;It will therefore increase consumer and client trust and reduce the possibility of malicious conduct. It may also allow us to engage with Internet users in their native language, creating a more positive user experience,&amp;quot; the application states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve written quite a bit about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-guru-clothing-gallery-graphics-and-more.html&quot;&gt;generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) categorizing the web&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first example of a major corporation making the switch. And what a switch it is, as KPMG is one of the world&amp;#39;s largest tax and advisory firms with nearly 155,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, a number of large companies who have applied for custom gTLDs will have URLs you can trust to be legitimate. For the average consumer, the .KPMG switch won&amp;#39;t be noticed, but imagine having trusted bank TLDs like .CHASE in America and .ANZ here in New Zealand. In one stroke, consumers will instantly be able to identify illegitimate sites, emails and mailers from their domain extensions alone. Simply for fraud detection, this is a big win for the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But categorizing the web doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily take a custom-branded TLD--there are hundreds of new gTLDs rolling out in 2014 we can all use such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-doctor&quot;&gt;.DOCTOR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-radio&quot;&gt;.RADIO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;Pre-orders are open now&lt;/a&gt;, so get your name on the list before the gTLDs officially go live.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.CX, .TL Price Increase And An Article About Harry Houdini</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never good news to hear that prices for anything are going up, but the domain registry &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocca.org.nz&quot;&gt;CoCCA&lt;/a&gt; has announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cx-domain-name-registration-for-christmas-island&quot;&gt;.CX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste&quot;&gt;.TL&lt;/a&gt; domains will be increasing in price starting January 2014. Adjusted for the new registry price, .CX and .TL domains will now cost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$119 for new registrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$79 for renewals, transfers and restores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make up for the bad news though, take a look at the greatest spoiler of all time - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.modernmechanix.com/exposing-houdinis-tricks-of-magic/&quot;&gt;Exposing Houdini&amp;#39;s Tricks of Magic by R.D. Adams in 1929&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s quite an entertaining read.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2013 A Year Of Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-23-pohu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pohu.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did 2013 go? The year in which we celebrated our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/happy-5th-birthday-iwantmyname.html&quot;&gt;5th birthday&lt;/a&gt; seems to have flown by at break-neck speed. Perhaps this is partly because we were gripped by astonishing world events both good and bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand we were shocked by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-disaster-help-if-you-can.html&quot;&gt;cyclone disaster&lt;/a&gt; that overtook the Philippines and galvanised nations into action throughout the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, we were excited by the bloom of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/the-next-batch-of-gtlds-are-here-including-careers-photos-and-shoes.html&quot;&gt;new top level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) that have finally been approved by internet governing body ICANN and for which we have begun to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a year in which we increased our engagement in the local community through initiatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/2013/12/18/the-twelve-gifts-of-christmas-startup-weekend-edition/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/rails-girls-rally.html&quot;&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/kiwi-code-retreat---advancing-the-art-of-coding-software.html&quot;&gt;Kiwi Code Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. That involvement looks set to continue early in 2014 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Drupal South&lt;/a&gt; headlining in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in the Philippines led to us to bringing forward our long held plans to contribute a portion of our sales revenue to social causes. What more deserving beneficiary could there be in 2013? We &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&quot;&gt;selected&lt;/a&gt; Save The Children&amp;#39;s Philippines fund to support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global economy also showed some signs of improvement this year and we responded by adding our first U.S. based employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/chris-hall-is-a-writer.html&quot;&gt;Chris Hall&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#39;s being doing an outstanding job delivering high value web content that gets us noticed in the world. If you want to keep up with the latest in tech tips and updates on the domain name business, be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;international blog&lt;/a&gt; channel. It seems our promotional efforts and rising international reputation did not go unnoticed - in 2013 we even got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/technology/personaltech/planting-your-flag-on-a-patch-of-the-web.html&quot;&gt;nice mention in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the home front, the New Zealand registry began marketing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;new .nz domain&lt;/a&gt; after a hurry up from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/kiwi-domain-ready-to-fly.html&quot;&gt;.kiwi&lt;/a&gt; which got the nod from ICANN earlier in the year. We are expecting 2014 to be just as busy with more gTLDs in the pipeline plus more development to make iwantmyname even better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best wishes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;the iwantmyname crew&lt;/a&gt;, thanks for supporting us this year and have a safe and happy Christmas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t Rent. Own Your Place On The Web</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2013/12/19/consider-investing-digital-real-estate/&quot;&gt;From Olle Lindholm - The Next Web:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: It&amp;#39;s not a good idea to build your entire business on someone else&amp;#39;s land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyblogger calls this practice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/digital-sharecropping/&quot;&gt;digital sharecropping&lt;/a&gt;, and it works in a similar fashion to the the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism&quot;&gt;feudal system&lt;/a&gt;, where the landlords reap the rewards, and the peasants do all the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know which empires will stand strong in the future. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn change their terms and conditions on a regular basis, and as tenants, we don&amp;#39;t know what they have in store for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why not buy your own digital land and start creating your online assets right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting analogy - rent vs. own - one that most people don&amp;#39;t think about when they&amp;#39;re on the web. Just look at the platforms people are hosting their online identities on today. Facebook and LinkedIn, and even Medium. What would happen if they became completely paid platforms? Or completely fell out of favor? Even if you could export your content out, would you be ok with your identity losing all its SEO? Or losing all those comments and likes that make your online presence seem alive? When you&amp;#39;re not the owner of your space, you really have no say.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: StatusPage.io For Our Website Status</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-20-logo_on_light-e4882f38fa3ad197957d9a0614dda117.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo_on_light-e4882f38fa3ad197957d9a0614dda117.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing worse than visiting a site that&amp;#39;s not running correctly is being responsible for it. But the inevitable truth is that things go wrong sometimes. And when they do, it&amp;#39;s important to be transparent with your customers and always keep them informed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s why we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statuspage.io&quot;&gt;StatusPage.io&lt;/a&gt; for site status updates. Using StatusPage.io, we&amp;#39;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://status.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;branded status page&lt;/a&gt; to inform our customers of errors/outages in different parts of our site (website, domain search, customer dashboard, DNS hosting and order processing). With built-in automated Twitter integration, StatusPage.io also acts as a secondary status platform when up-to-the-minute messaging is critical to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes StatusPage.io even more helpful though is its integration with our internal chat app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt;. With native HipChat integration, everyone at iwantmyname receives status updates when things go wrong, so we&amp;#39;re always on the same page with community management and workflow. And as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hipchat.com/2013/12/04/integrate-statuspage-io-with-hipchat/&quot;&gt;HipChat post announcing the integration&lt;/a&gt; suggests, &amp;quot;Now, everyone in the company can stay up-to-date during an unplanned outage or scheduled maintenance without interrupting the engineers who are working to restore services.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re interested in how our site is performing, check out out page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://status.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;status.iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re extremely happy with our new status setup and would certainly recommend StatusPage.io to any service-based company with a web platform.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Google Webmaster Help Answers So Many Search Related Questions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We get asked fairly often about getting sites to rank in Google search, and we usually answer with a quick rundown of SEO best practices--but sometimes it&amp;#39;s best to get the information from the source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleWebmasterHelp/videos&quot;&gt;Google Webmaster Help YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful resource for search related questions, and is delivered in easily consumable &amp;lt;15 minute videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few to get a taste:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Comprehensive Look At What You Can Do With GitHub Pages</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://konklone.com/post/the-power-and-potential-of-github-pages&quot;&gt;From Eric Mill - konklone.com:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent days, my usage of Github Pages has drastically increased. It&amp;#39;s an incredibly useful way to get things online for free, and since it&amp;#39;s part of a developer-friendly platform, you can repurpose it for all sorts of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve stretched Github Pages pretty far, and so I thought it&amp;#39;d be helpful to describe the different ways I&amp;#39;ve found it valuable in my personal and professional work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing a dynamic, nice-looking document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly getting files online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving a simple home to a working community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a simple data hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a sophisticated data hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, its original purpose: project documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re at all interested in the GitHub Pages platform, this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/konklone&quot;&gt;Eric Mill&lt;/a&gt; - coming in at nearly 2,000 words - is quite possibly the best writeup you&amp;#39;ll ever find on its capabilities, limitations and potential future. And as Eric says, &amp;quot;if it&amp;#39;s not obvious, I think Github Pages&amp;#39; potential is huge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Next Batch Of gTLDs Are Here, Including .CAREERS, .PHOTOS And .RECIPES</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-19-bigstock-Spices-and-old-recipe-book-on--50467688.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Spices-and-old-recipe-book-on--50467688.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 2014 quickly approaching, ICANN has been busy delegating generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs). Just this week, 17 new gTLDs have been delegated--the most we&amp;#39;ve seen in a single batch yet. And as we get into the new year, we&amp;#39;ll be seeing more and more delegations. But let&amp;#39;s not get impatient. This new batch of gTLDs has a lot to offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-careers&quot;&gt;.CAREERS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company&quot;&gt;.COMPANY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-management&quot;&gt;.MANAGEMENT&lt;/a&gt; for business-minded folks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cab&quot;&gt;.CAB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-limo&quot;&gt;.LIMO&lt;/a&gt; for getting around town. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-academy&quot;&gt;.ACADEMY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-camp&quot;&gt;.CAMP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center&quot;&gt;.CENTER&lt;/a&gt; for education. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-computer&quot;&gt;.COMPUTER&lt;/a&gt;, .DOMAINS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-systems&quot;&gt;.SYSTEMS&lt;/a&gt; for tech. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos&quot;&gt;.PHOTOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-recipes&quot;&gt;.RECIPES&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shoes&quot;&gt;.SHOES&lt;/a&gt; for just about everyone else. We even have some great foreign language options in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-viajes&quot;&gt;.VIAJES&lt;/a&gt; and .公益.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once specific launch dates are announced, we&amp;#39;ll definitely let you know--but don&amp;#39;t forget that you can pre-order them now to get your name on the list. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;check our our newly updated gTLD page&lt;/a&gt;, with pre-order links to all 481 domain extensions we have listed. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Now Is A Great Time To Start Using GitHub Pages</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-18-Screen_Shot_2013-12-17_at_23.06.23.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-17 at 23.06.23.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-developers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/dont-be-scared-of-github-pages.html&quot;&gt;nothing is more intimidating&lt;/a&gt; than stepping into the world of GitHub repositories. It seems like you could commit an infinite amount of time to learning various programming languages and still not get to where using GitHub makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now it&amp;#39;s easier than ever to inch your way into the ecosystem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/1719-github-pages-just-got-easier&quot;&gt;From GitHub:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;pages.github.com&lt;/a&gt; will walk you through the steps of publishing your first site in minutes, whether it&amp;#39;s via Git for command line, GitHub for Windows, or GitHub for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GitHub Pages veterans, we&amp;#39;ve also taken the opportunity to surface some great GitHub Pages resources to learn how to take advantage of the Jekyll templating engine, for example, or how to set up a custom domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re ready to make the leap (and I think you definitely are), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;grab your domain name&lt;/a&gt; and start creating your very own static HTML5, CSS or JavaScript page with GitHub Pages today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SEO And The New Domain Extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, determining how websites rank on search engines like Google probably seems like pure voodoo magic. But in reality, there&amp;#39;s a whole industry dedicated to helping businesses and individuals boost their search ranks--search engine optimization (SEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of SEO, Moz (previously SEO Moz) is probably the top resource for the best practices and trends. And with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs coming soon&lt;/a&gt;, they have some interesting things to say about how the new domain extensions will affect SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com/blog/next-domain-gold-rush&quot;&gt;From The Moz Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, as a Moz reader, you may be wondering what weight the new TLDs will have with search engines. Will a domain like seattle.attorney have the same ranking benefit as a more traditional domain like seattleattorney.com? Google&amp;#39;s Matt Cutts has stated that the new TLDs won&amp;#39;t have an advantage over existing domains, but was unclear on whether keywords in the new domain extensions will act as a ranking signal. I strongly suspect they will play this by ear, until they know how each of the new TLDs is being used. In my opinion, exact-match domains are no longer as powerful without other signals to back them up, and it&amp;#39;s likely Google may lower the volume on some of the new TLDs or treat them more like sub-domains in terms of ranking power. In other words, they&amp;#39;ll probably have some value, but don&amp;#39;t expect miracles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be indirect SEO benefits. For example, if you own seattle.attorney, it&amp;#39;s more likely people will link to you with the phrase &amp;quot;Seattle attorney&amp;quot;, and since that&amp;#39;s now your brand/domain, it&amp;#39;s more likely to look natural (because it&amp;#39;s more likely to be natural). A well-matched name may also be more memorable, in some cases, although it may take people some time to get used to the new TLDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>An Interview About .NZ With Patrick Watson, DNCL Communications Advisor</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-13-DNClogo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;DNClogo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a New Zealand-based domain registrar, it&amp;#39;s no secret that we have a soft spot for our domestic domains. And with .NZ coming out soon, we reached out to Patrick Watson of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnc.org.nz&quot;&gt;Domain Name Commission Ltd (DNCL)&lt;/a&gt; to get all the details about the upcoming launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally competition is seen as a good thing, but how do you expect the New Zealand domain market to change once .NZ and .KIWI are both live? Which will capture the local imagination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition has always existed in the .nz domain name space and so .kiwi&amp;#39;s entrance into the market isn&amp;#39;t anything new. In fact, we welcome the competition. Looking into the future, no one can really predict how the public will see .kiwi in relation to .nz or what will happen in New Zealand&amp;#39;s domain name market.  This is particularly true against the backdrop of all the other gTLDs that will be rolled out over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we believe people get domain names that seem most relevant to them and speak to their unique identity or purpose. How they come to this decision is entirely their own, but the Domain Name Commission urges people to make informed decisions, do their own research, and
see what makes sense to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all this, last year a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getyourselfonline.co.nz/sites/default/files/nzrs_report_FINAL_v2_0_0.pdf&quot;&gt;Colmar Brunton survey&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,001 people and 517 business people. This was before the .kiwi launch. From this research it was found that New Zealand consumers much preferred .nz websites to .com ones and that both New Zealand businesses and consumers perceived .nz as local, friendly, trusted and
familiar. We also found consumers preferred to use .nz websites over .com ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all these factors we are sure .nz domain names will stay appealing and relevant, even with .kiwi in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the growth expectations for .NZ? And how long to you think it&amp;#39;ll take it to take over .CO.NZ in the everyday lexicon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; It is difficult to predict how consumers will respond to registrations directly at the second level, how they&amp;#39;ll casually speak about it, or how the marketplace will react. If you studied how all .nz second levels performed when first introduced, you&amp;#39;d find all types of trends. Similarly .nz registrations directly at the second level will follow their own natural course as dictated by market forces and consumer behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of overall .nz growth, which includes all second levels, the .nz domain name space has doubled in size over the last six years. And, in the 2012-2013 financial year, the .nz space experienced a 10.16% growth from the year before.  At the very minimum, DNCL expects these growth trends to remain.  Given the significance of allowing registrations directly at the second level, though, our gut feeling is that .nz growth will increase more than typical in the short term following this decision. As we also believe there is still an important place for second levels within the .nz domain name space, we simultaneously think that they too will grow with time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnc.org.nz/content/fy_stats.html&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to all of the DNCL&amp;#39;s statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So what happens to existing .CO.NZ domains now? Will there be a grandfathering period? Priority registration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that no change will be made to existing second levels - all existing domain names will continue to be available, and people will still be able to register new domain names in second level categories like .co.nz, .org.nz, etc. DNCL will also continue to expand the choice of second levels as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2014, a final policy implementing the proposal will be subject to public consultation and it will explain in detail what will happen to existing .nz registrants. What is unlikely to change is what is explained in our existing &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnc.org.nz/faq-registrations-directly-second-level?m=635&quot;&gt;FAQ section&lt;/a&gt;, which states that anyone who held a .nz domain name prior to 9am on 30 May 2012 will have access, or be eligible to, some sort of preferential registration. They will fit into two categories: Competing Registrants and Non-Competing Registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Registrant got their domain name before 9am on Wednesday 30 May, 2012, and no one else registered that same name in another second level category before this date, they are non-competing Registrants. Those who fall into this category will be informed of this. These people will be given the option to register their name in a preferential registration period, or reserve their name for up to two years at no charge. DNCL research shows that over 90% of existing names are in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If two or more Registrants registered a domain name under different second levels - and they did so before 9am on Wednesday 30 May, 2012 - they will be considered a &amp;#39;Competing Registrant&amp;#39;. An example of this would be one person having anyname.co.nz and a second person having anyname.net.nz. Anyone who falls into this category will be informed of this fact. Without going into too much detail, these people would either get consent from the other registrants and register their
domain name at the second level or give up their rights to it altogether. Please note that even if they give up their rights to their name at the second level, they will continue to be able to use their existing .nz domain name. If no agreement can be reached and the
name remains conflicted, then no one will be able to register it. Our research shows less than 10% of names fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, though, the final consultation policy - which will outline what will happen to all .nz registrants - won&amp;#39;t happen until early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people not in the industry probably wonder why .NZ didn&amp;#39;t exist from the start--it seems to a far superior TLD than .CO.NZ. Can you talk us through that history a bit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; The background to the .nz domain name space stems from when Waikato University ran the .nz domain name space. In fact, in the early days a consortium of universities made decisions around the structure of .nz.  Later, InternetNZ entered into an arrangement with ICANN to hold delegation over the .nz domain name space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of other countries at the time, registrations at the third level were common practice and had precedents in other email addressing systems in operation at the time in the UK and Europe. Our understanding is that the original hierarchical structure was intended to differentiate the ccTLDs from the gTLDs such as .com and other ones
around at the time. In the years that have passed, however, things have changed. Indeed, a number of other countries have also changed their policies to allow registrations directly at the second level and New Zealand&amp;#39;s doing the same will introduce a format to .nz that is common with many other ccTLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, it easy to look back and think about how improvements might have been made.  Armed with this knowledge, if we were starting today we probably would do things differently. For
open registrations we probably would have allowed registrations at the second level from day one. However, we also believe there is a place for moderated spaces like .govt and .health and we would keep this policy for similarly appropriate bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the changes we&amp;#39;re making today we think we are offering the best of both worlds and that allowing registrations at the second and third level will allow people to identify with existing second levels or dissociate with them if they don&amp;#39;t. For example, businesses can still identify themselves as a company by using .co.nz and oganisations can do the same with .org.nz. However if you&amp;#39;re neither of these things - and no other second level speaks to you - you could go straight to registering at the second level. From our perspective, this approach offers more choice and benefits to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And finally, aside from launching .NZ, tell us more about what DNC does and how it is different from NZRS and InternetNZ. What are the big issues of today and tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; InternetNZ (Internet New Zealand Inc) manages the .nz domain name space and established two subsidiary companies, Domain Name Commission Ltd (DNCL) and NZ Domain Name Registry Ltd (NZRS), to carry out the
management and day-to-day operations. This leaves the InternetNZ Council to maintain a governance overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNCL is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the .nz domain name registration and management system.  NZRS is responsible for the register of domain names and the operation of the Domain Name System (DNS) in the .nz domain name space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far and away DNCL&amp;#39;s biggest issue right now is .nz registrations directly at the second level. In fact, it&amp;#39;s the most significant policy change in our history and we received more submissions on this issue than any previous consultation process. Co-ordinating this change, allowing for the technical aspects of it and alerting the public to the change will no doubt take up much of our focus for 2014. Another priority for us is encouraging Registrars towards DNSSEC-friendly status so that .nz domain name holders are both safer
and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>.MENU, .UNO, And .みんな Are Coming</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-10-Screen_Shot_2013-12-09_at_14.08.20.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-09 at 14.08.20.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an exciting time in the domain world, as hundreds of new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) are coming in the near future. Right now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;our catalog is up to 481&lt;/a&gt;, and that number may rise as more are announced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before each gTLD is &lt;a href=&quot;http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings&quot;&gt;official&lt;/a&gt;, they must &amp;quot;pass a rigorous evaluation process&amp;quot; through &lt;a href=&quot;http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;quot;ensure a safe, secure and measured rollout.&amp;quot; This rollout has been slow, but persistent--and now three additional TLDs have been delegated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-menu&quot;&gt;.MENU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-uno&quot;&gt;.UNO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA&quot;&gt;.みんな&lt;/a&gt; - Japanese for &amp;quot;everyone&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re thrilled to see these official announcements come through, but know that no launch dates have been set. Once we have more information, we&amp;#39;ll be sure to pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if .MENU, .UNO, and .みんな aren&amp;#39;t what you&amp;#39;re looking for, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;check out our full list of gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; and pre-order the one that&amp;#39;s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Interview With Ben Crawford, CEO of CentralNic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-10-Screen_Shot_2013-12-09_at_12.27.38.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-12-09 at 12.27.38.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centralnic.com&quot;&gt;CentralNic&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world&amp;#39;s largest domain registries, currently distributing popular domain names such as .uk.com, .us.com and .cn.com. But their portfolio is rapidly expanding with 60 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; coming soon, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wiki&quot;&gt;.wiki&lt;/a&gt;, .bar and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&quot;&gt;.xyz&lt;/a&gt;. To get some insight into this expansion, we reached out to Ben Crawford, CEO of CentralNic and asked a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; The elephant in the TLD room is obviously &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;. As fun and creative as other TLDs are, people keep going back for more of the old standby. What do you think the turning point will be to make alternative TLDs hit mass acceptance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternative TLDs have already hit mass acceptance, and there are three reasons why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, domains like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.de&lt;/a&gt;, and even SLD (&amp;quot;second level domain&amp;quot;) extensions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; have all sold over 10 million domains, because they have a specific meaning that is different from .com - if you want to let people know you are a not-for-profit, or a German business, or a British business, then those domains are much better than .com. And there is no doubt that some of the new gTLDs will also be a more suitable domain extension than .com for large numbers of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, with 110 million .com domains registered, good domains are not available with .com endings, or only available on the secondary market for hundreds, thousands, even millions of dollars. So alternatives to .com like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us.com-american-domain-name-registration-for-united-states-of-america&quot;&gt;.us.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&quot;&gt;.biz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.info&lt;/a&gt; already sell in large numbers too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is proven demand for domains at a lower cost than .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Of all the TLDs you have coming out in the near future, which ones do you have the highest hopes for? And why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s important to understand that the domains that sell in the highest numbers won&amp;#39;t necessarily be the the most profitable ones. That said, the ones we expect to sell the most of are our generics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&quot;&gt;.xyz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-website&quot;&gt;.website&lt;/a&gt;, which are suitable for any kind of site, and will also be price competitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the hurdles we&amp;#39;ve seen with domain extensions is general public awareness. Do you have any plans in place to get your new TLDs into the public lexicon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; Marketing is absolutely one of the keys to success for any new domain extension. We encourage and often assist our clients in reaching out directly to their potential registrants through trade press, exhibitions, direct marketing, and other channels, depending on their target markets. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-college&quot;&gt;.college&lt;/a&gt; is being promoted in the education sector, .bar and .rest for restaurants are being promoted to the food service industry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ink&quot;&gt;.ink&lt;/a&gt; in the tattoo world, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&quot;&gt;.press&lt;/a&gt; to the media, and so on. On top of that, we provide our registrars with marketing materials for all of our domains, to help them introduce and launch our TLDs to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; CentralNic is known for alternative extensions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gb.com-british-domain-name-registration-for-great-britain&quot;&gt;gb.com&lt;/a&gt;, us.com or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu.com-domain-name-registration-for-european-union&quot;&gt;eu.com&lt;/a&gt;. What percentage of your business do you expect to come from new TLDs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; CentralNic actually supports three different domain extension types, and we expect growth from all of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our distribution platform currently supports around 30 SLD extensions. Our latest launches include .mex.com for Mexico, .in.net for India, and .africa.com, and we plan to continue adding many more, as we only see the demand increasing for geography-specific and other alternative domains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also supporting an increasing number of ccTLDs on our platform, as we offer a unique solution for country codes, with proven successes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&quot;&gt;.la&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pw-palauan-domain-name-registration-for-palau&quot;&gt;.pw&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage we have fourteen uncontested gTLDs that we will be the exclusive distributor for, and we have more than thirty more still in contention. Our new TLDs include some of the best domain extensions ever launched, and our partners include some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the domain industry, so we do expect these domains to be our most successful to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Last but not least (and because we get the question all the time), when do you expect the first of your domain extensions going live? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ll start rolling them out in Q1 2014, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wiki&quot;&gt;.wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kiwi Code Retreat - Advancing The Art Of Coding Software</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest post by Aimee Whitcroft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coming Saturday December 14th, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; is really happy to be sponsoring the Wellington &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/142880662/&quot;&gt;Kiwi Code Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://globalday.coderetreat.org/&quot;&gt;Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/a&gt;, in which thousands of software developers in well over a hundred cities spend the day practicing their craft - code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy Palamountain, who is organiser and co-host with her partner Martin Holman, likens the retreat to the practice time put in by musicians. When musicians perform, the audience is amazed and thrilled by the musicians&amp;#39; mastery of their chosen instrument, but of course you don&amp;#39;t see the hours and years of practice put in behind the scenes. Hence the retreat. Says Amy: &amp;quot;Building software is a very creative endeavour, yet we go to work every day and essentially perform. We practice our craft often during the performance itself (if that makes sense!).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She goes on to say: &amp;quot;How much better would we be at our craft if we actually put time into practice - practice with no consequence? No client waiting for a solution, no expectations, just time to push your craft to the next level.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day will be split into six blocks, with coders changing partners for each block. Everyone is given a problem to work on, and a constraint that is added into the mix. At the end of each session, all traces of the code are deleted - the point being to stretch one&amp;#39;s coding muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy knows what she&amp;#39;s talking about when it comes to code - from Wellington originally, she&amp;#39;s been coding professionally for 6+ years, speaks regularly at schools and conferences, and is just about to start at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;! She says she &amp;quot;loves being part of a community of people who write code; people who make things&amp;quot;, and can&amp;#39;t wait for this weekend. Martin works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mindscapehq.com/&quot;&gt;MindScape&lt;/a&gt;, building an error reporting service called RayGun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked why they&amp;#39;re hosting this year&amp;#39;s event? &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re both firm believers in software craftsmanship, and that the values of writing great code transcend the language you program in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And it&amp;#39;s such a great way to meet and hang out with a bunch of Wellington&amp;#39;s top programmers!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t agree more, and we&amp;#39;re really proud to be sponsoring this year&amp;#39;s event, especially having recently marked &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/happy-5th-birthday-iwantmyname.html&quot;&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt; of being part of the Wellington tech community. We hope you enjoy it as much as we&amp;#39;ve enjoyed supporting it. [btw - if you are based north of the Bombay hills, have no fear! There&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/142664562/&quot;&gt;Auckland version&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Four-Letter .COMs Are A Four-Letter Word--Gone</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-05-bigstock-Sold-Out-Rubber-Stamp-43310818.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Sold-Out-Rubber-Stamp-43310818.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/04/four_letter_domain_names_zero_unclaimed_llll_dot_coms_left_on_the_internet.html&quot;&gt;From Will Oremus - Slate:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not just talking about four-letter names that spell actual words, like cars.com or pets.com (R.I.P). We&amp;#39;re not even just talking about pronounceable four-letter combinations, like eBay, Yelp, Etsy, and Hulu. We&amp;#39;re talking every possible four-letter combination, from aaaa.com to zzzz.com. That&amp;#39;s a total of 456,976 combinations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoapi.com/blog/1413/we-are-out-of-4-letter-com-domains/&quot;&gt;WhoAPI&lt;/a&gt; checked all 456,976 of them, and confirmed that not one remains unregistered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing the new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) are coming soon. With hundreds to choose from, there will be plenty of great four-letter options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you have one in mind, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;pre-orders for many of the new gTLDs are open now&lt;/a&gt;. Go take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>For Our Birthday, We&#39;re Giving Back (And You Should Too)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is turning five this week--a remarkable feat for any online business. And with a great staff, wonderful community support and unbelievably loyal customers, we&amp;#39;re excited about what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mark the occasion, we&amp;#39;re making a small but very significant change. From this week on, we&amp;#39;re going to donate 10 cents from each domain registered to global aid initiatives. It&amp;#39;s a small amount to begin with, but it&amp;#39;s a sustainable way we can celebrate our good fortune by giving back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Donation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound odd for a tech company to have a donation strategy; but we feel that we have a social responsibility to make a positive contribution in the world outside of our immediate sphere of interest. It&amp;#39;s also really important to make sure our aid money is put to good use. So we did quite a bit of research on &lt;a href=&quot;http://charitynavigator.org&quot;&gt;charitynavigator.org&lt;/a&gt; to find a charity that spends a high portion of its budget on programs and services, not executive boards and administration. We also wanted to support significant global causes, since our customers come from nearly every country on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Our First Charity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-05-save-the-children.png&quot; alt=&quot;Save The Children&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a nearly perfect &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;amp;orgid=4438&quot;&gt;Charity Navigator score&lt;/a&gt;, as well as impressively using 91.7% of its budget on programs and services, we&amp;#39;ve selected &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethechildren.org&quot;&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt; as our first charity of choice. More specifically, it&amp;#39;s our intention to support the fantastic work that Save The Children is doing right now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6150549/&quot;&gt;on the ground in typhoon ravaged Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But please don&amp;#39;t let our donation be the end of the story however. If you&amp;#39;re able, &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8855857/k.E53D/Donate_to_the_Typhoon_Haiyan_Childrens_Relief_Fund/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp&quot;&gt;please consider donating what you can&lt;/a&gt; to their global cause. It would make us happier than anything to inspire someone to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once again, thank you so much for supporting us for the last five years. We appreciate it more than you know.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Happy 5th Birthday iwantmyname!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideegeo/sets/72157638335879185/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-12-04-the-first-weeks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The first weeks at iwantmyname&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr set: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideegeo/sets/72157638335879185/&quot;&gt;The first few weeks at iwantmyname in 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in mid 2008 when two Germans and a Kiwi came together in New Zealand to start a company (a new domain name management service to be precise). I had known my now co-founder Lenz Gschwendtner from the domain industry in Germany and we shared the same business vision, so we eventually met at his home in Wellington to chat about the current state of DNS services and startups in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that first meeting, with the help of my fellow co-founder Paul Spence&amp;#39;s operations background, we began working on &lt;em&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/em&gt;. In just a few weeks we went from registering the company to launching a very basic product to customers (for example, we didn&amp;#39;t even accept &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we proved our assumption correct--the internet was craving a domain registrar built around great customer support and user experience. Because nobody has the time to mess around with confusing services and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/no-upselling-tactics-to-be-found-here.html&quot;&gt;endless upselling&lt;/a&gt;. People wanted a simple site to buy domains and get things up fast. We were called the anti-Go Daddy, and found our place as a niche domain registrar around the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to believe that this week will mark iwantmyname&amp;#39;s fifth year on the web--an achievement we couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have accomplished without our amazing customers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;such a great team&lt;/a&gt;. In our five years, we&amp;#39;ve grown to seven employees, serving 50,000 customers worldwide with more than 100,000 domain registrations, renewals and transfers processed. So thank you, thank you, thank you. We couldn&amp;#39;t possibly say it enough.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why Human Support Is So Important</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2013/12/will-google-kill-my-blog-on-december-6th.html&quot;&gt;From Bill McBride - Calculated Risk:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My credit card expired this year - as credit cards do - and Google notified me that I&amp;#39;d have to update my payment information to pay for the URL. No problem. I updated the information in my Blogger / Google account, but Google doesn&amp;#39;t seem to recognize this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried contacting Google, posting messages in Blogger and Google forums, and I&amp;#39;ve received no response. Help at Google tells me I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;free account&amp;quot; (even though I pay Google every year) and there is no help for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t indicative of all platforms that offer combination site builders and domain hosts (although we definitely recommend keeping them separate), but we can&amp;#39;t emphasize enough how important it is to be able to contact a real person. With Google, the answer is often &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; But if you&amp;#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/blogger-blogspot-free-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;hosting your domain with us while using Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, a real person will &lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;happily answer&lt;/a&gt; your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;support questions&lt;/a&gt; every time.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t Be Scared Of GitHub Pages</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained&quot;&gt;From Lauren Orsini - ReadWrite:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People use GitHub to host projects ranging from music composition to cookbooks to municipal data. But what you might not know is that GitHub isn&amp;#39;t just a storage locker, but also a showcase. That is, GitHub allows you to set up a bare-bones website you can use to display projects and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to GitHub Pages, the glossy, forward facing side of the site. Unlike the dense repositories that would confuse your less tech-savvy friends, Pages are ordinary looking websites that GitHub hosts for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of development, and certainly GitHub, is extremely intimidating for novice site creators. But it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be. As the articles subtitle reads, GitHub Pages is &amp;quot;like GitHub with training wheels, it&amp;#39;s an easier way to code open source.&amp;quot; Anyone can learn, and the link above is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, once you&amp;#39;re ready, don&amp;#39;t forget to pick up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;good domain name&lt;/a&gt;. We like to think it&amp;#39;s the most important part.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-29-bigstock-Homemade-Delicious-Pumpkin-Pie-52098646.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Homemade-Delicious-Pumpkin-Pie-52098646.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Thanksgiving today in the United States, and even though we&amp;#39;re a Kiwi company across the International Date Line (it&amp;#39;s already the 29th here), it&amp;#39;s as good a time as any to give thanks to all the people who&amp;#39;ve helped us have a great 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Our Amazing Customers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we&amp;#39;ve served thousands of customers here at iwantmyname, each with unique ideas, goals and interests. And through outposts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and even our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;email support channel&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ve had the opportunity to talk to a ton of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhDs. Bloggers. Photographers. Developers. Each and every one we&amp;#39;re thankful for. And we&amp;#39;re working hard this year to make our platform even better for the people who matter most (like you!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t possibly name all the people who&amp;#39;ve inspired us in 2013, so we won&amp;#39;t try to come up with any sort of large, incomplete list. And as Paul said in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/08/iwantmyname-in-the-community.html&quot;&gt;August blog post&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;the whole ecosystem here is fueled by good coffee and excellent local craft beer,&amp;quot; so our memory might be a bit fuzzy anyway. But for all those in the community who&amp;#39;ve helped make us who we are today, thank you, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re ever in the Wellington, New Zealand area for a conference or holiday (or if you happen to live here), be sure to stop by and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;say hi to the team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The iwantmyname Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from me, the newest staffer at iwantmyname, it&amp;#39;s truly amazing to see what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;lean group of seven&lt;/a&gt; (soon to be eight... &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/backend-developer&quot;&gt;apply today!&lt;/a&gt;) can accomplish. Every question answered, every site feature added, every bug stomped and every post we push live is completed by the most dynamic team I&amp;#39;ve ever been a part of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for that, I&amp;#39;m more thankful than anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Thanksgiving America.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Interview About .GURU With Mason Cole, VP Communications of Donuts Inc.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-28-Screen_Shot_2013-11-27_at_16.07.37.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-11-27 at 16.07.37.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much to our surprise, .GURU is the single most popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD)&lt;/a&gt; pre-ordered so far on iwantmyname. So we went to the underlying registry, Donuts Inc., to ask a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Mason, thanks for doing this with us. So first off, tell us a bit about .GURU. What&amp;#39;s its origin story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Donuts examined about 3,000 potential gTLDs for which to apply and narrowed that list to our eventual 307. According to the data we examined, there&amp;#39;s pretty good demand in the market for various specific domain names, including .GURU. It&amp;#39;s not that we had a particular affinity for the term (though we do like it) -- it&amp;#39;s more that we learned there are potential registrants who would like to use the name for all kinds of reasons. And we&amp;#39;re in the business of supplying new and varied Internet identity options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ve seen a surprising amount of interest in .GURU specifically--how much realistic growth potential do you see there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, your numbers are telling you the story.  Suffice to say we would not have put $185,000 into an application if we didn&amp;#39;t think it had a reasonable amount of potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people are excited about the new gTLDs, but we&amp;#39;ve seen quite a bit of cynicism online. Do you think the world is ready? Will these gTLDs succeed in &amp;quot;categorizing the web?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the world is ready. The cynicism, we believe, is unwarranted and probably comes with the discomfort in general associated with disruption. When you have a worn out and tired .COM namespace with no reasonable naming options left, new and specific, relevant identity opportunities will be very welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; From a marketing perspective, what would be the biggest win for .GURU? A successful blog using the TLD? A startup website?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Our measure of use success is that applied by the registrant. If a registrant puts .GURU to use in a way that&amp;#39;s productive for his/her needs, it&amp;#39;s a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; The internet is quite an interesting place, but I think it&amp;#39;ll get much more interesting once .COM isn&amp;#39;t the norm for the &amp;quot;everyday web surfer.&amp;quot; What obstacles do you think need to be overcome to get us there? And what can the early tech adopters do to help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s going to be a little while at least until the typical registrant learns the ins and outs of new gTLDs. That&amp;#39;s to be expected. That said, new gTLDs will be far more intuitive and relevant to those who are looking for specificity in describing products, services, activities, information, etc. Some early adopters will make their registrations extremely prominent in their advertising and consumer-facing communications. That kind of validation will help ease new TLDs into broad use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Donuts Inc. on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DonutsInc&quot;&gt;@DonutsInc&lt;/a&gt;. And remember, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;pre-ordering is open for .GURU domains&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>TIME&#39;s Person of the Year Going Social With RebelMouse</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-27-Screen_Shot_2013-11-26_at_17.24.16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-11-26 at 17.24.16.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://poy.time.com/2013/11/25/time-partners-with-twitter-to-launch-times-person-of-the-year/?xid=gonewsedit&quot;&gt;From Time:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIME will also be incorporating Vines, Twitter&amp;#39;s 6-second video product, into its Person of the Year walk-up, with celebrities, politicians and other influential people weighing in on who they would choose. Readers can submit their own Vine videos using #TIMEPOY as well, and they will be collected on a RebelMouse page and featured on Time.com. Twitter will also tweet about #TIMEPOY from Twitter&amp;#39;s main accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the TIME Person of the Year will be made by TIME managing editor Nancy Gibbs on NBC&amp;#39;s Today Show on Wednesday, December 11, coinciding with the news breaking on Twitter from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/time&quot;&gt;@TIME&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a social platform itself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/rebelmouse-custom-domain&quot;&gt;RebelMouse&lt;/a&gt; gives you the ability to aggregate all of your social accounts into one custom site. All your Facebook posts, Tweets, Tumblogs, Pinterest pins and a number of posts from other platforms. It also lets you expand on social posts--such as turning &amp;quot;an Instagram photo into a full blog post (with) relevant tweets and other links.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using RebelMouse, TIME&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://poy.time.com/2012/12/19/social-reactions-to-times-person-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;2012 TIME Person of the Year page&lt;/a&gt; was definitely cool stuff--and the 2013 page looks to be even better. Be on the lookout for new #TIMEPOY posts soon on &lt;a href=&quot;http://poy.time.com&quot;&gt;poy.time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Credit:&lt;/strong&gt; RebelMouse was also one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techland.time.com/2013/05/06/50-best-websites-2013/slide/rebelmouse/&quot;&gt;TIME&amp;#39;s 50 Best Websites of 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it&amp;#39;s time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/rebelmouse-custom-domain&quot;&gt;start a RebelMouse site&lt;/a&gt; of your own?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Holiday Shipping Made Easy With Squarespace x ShipStation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-shipstation&quot;&gt;From Thomas Chau - Squarespace:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The welcome spike in sales that comes with the holiday season is all too often accompanied by the challenge of fulfilling all these additional orders. The manual process of printing shipping labels is one of the biggest drains on a merchant&amp;#39;s already limited time. To relieve some of the burden, we are excited to announce a partnership with ShipStation, fully integrating their leading web-based shipping software to create a seamless experience that will save merchants tons of time in shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to set up an online shop for the holidays, definitely take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shipstation.com/squarespace_pricing/?utm_source=SQSP&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=announce_blog&amp;amp;ref=SQSP&quot;&gt;Squarespace with ShipStation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; is a great platform for creating professional sites with no development or design knowledge, and now the shipping logistics are easier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>10 Big Brands Using Domain Hacks For URL Shortening On Twitter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-23-Screen_Shot_2013-11-22_at_14.46.31.png&quot; alt=&quot;StarWars Tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you want to say on Twitter, you only get 140 characters to say it. On one hand, it&amp;#39;s part of the reason Twitter has been so successful--it mercilessly removes fluff from online writing. But when it comes to sharing links, 140 characters can really cramp your style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this, you can shorten them using a number of generic link-shortening platforms. But if you&amp;#39;re ambitious, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-tools-we-use-bitly-for-link-shortening.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;brand&lt;/em&gt; your links with Bitly&lt;/a&gt; using a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hack&lt;/a&gt;, like our personal favorite, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwnt.my&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;iwnt.my&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inspiration, here are ten influential brands using custom link shortening for their Twitter links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Wars - &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://strw.rs&quot;&gt;strw.rs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube - &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be&quot;&gt;youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bon Appetit - &lt;a href=&quot;http://bonapp.it&quot;&gt;bonapp.it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney - &lt;a href=&quot;http://di.sn&quot;&gt;nyti.ms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chobani - &lt;a href=&quot;http://cho.ba&quot;&gt;cho.ba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolling Stone - &lt;a href=&quot;http://rol.st&quot;&gt;rol.st&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Verge - &lt;a href=&quot;http://vrge.co&quot;&gt;vrge.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virgin - &lt;a href=&quot;http://virg.in&quot;&gt;virg.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBC - &lt;a href=&quot;http://bbc.in&quot;&gt;bbc.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pepsi - &lt;a href=&quot;http://pep.si&quot;&gt;pep.si&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Get Ready For .KITCHEN, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .DIRECTORY And More</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-23-bigstock-Kitchen-restaurant-31552076.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Kitchen-restaurant-31552076.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-guru-clothing-gallery-graphics-and-more.html&quot;&gt;we launched pre-orders for .GURU, .CLOTHING, .GALLERY and a handful of others&lt;/a&gt;, and now we&amp;#39;re here to announce a few more. The next batch of generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) available for pre-order* are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-diamonds&quot;&gt;.DIAMONDS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&quot;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&quot;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&quot;&gt;.DIRECTORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-enterprises&quot;&gt;.ENTERPRISES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kitchen&quot;&gt;.KITCHEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&quot;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some good ones here, don&amp;#39;t you think? LastName.ENTERPRISES, Coding.TIPS, MakeSomething.TODAY--the possibilities are endless. And like always, pre-orders are totally free, so get your name on the list today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, be sure to see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;redesigned gTLD page&lt;/a&gt;, which now segments TLDs open for pre-order from the rest of the list. It&amp;#39;s quite handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that these pre-orders are expressions of interest and do not guarantee you your desired domain name. Here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If multiple customers pre-order the same domain name, it will go through an internal lottery once the pre-registration period is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your pre-order is selected, it will then be submitted against other registrars pre-registrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something happens to the underlying registry, or if an unforeseen circumstance occurs, there&amp;#39;s a chance we may not carry the gTLD at all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For more generic/popular requests, final selection will take a bit of luck, but we will do our best to get you the domain you&amp;#39;re looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>WordPress.com, Now With Markdown</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-22-wordpress-logo-hoz-rgb.png&quot; alt=&quot;wordpress-logo-hoz-rgb.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#39;t talked about Wordpress much in the past, but we&amp;#39;re big fans of using Markdown for writing on the web. And now, we&amp;#39;re happy to learn that WordPress.com is adopting Markdown as a formatting option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/markdown/&quot;&gt;From Matt Wiebe at WordPress:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown has arrived on WordPress.com! Some of you may respond with &amp;quot;Finally!&amp;quot; Others might be asking, &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s that?&amp;quot; Markdown is a quick way to add formatted text without writing out any HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case you&amp;#39;re interested in some details, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown nerds (like me!) know there are a lot of variants out there. On WordPress.com, we&amp;#39;re using a slightly modified version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/&quot;&gt;Markdown Extra&lt;/a&gt;, with a tweak to allow fenced code blocks inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown&quot;&gt;GitHub Flavored Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. It&amp;#39;s easy to use your domains with a hosted blog at WordPress.com. Simply get their custom domain add-on and update the nameservers in your iwantmyname dashboard by selecting it from the popular hosts dropdown menu.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How To Transfer Your Domain Away From iwantmyname (And A Bit On Why You Shouldn&#39;t)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;domain management ethics&lt;/a&gt; from the very beginning—we&amp;#39;ll never prevent you from transferring your domain away from iwantmyname. Because we believe nothing in life is worse than being stuck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re looking to transfer your domain from iwantmyname to another registrar, here&amp;#39;s how to do it for domains that require an authorization code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login to your account and click &lt;em&gt;Domains&lt;/em&gt; in the top nav. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the domain you&amp;#39;d like to transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the &lt;em&gt;Transfer Lock&lt;/em&gt; setting to &lt;em&gt;unlocked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;em&gt;Transfer Auth Code&lt;/em&gt; provided to move your domain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve retrieved your Transfer Auth Code (sometimes registrars also call it an EPP key), you can begin the transfer process in your registrar of choice. Please note though that some registries prohibit transfers within 60 days of registration, so you may have to wait some time if it&amp;#39;s a new domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as your new registrar has informed us about the transfer request, you will be able to approve it from within the iwantmyname dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-21-outgoing-transfer.png&quot; alt=&quot;outgoing-transfer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain extensions that don&amp;#39;t require an authorization code usually bypass the registrar and the transfer process is handled by the underlying registry. For example if you want to transfer an Austrian domain, you start the process with your new registrar and the .AT registry Nic.at sends you an email to confirm the transaction. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before you decide to go ahead with your domain transfer, here are a few things you should know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many hosts offer domain names, but know that your domain and site/email host doesn&amp;#39;t have to (and probably shouldn&amp;#39;t) be one and the same. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same note, we don&amp;#39;t offer any hosting services of our own. We do one thing and do it well--domain management. But we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; offer one-click installations to some of the most popular platforms on the web through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/featured&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s not required to get the transfer authorization code to renew a domain. If you have received an email asking for an auth code, it might be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/beware-of-domain-renewal-scams.html&quot;&gt;renewal scam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve run into any issues, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re always here to help&lt;/a&gt;. And when you send us a question, a real person (not an automated service) will respond. Every time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>.UK Domains Without The .CO, Coming Summer 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-21-bigstock-Big-Ben-with-autumn-leaves-Lo-49194818.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Big-Ben-with-autumn-leaves-Lo-49194818.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always interesting to look through the different country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs). You see tons of countries with great two-letter domains, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.ES&lt;/a&gt; for Spain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt; for Germany, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&quot;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt; for Canada. But then when you get to the UK, you&amp;#39;re stuck with .CO.UK, .ORG.UK and a few other two-part extensions. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nominet.org.uk/news/press-releases/nominet-introduce-shorter-uk-domain-name-registrations&quot;&gt;From Nominet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From summer 2014, shorter, simpler &amp;#39;example.uk&amp;#39; domain names will be available for the first time alongside &amp;#39;example.co.uk&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;example.org.uk&amp;#39; and so on. This represents the biggest modification of the .uk namespace since it began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any unique &amp;#39;example.uk&amp;#39; domain name (e.g. one that does not have an equivalent name already registered as a .co.uk or a .org.uk) will be available on a first-come, first served basis from launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An official announcement with the definitive launch date will come by February 2014, so check back here for all your your up-to-date news on the .UK launch.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pre-Orders Now Open For .GURU, .CLOTHING, .GALLERY .GRAPHICS And More</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-20-bigstock-Museum-Visitors-47867966.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-Museum-Visitors-47867966.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come one. Come all. Pre-orders* for the following generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) start today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery&quot;&gt;.GALLERY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics&quot;&gt;.GRAPHICS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing&quot;&gt;.PLUMBING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-contractors&quot;&gt;.CONTRACTORS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sexy&quot;&gt;.SEXY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-construction&quot;&gt;.CONSTRUCTION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo&quot;&gt;.TATTOO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&quot;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-estate&quot;&gt;.ESTATE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land&quot;&gt;.LAND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.BIKE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why would you be looking to get one of these fine gTLDs, you ask? Look at it this way. Let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re looking to start a gallery called &lt;em&gt;Hall&lt;/em&gt;. Chances are, every derivation of the words &lt;em&gt;Hall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gallery&lt;/em&gt; are going to be taken in the .com world. So while you could get a country code TLD (ccTLD) domain like hallgallery.is, the new gTLDs give you a great opportunity to help &lt;em&gt;categorize&lt;/em&gt; the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a nice gTLD like .GALLERY, you could use Hall.gallery, because Hall is...a gallery. And if this particular Hall wasn&amp;#39;t a place, but a guru, you could use Hall.guru. The possibilities are endless, so get excited. Try a new gTLD out. We really think they&amp;#39;re going to change the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-order your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery&quot;&gt;.GALLERY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics&quot;&gt;.GRAPHICS&lt;/a&gt;, and all the other gTLDs listed above today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pre-orders are simply expressions of interest and do not mean you are guaranteed to get your desired domain name. And here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-order availability does not guarantee availability on iwantmyname.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All domains ordered by multiple customers will go through an internal lottery once the pre-registration period is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your order is selected by iwantmyname, it will then be submitted against all other domain registrars who may be after the same domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some of the more popular requests, it will take a bit of luck, but rest assured, we will do our very best to secure your requested domain for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>A Note From ICANN About gTLD Pre-Orders</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we started pre-orders on our very first generic Top Level Domain (gTLD), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;. And while it&amp;#39;s a very exciting occasion for us, as well as the internet community as a whole, we can&amp;#39;t emphasize enough that gTLD pre-orders are not a guaranteed reservation. We&amp;#39;ve put a visible disclaimer on all gTLD pre-order pages, but here&amp;#39;s a recent blog post from ICANN that reinforces the rationale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2013/11/pre-reserve-a-domain-name-or-not-icann-answers-the-question/&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As responsible Registrars are advising, successful pre-registration of a domain cannot be guaranteed. ICANN seconds that advice, cautioning that registrants should be wary of anyone who claims to be able to guarantee a domain registration on a new gTLD. There are several situations that can impact the availability of a domain name and some domain names may never be available for purchase. Instances that can impact availability of Second-Level Domains include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Registrars per generic Top-Level Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many gTLD Registries contract with multiple Registrars to provide registration services to Internet users. The Registrar you pre-register with may not be the Registrar that eventually registers the name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trademarked Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rights holders that have submitted verified trademarks will be given priority access to request domain names related to their trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auction of Premium Names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Registries may choose to offer perceived premium names for registration to the highest bidder before they&amp;#39;re made available to the general public, so some of these names may not be available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name Collision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain Second-Level Domain names must be blocked by Registries because their activation could potentially impact the operations of some private domains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some gTLDs may not be delegated&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no assurance that ICANN will sign Registry Agreements for all of the new gTLDs for which applications have been submitted, nor is there any assurance that all of the new gTLDs will be delegated. If you pre-register a desired domain name and the underlying gTLD is not delegated, that domain name will not be available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For updated posts on recently delegated gTLDs, keep following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname blog&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;here&amp;#39;s a list containing many of the delegated and non-delegated TLDs set to launch in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Trello For Content And Idea Management</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that becomes strained when you work for a company that promotes offsite working is organization. Updates, newsletters, product rollouts--the pieces of the puzzle that make your brand tick--can easily fall behind if you don&amp;#39;t keep things in an orderly fashion. But now, the online tools available for internal communication and idea management have made needing a centralized office less important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the best examples of these tools is &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what&amp;#39;s being worked on, who&amp;#39;s working on what, and where something is in a process.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/29183832?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For iwantmyname, we find Trello to be especially useful for organizing our blog, and it&amp;#39;s all done with only four lists: &lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Researching&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Editing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Publish&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, when a team member comes up with an idea we should write about, they open a card in the &lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt; list. In that card, they can assign the idea to a certain person, leave comments to get conversations going, add checklists for idea organization, and even attach relevant files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if an idea is chosen, the card is dragged and dropped into the &lt;em&gt;Researching&lt;/em&gt; list, where it stays throughout the writing process. And again, if any information is needed, additional comments can be left on the card which notifies all the people attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we drop in a Dropbox link of the first draft and place it in &lt;em&gt;Editing&lt;/em&gt;, where a good 25% of the magic happens. Usually. Then the card goes to &lt;em&gt;Publish&lt;/em&gt;, where we toss the content into our CMS for the world to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like magic, and with only a fraction of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/tour&quot;&gt;overall feature-set&lt;/a&gt; used, Trello has completely revolutionized our blog management structure. We definitely recommend giving it a shot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I was reminded today that we adopted our Trello blog strategy &lt;a href=&quot;http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/07/30/trello-blog/&quot;&gt;from this post on Pingdom&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a much more in-depth look at what the process entails, so definitely check it out if you&amp;#39;re interested in the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Philippines Typhoon: How You Can Help</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-14-haiyan2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;haiyan2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines may have quite possibly suffered its worst natural disaster in recent history as Super Typhoon Haiyan passed directly across the tropical Western Pacific archipelago. If you are struggling to comprehend the enormous power unleashed by a storm of this magnitude, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24906576&quot;&gt;this BBC video report&lt;/a&gt;
 filmed during the onslaught, when winds were reportedly gusting over 185 m.p.h (300 km/hr)! The full extent of the disaster is not yet clear, with reports of a death toll anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 and literally millions displaced. So, how can we help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Pacific rim nations such as Japan, Taiwan, United States, New Zealand and Chile are well acquainted with natural disasters such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html&quot;&gt;tropical storms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-photos/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503036&quot;&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;#39;m sure we can all 
empathize with this tragedy. But we may also be feeling a little powerless to help. A while ago we were delighted to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html&quot;&gt;Philippines domain&lt;/a&gt; to our registrar offerings; so it only seems right to contribute something back at this difficult time. Children suffer most of all during a disaster, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; has made an immediate cash donation to UNICEF today. This is a relief agency established within the United Nations to support children at risk globally. The American Red Cross also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org/donate/index.jsp?donateStep=2&amp;amp;itemId=prod4650031&quot;&gt;special fund&lt;/a&gt; aimed specifically at getting resources into the affected region. If you wish to donate anonymously, you can do so by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=2663&quot;&gt;Givealittle&lt;/a&gt; platform and selecting your preferred recipient relief agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this tragedy continues to unfold, it is difficult not to feel great concern for the Philippines nation which has already suffered so much this year with numerous storms and earthquakes. As a business based in the Asia-Pacific region we feel a social responsibility to contribute; it&amp;#39;s a sentiment that we have backed up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html&quot;&gt;participating directly&lt;/a&gt; in aid programmes in the past. I hope you will join us and give what you can to the people of the Philippines. Even a small financial donation can go a long way in times of need. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It&#39;s Time To Drop The .CO--.NZ Pre-Ordering Starts Today</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;#39;re a business in New Zealand currently using a .CO.NZ address. It&amp;#39;s probably been fine up to now, but does your domain name really need to resemble an advanced medical degree? Perhaps it&amp;#39;s time to drop the extraneous letters. Get rid of the .CO. Liberate your domain name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your reason for wanting a .NZ domain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;pre-orders have begun&lt;/a&gt;, and now is the very best time to get the one you want. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-kiwimore-gtlds-coming-soon.html&quot;&gt;As with .KIWI&lt;/a&gt;, the process is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the domain you want, then click the &amp;quot;I want this domain &amp;gt;&amp;quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, either enter your email address or sign in to complete the pre-order process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the TLD goes public, we will notify you of your domain pre-order status/next steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; This pre-order is simply an expression of interest and does not guarantee that you will secure your desired domain name. Exact details are still to come, but we expect that owners .CO.NZ, .NET.NZ and .ORG.NZ will have grandfathered first access to claim their existing domains as .NZ. We will keep you updated about any further details, such as the different launch phases and pricing, as soon as these details are announced. The iwantmyname team is attending the .NZ Registrar Conference in Wellington today and we are hoping to have more information very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&quot;&gt;Pre-order your .NZ domain today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.WS Renewal Price Increasing On December 1, 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-14-main-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;main-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of unfortunate news this morning from your friendly neighborhood domain registrar—if you&amp;#39;ve registered, or are looking to register, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa&quot;&gt;.WS domain name&lt;/a&gt;, be aware that the domain registry manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://website.ws&quot;&gt;WebSite.ws&lt;/a&gt; has announced that &lt;strong&gt;renewal prices will be increasing&lt;/strong&gt; on December 1, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this price increase does not change the purchase cost, just the renewal rate after your first year, which is changing from $US 19.00/yr to $US 34.90/yr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, the bad news is over now. All that&amp;#39;s left is this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanger.dk&quot;&gt;loop of a pug licking your computer screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Philippines Disaster: Help If You Can</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-13-asiapac.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;asiapac.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will no doubt be aware, the Philippines has suffered what is possibly its worst natural disaster in recent history with the passage of Super Typhoon Haiyan. If you have any doubt about the enormous power unleashed by this storm, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24906576&quot;&gt;this BBC video report&lt;/a&gt; filmed during the onslaught, when winds were reportedly gusting over 300 km/hr! The full extent of the disaster is not yet clear, with reports of a death toll anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 and literally millions displaced. So, how can we help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Pacific rim nation, not unfamiliar with natural disasters ourselves, I&amp;#39;m sure we can all empathise with this tragedy. But we may also feel a little powerless to help. We were delighted to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html&quot;&gt;Philippines domain&lt;/a&gt; to our offerings a while back, so it only seems right to contribute something back. Children suffer greatly in times of disaster, so we&amp;#39;ve made an immediate cash donation to UNICEF. This is a relief agency established under the auspices of the United Nations to support children at risk globally. The New Zealand Red Cross have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcross.org.nz/donate/typhoon-haiyan-appeal&quot;&gt;dedicated fund&lt;/a&gt; aimed at getting resources into the affected region and you can also donate securely and anonymously to a number of aid agencies using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=2663&quot;&gt;Givealittle&lt;/a&gt; platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell how this tragedy will unfold, but it&amp;#39;s hard not to feel great concern for a nation which has already suffered substantially this year with numerous storms and earthquakes. As a business based in the Asia-Pacific region we feel a social responsibility to contribute; something that we have backed up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html&quot;&gt;participating directly&lt;/a&gt; in aid programmes in the past. I hope you will join us and give what you can. Even a small amount can go a long way in times of need. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pre-Orders Now Open For .KIWI—More gTLDs Coming Soon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-12-dot-kiwi-domain-preorder.png&quot; alt=&quot;dot-kiwi-domain-preorder.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a New Zealand-based domain registrar, it&amp;#39;s only proper for us to officially start our generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) pre-orders with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;--the coolest little TLD on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot-kiwi.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Dot Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time New Zealanders have a unique way to take pride in their Kiwi-ness online. It&amp;#39;s called .kiwi (&amp;#39;dot kiwi&amp;#39;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe the .kiwi domain will be hugely valuable for Kiwi businesses, opening the door to greater branding creativity and creating more opportunities for companies to differentiate themselves from competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;d like to lay claim to your own piece of beautiful New Zealand, here&amp;#39;s how you can do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, head over to to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLD page&lt;/a&gt; and select your desired extension. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt; is the only one currently offering pre-orders, but more will come very soon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the domain you want, then click the &amp;quot;I want this domain &amp;gt;&amp;quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, either enter your email address or sign in to complete the pre-order process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the TLD goes public, we will notify you of your domain pre-order status/next steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this pre-order is an expression of interest and &lt;strong&gt;does not guarantee&lt;/strong&gt; you your desired domain name. Once the pre-order process ends, your domain will go into a lottery with other internal name applicants, then will be submitted against other registrars for final selection. For some of the more popular names (domains like &lt;em&gt;chris.kiwi&lt;/em&gt;), your selection will come down to a bit of luck, but we&amp;#39;ll do our very best to get you the domain you want. We will keep you updated about any further details, such as the different launch phases and pricing, as soon as these come to hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and have fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;pre-ordering your .KIWI domains&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Your Google+ Profile Is Not A Place You Own</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6698821&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.vrypan.net/2013/11/08/why-i-wont-use-a-gplus-custom-url/&quot;&gt;Why I won&amp;#39;t use a G+ custom URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A URL is an identifier. I&amp;#39;ll use it to identify myself on this service. I&amp;#39;ll link to it from my website. I may print it on a business card. Like Google said in their email, I&amp;#39;ll use it to &amp;quot;point folks to my profile&amp;quot;. But they can take it away for any reason or decide to charge me a (yet unknown) amount of money in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No way. I&amp;#39;ll stay with my current, unfriendly one, https://plus.google.com/107350252619396782277/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll do it to prevent myself from using it as an identifier. If you want to find me on Google+, &amp;quot;go to www.vrypan.net and follow the Google+ link&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll also do it as a reminder, that Google+ is not a place I own, it&amp;#39;s a place Google is kind enough to let me visit and have some limited activity, but they can always kick me off or ask for an (unspecified) rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve said it before and will repeat it again: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html&quot;&gt;your username tied to another domain simply does not belong to you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Zachary Crockett, Founder And CTO Of Spark</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/67698662?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Crockett, thanks for doing this with us! So I&amp;#39;ll jump right to it--Spark is really really cool, and we think more people should know about it. Give us the rundown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; We make tools to help people build internet-connected hardware products. Our first product, the Spark Core (video above), is a small development kit for a hardware product with a Wi-Fi connection. Think appliances, toys, home security and monitoring. It&amp;#39;s a fork of Arduino, so folks who have done hardware prototyping with an Arduino would be comfortable with the Spark Core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Your domain is also quite cool--&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spark.io&quot;&gt;spark.io&lt;/a&gt;. Tell us a little about how you guys came to choosing a .io domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; .io domains are being used more and more frequently in the world of developer tools, and since that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re building, .io seemed very appropriate for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What would you tell another site owner looking into a non-.com domain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the stigma around non-.com domains is gone because there are so many great start-ups using other TLDs. However there are still &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not cool&amp;quot; TLDs, and they vary by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And what about Kickstarter? We&amp;#39;ve seen some amazing projects come through with Kickstarter funding--how was that process? Exciting? Horrifying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; Exciting :-) Kickstarter is a wonderful vehicle to launch a product, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible&quot;&gt;Kickstarter community&lt;/a&gt; is so supportive. We&amp;#39;ve gotten incredible feedback from our backers that have made our product so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; It looks like the target shipment date for Spark Core is November 18th? Where can we get one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-order now at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spark.io&quot;&gt;spark.io&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Zachary on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/towynlin&quot;&gt;@towynlin&lt;/a&gt;. Also, follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sparkdevices&quot;&gt;@sparkdevices&lt;/a&gt; for all the latest news and happenings at Spark.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.BIKE, .CLOTHING, .GURU, .HOLDINGS, .PLUMBING, .SINGLES, .VENTURES Top-Level Domains Launching Jan 29, 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-09-Screen_Shot_2013-11-08_at_11.09.43.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-11-08 at 11.09.43.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;Generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; are going to rule the internet one day. .BLOG, .DOCTOR, .CLUB, .NYC. The fact that the internet of today is completely dominated by .COM is really just an availability fluke. It&amp;#39;s what people are used to. But it doesn&amp;#39;t take a ton of imagination to see how targeting your domain name to a specific category would make for a more useful web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donuts.co&quot;&gt;Donuts Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely well-funded registry that &amp;quot;has applied for more than 300 TLDs and intends to secure and operate each,&amp;quot; has announced the eminent general availability of seven new gTLDs. And it&amp;#39;s a big deal for a number of reasons. One, these are amongst the first gTLDs announced for general availability. And whether you&amp;#39;re interested in the names or not, they&amp;#39;re part of the first true tide-change of internet naming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here are the new gTLDs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&quot;&gt;.BIKE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&quot;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&quot;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holdings&quot;&gt;.HOLDINGS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing&quot;&gt;.PLUMBING&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-singles&quot;&gt;.SINGLES&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ventures&quot;&gt;.VENTURES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders for these new top-level domians will be available on iwantmyname before you know it, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;check back soon&lt;/a&gt; for further announcements!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>No Upselling Tactics To Be Found Here</title>
				<description>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine upselling lessons we can learn from domain registrars &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/ghr9w593JM&quot;&gt;http://t.co/ghr9w593JM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Econsultancy (@Econsultancy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Econsultancy/statuses/395926822254571520&quot;&gt;October 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came across this post last week from Econsultancy titled, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://econsultancy.com/nz/blog/63696-nine-upselling-lessons-we-can-learn-from-domain-registrars&quot;&gt;Nine upselling lessons we can learn from domain registrars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. And being a company that strictly refrains from gimmicky upselling tactics, we have a few things to say about it. And our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upsells should be priced low enough to be an impulse buy. When offering an upsell, make it a price point that appears to the user as significantly cheaper than the original product they were buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-07-namecheap-shopping-cart.png&quot; alt=&quot;namecheap-shopping-cart.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at the mess in this basket. $2 here. $3.33/mo there. At iwantmyname, we don&amp;#39;t try to nitpick you with upsells in your cart. A domain is a domain, and our prices are set to provide the best balance of value and support we can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present the upsell as benefits to the user. By highlighting the benefits of a product, rather than its features, customers will understand what it offers them and will be more likely to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-07-crazydomains_certification.png&quot; alt=&quot;crazydomains_certification.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a trick many online businesses use to upsell--providing services that users don&amp;#39;t quite understand as a scare tactic. The example here shows a Domain Certification that can be purchased at extra cost, complete with a paragraph of the benefits it can provide for your business. And for many users, that sort of add-on might sound reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is that when you purchase a domain, it&amp;#39;s registered to you through the underlying registry for a year--no phony certification needed. Tricking your customers into purchasing add-ons just isn&amp;#39;t the way to do business on the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage the user to choose between options. When customers are purchasing, there is a general inertia. They will usually take the path of least resistance. By offering a choice (such as different levels of hosting), the user must make a conscious decision between the options rather than being able to just ignore the upsell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to go with a minimum-tier purchase, so at iwantmyname, we don&amp;#39;t give options. If you want a service like &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425-do-you-offer-a-whois-privacy-service-&quot;&gt;whois masking&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s entirely free. Nor do we try to provide second-rate services to inflate our offerings. If you need email hosting or a platform to build a site, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with powerful options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use price psychology. It is a similar situation to choosing a wine in a restaurant, where people are reluctant to choose the cheapest bottle, but don&amp;#39;t want to pick the &amp;#39;premium&amp;#39; option. It gives them an easy compromise choice that is neither the most basic, nor too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that many registrars play into people&amp;#39;s psyches to boost a purchase, but we don&amp;#39;t look for upsells. Ever. And we make an active effort to keep all the content on our site clear and concise. At iwantmyname, the value of our service comes from honest simplicity, not how many cheap add-ons we can throw in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer the user an unbeatable deal. When trying to upsell, offering a compelling offer may encourage users to engage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using bundled sales as a marketing strategy could take up a post on its own, but put simply, the only &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&quot;&gt;discounts we offer&lt;/a&gt; are for single domains, and they usually only come when we are offered a short-term price fluctuation from the underlying registry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the differences between options clear. Make higher cost packages appear more comprehensive by showing icons or checklists (and don&amp;#39;t forget to explain what these additional features are, if it&amp;#39;s not clear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-07-register-options.png&quot; alt=&quot;register-options.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re probably starting to sound like a broken record here, but if you find yourself questioning the complexity of your purchase because of a confusing sales pitch, it may be time to find a new registrar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t increase time or number of items without asking the user. A better approach to this would be to give the user the option to increase their term, while offering strong benefits (better pricing, added value services or the benefit of not forgetting to renew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy a domain through us, what you&amp;#39;re purchasing is really easy to understand. You get the selected domain for one year for the price displayed. No sneaky deals. No confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a long term approach to upselling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or decide not to upsell at all. Our mission at iwantmyname is to help you get the web address you want as quickly as possible and not squeeze the last cent out of everything. We think our customers prefer it our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently came across this one too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/Rb308GgfC5&quot;&gt;http://t.co/Rb308GgfC5&lt;/a&gt; upsells and cross-sells its customers &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/CGCWyrfG0V&quot;&gt;http://t.co/CGCWyrfG0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DomainNameWire.com (@DomainNameWire) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DomainNameWire/statuses/398123985226842112&quot;&gt;November 6, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was a customer calling us, who bought — who saw our TV ads, they would be buying our new custom website product, which has almost 10 different products bundled together and it gives them everything they need to get found on the first page of a local Google search. And so then they&amp;#39;re going to get follow-up phone calls talking about things like Facebook and some of our other enhanced products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than all else, we promise to never upsell you over the phone. If you like our service, we&amp;#39;d be honored to have you as a repeat customer, but we&amp;#39;ll never be pushy with high-pressure or annoying phone calls. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Perfecting Workplace Culture</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we place a high priority on having fun, constantly working on things everyone is passionate about and not treating each other like resources on a Gantt chart. It&amp;#39;s what drives us to do good work. To make cool things we believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are so many intangibles that go into creating a great office culture, and new ideas and philosophies are being written about every day. Here are a few of the things we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this week:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Three Steps To Get The Most From Your Custom Short URL Using Bitly And Buffer</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your Twitter feed and you&amp;#39;ll likely see how pervasive custom short URLs are becoming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilbo Baggins learns exactly why the dwarves need a burglar in a gripping new &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Hobbit&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#Hobbit&lt;/a&gt; trailer: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/k4IK3zDg7A&quot;&gt;http://t.co/k4IK3zDg7A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RollingStone/statuses/397742880129044480&quot;&gt;November 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Mavericks Mail With Gmail Accounts: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/ZGmzpgDW2g&quot;&gt;http://t.co/ZGmzpgDW2g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Daring Fireball (@daringfireball) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daringfireball/statuses/397107075144105984&quot;&gt;November 3, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.J. Abrams on Star Wars: Episode VII: the saga may return to its gritty, &amp;quot;space western&amp;quot; roots &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/j26xKC6n6h&quot;&gt;http://t.co/j26xKC6n6h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; The Verge (@verge) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/verge/statuses/397753405130559488&quot;&gt;November 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a trend we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more of, and it&amp;#39;s a fantastic way to brand your social content. And best of all, it&amp;#39;s a simple task to accomplish using Bitly and Buffer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get A Short Domain Name.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to branding your social posts is to get a shortened domain name. For instance, if you look above you&amp;#39;ll see daringfireball.com (18 characters) shortened to df4.us (6 characters). The goal here is to make the most of your 140 characters on Twitter by limiting the length of your links. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So set your sights for &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwmn.me/VSOb/5mCr9l3O&quot;&gt;iwmn.me/VSOb/5mCr9l3O&lt;/a&gt; to get a custom short domain that&amp;#39;ll be automatically setup for Bitly. The key is to make it short, uncomplicated and related to your brand name—whether it be your company or personal brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you already have an iwantmyname domain name, just login and head over to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, choose Bitly, then hit Install. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Get Your Bitly Account.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your custom domain, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com&quot;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; and get an account. Then, in settings, you can set up your custom short domain for personal or business use. The setup is super simple, and because you already have the custom domain setup through iwantmyname, your work here is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Get Buffer.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a social media manager or someone in charge of posting for a number of social platforms at once, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bufferapp.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; is an invaluable tool. In one place, you can manage Twitter, Facebook, Google+, App.net and Linkedin, and see a host of stats on how your posts are performing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what makes Buffer truly amazing is its integration with third-party platforms—like Bitly. To set up your Bitly service, simply go to Settings, then Link Shortening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you go to post a link (or automatically post from your blog), Buffer will automatically shorten your link to your chosen custom short name, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Steps To Get The Most From Your Custom Short URL Using Bitly And Buffer &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/GQzOkMDIsa&quot;&gt;http://t.co/GQzOkMDIsa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; iwantmyname (@iwantmyname) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname/statuses/397791387275366400&quot;&gt;November 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>13 Platforms For Creating Customizable Online Stores</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a product to sell and an ounce of sticktuitiveness, the barrier for entry into the world of online sales is less daunting than ever. Just pick a platform, select and tweak a template, take some product shots and you&amp;#39;re up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with such a bounty of offerings, choosing which platform to start with can be a job in itself. Do you go with a full-featured site platform? Something targeted towards e-commerce? A niche field?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of our favorites to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-05-Screen_Shot_2013-11-04_at_12.38.33.png&quot; alt=&quot;Big Cartel&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bigcartel.com&quot;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt; is one of the biggest ecommerce platforms on the web, primarily focusing on designers, artists, bands and other creative folks. Most notably, Big Cartel has some great templates you can tweak (no code needed, but you can use your own CSS/HTML if you want), and a host of analytics tools to track your activity and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans run from free for five products (one image per) to $29.99/mo for 300 products (five images per) and a number of extra benefits including inventory tracking and the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&quot;&gt;custom domain names&lt;/a&gt;. And best of all &amp;quot;Big Cartel does not charge any listing or per transaction fees. The normal PayPal fees still apply.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra credit:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&amp;#39;s the cool story of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://100k.bigcartel.com&quot;&gt;100,000th Big Cartel store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Squarespace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as customizability goes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most intuitive platforms on the web. With its simple &amp;quot;Layout Engine&amp;quot; editing interface, you can make your sites, blogs and stores look just how you want them to, and with an impressive list of third-party integrations, your shops can be more flexible than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up shop for business is a premium Squarespace offering, and costs $24.99/mo billed annually or $30 month-to-month. But with that, you get no transaction fees (normal &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/us/pricing&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; fees still apply), unlimited products, pages and storage, inventory tracking, page analytics and tax, shipping and coupon control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/45734056?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tictail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://tictail.com&quot;&gt;Tictail&lt;/a&gt; may not have the full site capabilities of a platform like Squarespace (although it isn&amp;#39;t that far off), it may just be the easiest platform for setting up a store. It&amp;#39;s so easy in fact, that you can sign up with your Facebook and Twitter account, pick a template (CSS and HTML customization is available), set some basic information up in the dashboard and launch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a pricing standpoint, Tictail is rather interesting. For many users, starting up a store and getting started with Paypal is free. From Tictail, &amp;quot;That means no monthly fees, zero percentage cut on transactions, no product caps like limited number of products or bandwidth and no additional checkout fees (normal PayPal and Klarna fees still apply).&amp;quot; Where money does come into play is with the advanced features available in their &amp;quot;app store.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.tictail.com/customer/portal/articles/1324711-what-do-the-apps-cost-&quot;&gt;Prices vary per item&lt;/a&gt;, and include features like the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/tictail-store-custom-domain&quot;&gt;custom domains&lt;/a&gt;, Zopim live chat, discount services and a nice list builder for community building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/51595653?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Shopify&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the storefronts of yesteryear, the best way to catch a customers eye is to look clean and fresh. And with more than 100 themes in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.shopify.com&quot;&gt;Theme Store&lt;/a&gt; (including plenty of great responsive options), you should be covered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopify.com&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;. Tack on a full-featured CMS, tons of third-party integrations and advanced marketing tools and you have yourself quite a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starter plans start at $14/mo, and give you the ability to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;custom domains&lt;/a&gt;, 25 products and 1 GB file storage. Advanced plans go all the way to $179/mo, and give you unlimited everything, preferred transaction fees, professional reports and basically anything anyone would ever need to run a professional business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;SupaDupa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-05-Screen_Shot_2013-11-04_at_12.47.05.png&quot; alt=&quot;SupaDupa&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something refreshingly honest about &lt;a href=&quot;http://supadupa.me&quot;&gt;SupaDupa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s mission statement, &amp;quot;We didn&amp;#39;t set out to build something for everyone, our job is not to appeal to the most people, it&amp;#39;s to create a place for the people who care about the things we care about, like beauty, truth and making things to love, with love.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geared primarily towards clothing designers, SupaDupa offers more than 45 professionally designed themes, and all the stability and security you&amp;#39;d want with a professional store. Plans start at free for 10 products (one image per), then incrementally rise to the unlimited plan for $49/mo, which give you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/supadupa-custom-domain&quot;&gt;custom domain capabilities&lt;/a&gt;, full design control and preferred processing fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Airsquare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Templates are wonderful tools for users with no design background to create online stores, but wouldn&amp;#39;t it just be easier to have someone do it for you? Well, for $660, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airsquare.com/&quot;&gt;Airsquare&lt;/a&gt; will do just that--or you could choose from a wide selection of responsive templates with customizable layouts, fonts and colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online shops cost $39/mo, and include a 1% transaction fee, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/airsquare-custom-domain&quot;&gt;custom domain usage&lt;/a&gt;, free email marketing tools and $5 upgrades for custom email addresses and Xero, MailChimp and Vend integration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enstore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, a great company called Sofa was acquired by Facebook, leaving Checkout and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enstore.com&quot;&gt;Enstore&lt;/a&gt; to be split off from Versions and Kaleidoscope to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acclivitysoftware.com&quot;&gt;Acclivity&lt;/a&gt;, a big player in the ecommerce world. My history may be a bit fuzzy there, but today, Enstore is now as viable as ever—and is totally free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Free. The way it works is that Enstore gives you all the basics you&amp;#39;d need to run an ecommerce site. Fully customizable design, Google hosting, an integrated shopping cart and payments through most major merchants. But when your store gets serious, you can plug in Checkout and AccountEdge (two paid Acclivity products) to really go pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Goodsie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Big Cartel and a few of the other platforms on the list, &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodsie.com&quot;&gt;Goodsie&lt;/a&gt; is a platform designed for small-to-medium sized stores. But unlike some of the others, Goodsie makes design customizations incredibly easy with a visual CSS interface. And with a number of polished themes to make your own, it&amp;#39;s a great platform for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodsie plans start at $30/mo and have no transaction fees, unlimited products and hosting space and access to just about any payment system out there via Braintree, Paypal, Stripe, Google and Authorize.net. Premium sites with advanced shipping logistics and email marketing are $75/mo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/73781961?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jimdo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 million sites created. Easy store creation. A well-made iOS app for mobile access. There&amp;#39;s a lot to like about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimdo.com&quot;&gt;Jimdo&lt;/a&gt;, the Hamburg-based platform created for simple site building in 2007, but perhaps the nicest feature is the ability to create and launch a bare-bones store for free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the features you&amp;#39;ll want for your store start at $90/yr then jump to $240/yr for a business account. Paid features include &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/jimdo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;custom domain names&lt;/a&gt;, payment options including checks (paper ones!) and advanced site design customizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Magento Go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the ecommerce ecosystem is easy these days, but using a platform owned by eBay—possibly the largest ecommerce site ever—isn&amp;#39;t a bad way to go. And with some huge companies like Nike, Toms and Breville using the Enterprise Edition, you know you&amp;#39;ll be in good company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of running a small business store, we recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/magento-go?icid=topnav&quot;&gt;Magento Go&lt;/a&gt;, with customizable designs, infinite product options and a handful of customer engagement tools to get your store going. Prices run from $15/mo to $125/mo, all with no transaction fees, access to all the Magento tools and ample space for stores of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Storenvy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-05-Screen_Shot_2013-11-04_at_12.52.18.png&quot; alt=&quot;Storenvy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of the other platforms on the list feature infinite individuality, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storenvy.com&quot;&gt;Storenvy&lt;/a&gt; thrives in providing a large Etsy-like storefront for all its sites to feature their wares (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.storenvy.com/products/3201786-merry&quot;&gt;this lovely shirt&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t fret, Storenvy also lets you setup your own site, complete with custom CSS/HTML (or templates), easy inventory tracking and up to 500 products for free. And for just $5/mo, you can use your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/storenvy-custom-domain-registration&quot;&gt;custom domain&lt;/a&gt;—the most important step for any savvy business owner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flying Cart&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big stores, small stores—&lt;a href=&quot;http://flyingcart.com&quot;&gt;Flying Cart&lt;/a&gt; can handle them all with workmanlike efficiency. Take control of your code or use a template, then use a mass of backend tools and services, like social integration, inventory tracking and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/customize-flyingcart-with-your-own-domain&quot;&gt;custom domain&lt;/a&gt; usage to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans run from $9.99/mo for 25 products to $349.99/mo for 20,000 products, email hosting, phone support and advanced product management tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Virb&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving you the built-in tools needed to set up your own store, &lt;a href=&quot;http://virb.com&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; teamed up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.virb.com/customer/portal/articles/357140-integrating-big-cartel-with-virb&quot;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.virb.com/customer/portal/articles/1031401-creating-an-etsy-store-page-on-virb&quot;&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; to allow for easy store/product imports. And given Virb&amp;#39;s track record of cool updates and add-ons, we&amp;#39;d recommend giving them a look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;

				<title>Fiji Time: Working From An Island In The Pacific Ocean</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-01-the-iwmn-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iwantmyname Fiji office&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iwantmyname team just got back from a two-week stay in Fiji where we spent time together working, brainstorming and dreaming big. Why Fiji, you ask? As you may know, our company is based in New Zealand, and the Pacific island nation is just a short 2.5 hour flight from here, making it an affordable destination for a team outing. One of our goals when launching iwantmyname almost 5 years ago was to set up the company in a way so that we could work completely independent of our location (as long as there&amp;#39;s an internet connection), so we wanted to put our goal to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 13 we left on two separate flights from Auckland to Nadi, Fiji. Our first stop after landing was a local telco shop at the airport to buy local SIM cards for data. The plan was to set up our own wireless network over 3G and use simple tethering via our phones as a backup option. As you can imagine, good internet connectivity is crucial for us, so a side reason for picking Fiji is because of their direct connection to an undersea data cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-01-fiji-speedtest.png&quot; alt=&quot;fiji-speedtest.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools we used to create our own network were two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sapido.com.tw/EN/productmb1132o_35g.htm&quot;&gt;Sapido MB-1132 3G/4G travel routers&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huaweidevice.com/worldwide/productFeatures.do?pinfoId=2940&amp;amp;directoryId=5008&amp;amp;treeId=582&amp;amp;tab=0&quot;&gt;Huawei E372 USB sticks&lt;/a&gt; connected to an external antenna, which gave us enough bandwidth to do work. We&amp;#39;ve been using the same setup all over New Zealand while traveling, camping and backpacking already, and Vodafone Fiji didn&amp;#39;t disappoint with their 3G speed. Prices were reasonable too, with ~$40 USD for 6 GB of data, which you could top up online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everything in place, we kicked off our first week just as if we were at our normal office. The only difference was the warm weather, the pool and the ocean waves just in front of our house, which we made use of extensively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideegeo/sets/72157637176202473/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-01-flickr-set.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fiji Flickr Set&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a break in Fiji? Just jump in the pool or go for a swim, snorkle or kayak in the crystal-clear ocean. This helped us tremendously to get our minds off the tasks we planned to achieve during our stay (e.g. after staring at a screen for hours, writing complicated code or fixing bugs). The main goal for this trip was to automate the last bits and pieces of our system, improve internal admin tools and performing some cleanup tasks. Quite often our workflow looked like &amp;quot;git push &amp;gt; deploy &amp;gt; jump in pool&amp;quot;. It was such an intense, focused and productive two weeks, and having the team in a beautiful and relaxed work environment certainly made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we also explored the island, with the highlight being a hiking trip to a local waterfall. Check out the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHU8WciU_6Q&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some of us got sick after trying some local specialties in week two, but that didn&amp;#39;t stop us from enjoying the rest of our stay. I&amp;#39;d say on a tropical island it just adds to the experience... ;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had clear goals that we wanted to achieve and we hit most of them. But more importantly, the team got closer to each other by sharing rooms, cooking meals together and just having a good time. It went so well, we&amp;#39;re planning to go on team outings like this on a yearly basis now. Would we go to Fiji again? Certainly! It&amp;#39;s close to New Zealand, affordable and offers good internet connectivity for a remote island. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to come with us next year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/backend-developer&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;re hiring&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Droplr For Sharing Files And Taking Screenshots</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For a bigger, more updated look at Droplr, head over to our new post, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/08/droplr-is-an-exceptionally-useful-tool.html&quot;&gt;Droplr is an exceptionally useful tool for sharing files and screenshots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-02-screen800x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Droplr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;a href=&quot;https://droplr.com/hello&quot;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt;, this was a pretty typical conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, take a look at the box in the bottom right corner of your screen.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;m on my phone. I think I&amp;#39;m seeing something different.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you see what&amp;#39;s happening on this page?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;No, it&amp;#39;s not happening on my browser.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a million reasons why someone would need to send a screenshot, and with Droplr, there&amp;#39;s now an incredibly easy way to send one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Droplr Mac, Windows or iOS App (or a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://droplr.com/hello#&quot;&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt;), taking a screenshot is as easy as hitting a hotkey combo, drawing a box anywhere on the screen, then sharing the URL Droplr provides of the image you took. You can also use Droplr to shorten links in your browser, write and share PlainText/Markdown drafts of documents, share code and send large files with Droplr and send them to anyone you please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, it may be the easiest platform for sharing files on the internet, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for $5.99/mo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://droplr.com/hello#pro&quot;&gt;Droplr Pro&lt;/a&gt; gives you advanced statistics, the ability to share files up to 1GB and custom domains for the files you send. For a business, sending links with custom short domain names (like iwmn.me) is always nice touch of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Drew Wilson, Co-Creator Of Roon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-11-01-roon-520.png&quot; alt=&quot;roon-520.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks so much for chatting! First off, tell me a little about what makes Roon a great blog platform for someone like me—a guy who just wants to blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for the opportunity! Roon was built to make it super easy to go from sign up to your first published post as fast as you can type. There are no settings to configure before posting your content and it&amp;#39;ll look great on all devices. We do have optional settings for those who&amp;#39;d like to customize their Roon blog a bit, but he interface and the platform was designed to put all the focus on the writing experience and not the level of visual customization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roon also doesn&amp;#39;t claim ownership over your content as other platforms do, and you can export your entire blog at anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of platforms lately go practically CMS-free, but Roon has a web app, an iOS app and a Mac app on the way. That&amp;#39;s a pretty impressive lineup! Do you think it makes for a better user experience that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; 100%! Writing in a native app is a much better experience than writing in a web app. Giving people the options to use these native apps for free only makes the Roon platform that much more convenient and really sets it apart from all the other competitors out there. Native apps are also quicker to pull up, making it more convenient to jot ideas down as drafts when they come to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems that every day I see a new Twitter post screaming &amp;quot;DON&amp;#39;T READ THE COMMENTS.&amp;quot; Given that Roon doesn&amp;#39;t have comments for posts, give me your thoughts on author/audience interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; We purposefully did not add traditional comments to Roon because they aren&amp;#39;t the right way for authors to engage and converse with their readers. Twitter is a much better platform for comments than a traditional comment thread at the bottom of a post because it forces people to be concise with what they say. We plan to move beyond Twitter and implement our own commenting system to Roon in the future, but it will not be a traditional comment thread system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So Roon is free at the moment, and that always scares me a bit. Will Roon always be free?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; Roon will always be free, with various features available as paid upgrades. We already have two paid upgrades: Custom Domains and Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom Domains gets you the ability to run room on your own domain. Analytics enables you to add in 3rd party analytics tracking, like GoSquared or Google Analytics. We&amp;#39;ll be adding more Roon specific tracking the Analytics package soon. We also have a few more paid upgrades that will launch soon. Blogging on Roon will always be free though, as will our native apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And finally, what does the future look like for Roon? Any amazing new features coming soon? Plans for world domination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; We have tons of great plans for Roon. But both Sam and I know the full future of Roon will be something we can&amp;#39;t predict. Just like most other platforms, the community has a huge part in the future of the product. We&amp;#39;re excited to see where that leads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just around the corner we&amp;#39;ll be launching Multi-Blog. Everyone will be able to manage multiple blogs under their one username. You&amp;#39;ll have a dedicated blog URL for each of your blogs, as well as a new &amp;quot;User Page&amp;quot; that will be a mash up of all your posts from all your blogs combined. Multi-Blog will be free for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that we&amp;#39;ll be launching Discovery. It will be available on the web and in our native apps and you&amp;#39;ll be able to browse posts from others. Discovery will bring the Roon community together and will make it easy for you to find and read posts written by others that you&amp;#39;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we&amp;#39;re just focused on making a great platform for people to write great content and not worry about spending time to make it look good. We take care of it all for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Drew on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drewwilson&quot;&gt;@drewwilson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With iwantmyname Customer Lee Crossley</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-30-A6clKGTCQAA75He.jpg-large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lee Crossley Big&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Lee, thanks for doing our very first user interview! So first, tell me a bit about yourself and what you&amp;#39;re up to these days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m a full stack developer and general level-headed guy, who gets the job done right and on time. For the past 5 years I&amp;#39;ve been the technical director at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clickinnovate.com&quot;&gt;Click Innovate&lt;/a&gt;. I love to attend hack events and contribute to open source as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So you just got a new domain. If you don&amp;#39;t mind me asking, what is it? And what are you using it for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve registered a few domains with iwantmyname and this most recent one was for a mobile based assassin game called &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/77907408&quot;&gt;appsassin&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;appsass.in&amp;quot;. It was registered for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ilee.co.uk/yet-another-hackathon-victory/&quot;&gt;hack event I&amp;#39;ve just won&lt;/a&gt;. Who wouldn&amp;#39;t love a game where you assassinate other players with your mobile phone? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Congrats on your win! So here&amp;#39;s a deep one. ICANN is just now starting to roll out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (extensions like .blog, .music and .dad). Give me some thoughts. Think they&amp;#39;ll take off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; Good question. I think there will always be a primary urge to snap up a &amp;quot;.com,&amp;quot; but with so many registered I&amp;#39;ve recently turned to .io and other TLDs that can incorporate the name. The new TLDs are clearly going to be successful (some more than others), even if only due to current exhaustion. I&amp;#39;d register a .app for sure for an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Self promotion time. Tell us something the world should know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; I love to write and record music when I have free/spare time. The last time was in 2010 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://open.spotify.com/track/00k6x6Vzj8OaecWMHTi4is&quot;&gt;you can listen for free on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And last but not least, what should I eat for dinner tonight? I have a really hard time making these decisions on my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; Steak (rare) with chilli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Well said, Lee. Well said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Roon Makes Blogging As Easy As Possible</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-30-Screen_Shot_2013-10-29_at_13.39.27.png&quot; alt=&quot;Roon Top&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing to think how much the blogging world has changed in the last 10-15 years. In just a short period of time, we&amp;#39;ve gone completely full circle, from plain HTML to terrible WYSIWYG editors to less terrible WYSISYG editors to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;—a simplified version of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up shop in the modern realm of Markdown blog platforms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roon.io/&quot;&gt;Roon&lt;/a&gt; is unquestionably built with the blogger in mind. Once you sign up (it&amp;#39;s free), you&amp;#39;re presented with a distraction-free screen with a pane for writing, a pane for managing content and familiar icons dedicated to inserting images, previewing posts, editing text and posting to social platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less obvious is where to find your settings (hint: your image on the bottom left is a button). But within these settings options are all the customization tools available--and some of them are quite important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use a custom domain name in Roon, but it costs $12/yr. A modest price considering the free cost of the service. Once you get to this point, don&amp;#39;t forget to install Roon in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname marketplace&lt;/a&gt;--it makes adding your domain name a cinch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics can be used, but unlocking the tool to input your tracking code costs another $12/yr. Again, a modest price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no HTML/CSS customization options. Just a toggle between a serif/sans serif font, an input for an accent color and some bio entry tools. Before you start with Roon, get a good look at what the template looks like. It&amp;#39;s clean, easy to read and responsive, but if you don&amp;#39;t like it, maybe this platform isn&amp;#39;t for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a wonderful export button that lets you export your content if you ever choose to move platforms. Not that you should be looking to leave, but if you do, the Roon team sends you a nice folder with all your posts in Markdown file format. I kind of love that they do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-30-giant.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-29 at 14,07,56&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id634949849&quot;&gt;iOS app&lt;/a&gt; available for mobile posting, and it comes complete with all the tools available on the web app. If you get your hands on an iPad with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://goincase.com/shop/incase-origami-workstation-for-ipad-2&quot;&gt;Incase Origami&lt;/a&gt; and Apple keyboard, there&amp;#39;s really no need here for a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s...the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thought:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing I really like about Roon is that it purposefully doesn&amp;#39;t include a comment system. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://roon.io/support/&quot;&gt;Roon Support&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;if you add your Twitter username to your Roon account your readers will be able to comment on your posts via Twitter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/whats_fair&quot;&gt;old post&lt;/a&gt; from John Gruber on Daring Fireball:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write on your site; I write on mine...What makes DF an efficient and effective soapbox is exactly that it is not noisy. My goal is for not a single wasted word to appear anywhere on any page of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>An Easier Way To Migrate Your Email Accounts</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-29-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;YippieMove&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the business world of today, few things scream &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t get the internet!&amp;quot; more than sending company emails from non-branded email accounts. It&amp;#39;s not that platforms like gmail and Hotmail aren&amp;#39;t secure or stable enough for businesses, there&amp;#39;s just a level of professionalism and polish associated with an address like chris@iwantmyname.com versus iwantmynamechris@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;ve been using a gmail (or Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc.) account for your business for any length of time, transferring to something custom branded can be incredibly time consuming. You have to download your emails, back them up so they won&amp;#39;t get lost, then re-sync them while praying nothing goes wrong. Depending on your platform, it could take hours, or even days to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you could just use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yippiemove.com&quot;&gt;YippieMove&lt;/a&gt;. With YippieMove, you can transfer all your emails from more than 100 preconfigured email providers without any slowdowns or data loss (your emails and attachments will be identical copies, not a gibberish mess). And because it&amp;#39;s all completed through YippieMove servers, and any errors or snags you&amp;#39;d normally have to deal with are handled smoothly by their support team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no hassle, no fuss, and it works with all the standard email hosting platforms currently available in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. So if you&amp;#39;re moving to a custom email platform soon, I&amp;#39;d recommend giving YippieMove a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Credit:&lt;/strong&gt; If you need any help setting up a custom email address, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&quot;&gt;here&amp;#39;s a good place to start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Another Domain Registration Scam To Watch Out For</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to get scammed, but we see it happen to people all the time. And while scamming techniques are constantly becoming more and more sophisticated, you can always protect yourself by being aware of who you&amp;#39;re sending money to and what you&amp;#39;re paying for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a scam we&amp;#39;ve seen going around recently. It looks pretty real, but the truth is in the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Email.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-26-domain-scam-email-blog-size.png&quot; alt=&quot;domain-scam-email-blog-size.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wording here is very tricky, basically telling you that if you don&amp;#39;t send money, &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; offer will expire—not your domain, which they&amp;#39;re trying to trick you into transferring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on a side note, here&amp;#39;s the deal with anyone offering search engine submission or search engine optimization (SEO). There&amp;#39;s no magic button. No secret guy you can pay off. Most platforms on the web now have some sort of SEO built in, and any sort of real SEO work takes time, relevant content and a plan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before you pay for anything, know what you&amp;#39;re getting yourself into. If it sounds like hocus-pocus, it probably is. Do your research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The payment page.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-26-domain-scam-site-blog-size.png&quot; alt=&quot;domain-scam-site-blog-size.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click through, the payment page is even sneakier than the email. No information, real payment verification logos and a legitimate-looking form asking you for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the rule. If you&amp;#39;re on a URL other than iwantmyname.com or didn&amp;#39;t receive the invoice from an email address ending in &amp;#39;@iwantmyname.com&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;@support.iwantmyname.com&amp;#39;, don&amp;#39;t trust it. And if you&amp;#39;re ever unsure about a payment, just send us a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Credit:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t get scammed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/dont-get-scammed-by-domain-registry-of-america.html&quot;&gt;Domain Registry of America&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/beware-of-domain-renewal-scams.html&quot;&gt;Domain Renewal Group&lt;/a&gt; either!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.nz Coming Soon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-26-bigstock-A-mob-of-Merinos-in-New-Zealan-45486025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bigstock-A-mob-of-Merinos-in-New-Zealan-45486025.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has a lot more going on than just sheep and Hobbits. Being based in New Zealand we&amp;#39;re especially excited to report that steps are well underway to finally bring the second level domain .nz to the public very soon. This aligns New Zealand with most other jurisdictions that already allow registrations at the second level, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us-american-domain-name-registration-for-usa&quot;&gt;.us&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot;&gt;.eu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.co&lt;/a&gt; domains, to name but a few. It also opens up previously unsurveyed domain space that will no doubt be eagerly sought after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the most popular domain extension in New Zealand is the third level extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; which is largely populated by the local business community. Opening up the .nz domain landscape will create new branding and promotional opportunities plus some amusing (and valuable) domain hack possibilities. How about thefo.nz, ipo.nz, cartoo.nz ? Let your imagination run wild!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further public consultation on the proposal is likely in 2014 and no firm date has been set for implementation as yet; but the ball is rolling and gathering pace it seems. In the meantime we&amp;#39;d love to help you keep in touch as developments unfold further. Shortly we will start taking expressions of interest, so that we can let you know what&amp;#39;s happening well ahead of the actual .nz launch. Of course there&amp;#39;s no obligation whatsoever. Don&amp;#39;t miss out on adding this new domain to your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Buffer For Social Posting And Analytics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-26-logo-dark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;logo-dark.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s really no way around it anymore (unless you&amp;#39;re a mega-company like Apple)—social media is kind of a necessary tool for doing business. It lets you interact with people using your products, and it gives you a pretty huge soapbox to talk to the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s an interesting balance you face when mixing general conversations with support questions, important messages and links to posts and new pages. How much is too much? What clicks with your audience? What&amp;#39;s the science behind all this madness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://bufferapp.com/&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;. Buffer is a social tool that lets us send messages through all of our social channels (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/112962523733159717427/posts&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.app.net/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;App.net&lt;/a&gt;) at once. But the magic happens when you start timing posts, then checking post analytics to see how something did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does being funny work? Do people like links from around the internet? Can I get away with posting about my dog (ok, that&amp;#39;s never happened)? With Buffer, you can visually see how many retweets and likes you got. Or how many clicks a post got on each platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And best of all, Buffer hooks up with a number of third-party platforms to make social even better. For instance, when we post blogs now, Buffer automatically posts them on all our platforms at our next scheduled posting time using Zapier (IFTTT also works). And the link used by Buffer is automatically shortened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-tools-we-use-bitly-for-link-shortening.html&quot;&gt;iwnt.my/XXXXXX with our synched-up Bit.ly account&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s really quite amazing, and the list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bufferapp.com/extras&quot;&gt;platforms available&lt;/a&gt; is very impressive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re doing social for your brand (or yourself?), give it a shot. We definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra credit:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to providing this super-handy platform, Buffer also publishes some interesting articles on social analytics. Here&amp;#39;s a good one, titled, &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-post-to-facebook-send-emails-publish-blogposts&quot;&gt;A scientific guide to posting Tweets, Facebook posts, Emails and Blog posts at the best time.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How To Transfer Your gTLD (.com .net .org .info, .biz, .name, .mobi) To iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; This guide is for transferring gTLDs only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a definition. In the world of domain registrars, the term TLD stands for Top Level Domain—basically, the bit at the end of your domain name. More granularly, a generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) is part of a group of extensions including .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .name and .mobi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on ICANN policy, all gTLDs require the same transfer process, which is different from country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)—some more significantly than others. So if you&amp;#39;re looking to transfer your gTLD—.com .net .org .info, .biz, .name or .mobi—to iwantmyname, please follow this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Check If Your Domain Is Old Enough.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a general 60-day transfer lock on newly registered or transferred gTLDs. To eliminate holdups, please make sure your domain has been registered longer than 60 days and has not been transferred within the last 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Some registrars also &amp;#39;lock&amp;#39; domains for transfer if the domain&amp;#39;s contact details have been changed—check your current registrar&amp;#39;s terms and conditions to find out. You should still be able to transfer a domain even if you&amp;#39;ve updated the contact details—however, you might need to contact the support team of your current registrar to assist you with the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Unlock Your Domain.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gTLDs usually have a transfer lock enabled—even if they are older than 60 days—to &amp;#39;protect&amp;#39; your domain from being transferred without your approval. Before your transfer, you need to unlock the domain, either in your current registrar&amp;#39;s management interface or by contacting their support team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Remove Whois Privacy.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to approve the domain transfer, we&amp;#39;ll need access to the domain&amp;#39;s contact email address. However, most Whois Privacy services don&amp;#39;t forward emails sent to the Whois privacy email address, which prevents necessary data from being received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Check Your Domain&amp;#39;s Contact Email Address.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have access to the domain&amp;#39;s registrant and/or admin contact email address, even if you have no Whois Privacy enabled. Without access to that email address, you will not be able to approve the transfer. And if you need to update this email address, most registrars provide a contact update function in their management interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Get The Domain&amp;#39;s Auth Code.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also called Authorization Code, EPP key, transfer key or transfer password. Some registrars provide the Auth Code in their domain management interface, and some provide a method to request the Auth Code which is then sent to the admin or registrant contact email address. Be sure to contact your current registrar&amp;#39;s support team if you need help locating the Auth Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Start The Domain Transfer.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re so close! At this point, you&amp;#39;re ready to start the transfer at https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer. Just put the domain name in the field provided and hit the &amp;quot;Go&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-25-start-transfer.png&quot; alt=&quot;start-transfer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Check The Email Address And Add The Auth Code.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next page, check the email address shown. If it&amp;#39;s an email address, you&amp;#39;ll have access to put in the Auth Code in the field provided and click &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot;. Follow the checkout process to start the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have access to the email address shown, go back to your current registrar and update the admin contact email address of your domain (Step 4). Please note that it may take a bit for the email address to update, depending on the update process of your current registrar. Continue with Step 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-25-add-auth-code.png&quot; alt=&quot;add-auth-code.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Confirm the Transfer Authorization Email.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the transfer has been started successfully, an email will be sent to the admin contact of the domain name—sometimes an email will also be sent to the registrant contact of the domain if it differs from the admin contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email will be sent from help@support.iwantmyname.com and has the subject &amp;quot;Domain Name Transfer Confirmation Needed&amp;quot;. Please check your spam folder if you can&amp;#39;t find the email in your inbox. If you can&amp;#39;t find the email anywhere, just let us know and we can re-send it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please follow the instructions in the email to approve the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Transfer Will Finalize Within 5 Days.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After confirming the email, it may take up to five days for the transfer to finalise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some registrars provide a way to expedite outgoing transfers by allowing the owner to manually approve the transfer either via email or via their domain management interface, but if your registrar doesn&amp;#39;t support such a method, the transfer will automatically complete 5 days after the Transfer Authorization Email has been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we uprooted the entire the entire team from Wellington and took up residence for a fortnight on a balmy tropical island not too distant from our shores. Make no mistake it wasn&amp;#39;t all beer and skittles, there was plenty of code written, strategising done and overdue admin sorted. It&amp;#39;s just a whole lot more fun working by the beach in your shorts with an ice cold pineapple juice near at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an outing we repeat on a yearly basis and it&amp;#39;s something we unashamedly promote as part of our drive to attract top talent...and yes, we are looking to employ at present! We are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/job-opening-back-end-blacksmith-developer.html&quot;&gt;currently seeking a back-end developer&lt;/a&gt; to support our growth globally and to help keep the iwantmyname engines oiled up and running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl, Erlang, Coffee Script, Lua, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Kyoto Tycoon, Puppet, Vagrant are part of our super stack that keep us humming, so you&amp;#39;ll need to know about at least some of these or be keen to learn. We also love open source, tech start-ups and amazing design, so if you&amp;#39;re strongly community minded and already have some interesting projects in your CV, that gets you extra bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be part of one of the coolest little global tech companies emerging out of New Zealand at present. To get in touch and find out more, fire up a console and do a dig lookup on TXT jobs.iwantmyname.com&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Tim Johnson, CEO Of Dot Kiwi</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-24-dot-kiwi-logo-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;dot-kiwi-logo-blog.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Tim. First off, I love your website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dot-kiwi.com&quot;&gt;dot-kiwi.com&lt;/a&gt;. The design is nice, the copy is fun, but once .kiwi goes live, do you plan on switching domain extensions. Maybe to something like dot.kiwi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks! The website is a result of a lot of thought and planning - we want to break industry standards (boring), and reach out to the consumer with a fun and innovative interface that brings life to domain names. We look forward to changing from our current .com URL to one of our very own .kiwi names - what will it be? Well that&amp;#39;s going to be a surprise....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re working for a smart, dynamic Kiwi company that&amp;#39;s looking to move away from the .co.nz extension. From a branding perspective, what makes .kiwi a better fit than .nz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it wasn&amp;#39;t me who said it, but there is a joke in the industry that goes something like this &amp;quot;Oh, .com? Yeah, that&amp;#39;s the domain my dad uses&amp;quot;. The joke is subtle, but powerful. New domains like .kiwi represent the fresh and exciting, probably most importantly it also means relevance. The way we see it is that the existing domains are more traditional and corporate, whereas new domains like .kiwi are fun, casual and social. The casual nature will suit SME&amp;#39;s and individuals very well, there&amp;#39;s been a gaping hole in the market for a long time. Lastly, ccTLDs tend to identify a jurisdiction or geography, .kiwi identifies the people - that is a very important distinction when it comes to the web, where geography does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Aside from sites in NZ, do you see .kiwi making an international push? I mean if MailChimp can make a chimp popular, do you think you have a chance with a really underrated bird?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Underrated and underestimated indeed - that is the definition of the challenger and the underdog. We like that position and thrive on the challenge - I think that is very Kiwi. We will do an international push, we are already doing it. I&amp;#39;m doing this interview from Miami, which is the 5th stop on a world tour of 17 cities. As Kiwis we have a story and we are proud of our achievements as a nation. So where better to tell those stories and showcase our achievements than internationally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; From an insider perspective, how did you go from dreaming up .kiwi to making it a reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Like anything you&amp;#39;ve got to keep things simple. Just identify what you need to do to launch, figure out what resources you need, and surround yourself with people who are much smarter than you! For Dot Kiwi, we have a great team with a great vision. This has been an almost 3 year process for us with a ridiculous amount of hurdles and challenges - so if we couldn&amp;#39;t maintain our vision, things would have gotten pretty tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Last but not least, when can country loving Kiwis get ahold of their .kiwi domains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Premium names will be available towards the end of November, trademark holders can apply for domain names by mid-December (Sunrise), early bird (Landrush) will start mid-Feb 2014, then first-come-first-served will start early April 2014. We will also be making a special announcement shortly regarding a limited offer in November... stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mood for one of your own? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;Pre-order your .KIWI domain today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The New Domain Extensions (gTLDs) Are Coming</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From Christine Willett - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2013/10/first-new-gtlds-get-the-green-light-for-delegation/&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come! Today, the first four domains from ICANN&amp;#39;s New Generic Top-Level Domains Program were cleared to proceed to delegation. This marks the start of a measured roll out of new gTLDs, which are designed to expand opportunities for businesses, communities and Internet users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These first new gTLDs, or strings, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;شبكة (xn--ngbc5azd) - the Arabic word for &amp;quot;Web&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Network&amp;quot;
Registry : International Domain Registry Pty. Ltd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;онлайн (xn--80asehdb) - Russian for &amp;quot;Online&amp;quot;
Registry: Core Association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;сайт (xn--80aswg) - Russian for &amp;quot;Web site&amp;quot;
Registry: Core Association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;游戏 (xn--unup4y) - Chinese for &amp;quot;Game&amp;quot;
Registry: Spring Fields, LLC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is amazing news, as we&amp;#39;ll soon be seeing more and more gTLDs (i.e. generic domain extensions like .blog and .music) roll out to the public. You can already subscribe to updates on the above mentioned top-level domains &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD&quot;&gt;.онлайн&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82&quot;&gt;.сайт&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%A9&quot;&gt;.شبكة&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F&quot;&gt;.游戏&lt;/a&gt;—we will notify as soon as further information about final launch dates and pricing comes to hand. For a more complete list of the gTLDs coming out, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://theresatldforthat.com&quot;&gt;theresatldforthat.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting Started With Silvrback</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something refreshing about blogging on a platform meant for blogging. I mean, platforms like Tumblr and Squarespace provide a nice array of writing tools and readability themes, but if you&amp;#39;re simply looking to blog without distracting bells and whistles, a platform like Silvrback is definitely what you&amp;#39;re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/own-your-content-the-rise-of-dropbox-blogging.html&quot;&gt;Dropbox blogging&lt;/a&gt; a lot recently, and how &amp;quot;owning&amp;quot; your content should be more of a priority. But one of the hurdles Dropbox blogging will have to overcome is complexity. For instance, to publish a file to a blog like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/using-scriptogram-the-normal-way-and-with-mou-iwantmyblog.html&quot;&gt;Scriptogram&lt;/a&gt;, you have to write your post locally, save it to a Dropbox folder, then trust that it&amp;#39;ll sync properly. And if you want to go back and edit it (or delete it), you have to go back into your file and make your changes, then again hope the sync works as it should. Which doesn&amp;#39;t always work out like you think it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as Dropbox platforms become more mature (and step out of permanent beta), things may become more seamless, but right now, nothing beats a platform with a clean CMS and a managed hosting platform*. And Silvrback is just that. Simply sign up for a payment plan, fiddle with a few settings options (don&amp;#39;t forget to set up your custom domain!) and you&amp;#39;re ready to write. Presto change-o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-22-Silvrback_Writing_medium.png&quot; alt=&quot;sb_float&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the setup process, the real joy of using Silvrback is the content editor. Unlike many other platforms that have you write in a confined space with a nasty case of the WYSIWYGs, Silvrback lets you write in simple Markdown, and even has a little button for toggling distractions from the screen. It&amp;#39;s just you and your content, autosaving every time you touch a key. Even image uploading is easy (one of Markdown&amp;#39;s few drawbacks). Just hit &amp;quot;Insert Image,&amp;quot; copy the link provided into your post and check it out in the preview pane. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Silvrback seems to be a writers dream. But keep following throughout the week at &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyblog.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyblog.com&lt;/a&gt; as I try to break things and cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Self hosting is obviously a better solution for some, but users looking to get started with no backend knowledge or patience for that sort of thing, managed hosting is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Find The Perfect Tumblr Theme</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-19-Screen_Shot_2013-10-18_at_15.08.40.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-18 at 15.08.40.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve gone through &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/getting-started-with-tumblr-iwantmyblog.html&quot;&gt;setting up&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/adventures-in-writing-on-tumblr-iwantmyblog.html&quot;&gt;writing on&lt;/a&gt; your Tumblr blog (Tumblog), we need to work on making it your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes Tumblr one of the most attractive platforms for ADD bloggers (aside from the plethora of posting options) is that the community is quite active and ready to contribute—meaning that there are plenty of themes available, free and paid. Here are a few good sites for finding the one that&amp;#39;s right for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/themes/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; - It&amp;#39;s always a good idea to start at the source when looking for a theme. And there are plenty to find here, including many from the sites listed below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/category/blogging/tumblr&quot;&gt;Themeforest&lt;/a&gt; - As massive and impersonal as Themeforest is, there are a ton of good themes available for Tumblr sites of all shapes and sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativemarket.com/themes/tumblr&quot;&gt;Creative Market&lt;/a&gt; - Like Themeforest, Creative Market is filled with all sorts of themes from a collection of talented designers. And the prices are fairly cheap, which is always a plus. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/tumblr&quot;&gt;Pixel Union&lt;/a&gt; - If you&amp;#39;re looking for something a little more consistently hipster (passing no judgement!), Pixel Union might be your best bet. They also have a number of grid themes that strike my fancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themecloud.co/themes/&quot;&gt;Themecloud&lt;/a&gt; - Themecloud is yet another site with nice themes, but I especially appreciate the nice layout of the homepage. And, like Pixel Union, the variety of grid themes is quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you have some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, you can make your site look any way you want. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you get going.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Bitly For Link Shortening</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-18-bitly_logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;bitly_logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the origin of the problem*. When Twitter launched not that long ago (can you believe it only started in 2006?), they chose to limit posts to 140 characters. For many, that 140 character limit created a perfect environment for short thoughts and conversations, but it was a nightmare for posting links. I mean, just look at a fairly short link like &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;#39;s at least a million characters (29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, it became very important to keep these links short. Really short. And by 2009, Twitter started using bitly as their link shortener of choice (they&amp;#39;ve since started using t.co for all sites, which doesn&amp;#39;t exactly have a custom ring to it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most users, a bitly link looks something like this: bit.ly/xxxxxxx. Basically, it turned any 25+ character link into something around 15. But why would a person or company choose to use bit.ly/xxxxxxx as opposed to something custom. Something branded. For these savvy entities that wanted a branded solution, bitly started offering &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/76740-what-s-a-custom-short-domain-and-why-do-i-want-on&quot;&gt;custom link shortening&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How It Works.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process to setup your own shortened link is shockingly simple. First, get your domain at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&quot;&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; (if you already have an iwantmyname domain, just install bitly in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com/a/sign_up&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; for a bitly account, go into Settings, click Advanced, then plug in your custom domain. Just keep in mind that to properly use a short domain, you need to get a short domain to pair with the standard domain you&amp;#39;re using. Here&amp;#39;s an example. For our shortened link, we&amp;#39;re using iwnt.my (a great example of a short &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&quot;&gt;domain hack&lt;/a&gt;). Not only is it short—it retains all the branding we know and love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you&amp;#39;re ready to post, you can either shorten your link at bitly.com, download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com/a/tools&quot;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; or use any of the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/228830-how-do-i-connect-my-bitly-account-to-other-social-&quot;&gt;third-party tools&lt;/a&gt; that work with the service (we use &lt;a href=&quot;http://droplr.com&quot;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bufferapp.com/&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, but that&amp;#39;s for another post). All work great, but some work better for different workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re interested in doing some link shortening for yourself or your brand, give &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com/&quot;&gt;bitly&lt;/a&gt; a shot. We definitely recommend it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Technically, companies like TinyURL have been in the link shortening business since 2002, but it didn&amp;#39;t really become &amp;quot;a thing&amp;quot; until Twitter came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Internet Community,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/backend-developer&quot;&gt;looking for a back-end developer&lt;/a&gt; to represent 12.5% of our small international company (we&amp;#39;re looking for employee #8). And here&amp;#39;s what we have to offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Freedom.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is a big place, and as an online company, we&amp;#39;re ok with people being located in faraway places. Our office is in beautiful Wellington, New Zealand, but if you&amp;#39;re a geek with serious coding skills in New York, Berlin, Lagos, São Paulo or anywhere else on the planet, you&amp;#39;re the perfect applicant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Awesomeness.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current stack is flexible and fun, and we&amp;#39;re using a ton of toys to make it better every day. Currently, we&amp;#39;re using modern Perl, Erlang, Coffee Script, Lua, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Kyoto Tycoon, Puppet, Vagrant—and we&amp;#39;re always looking for more.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is A Domain Hack And How Can I Make One?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in the late 90s/early 2000s, hacking got a really bad rap, but to most of the development community, there&amp;#39;s nothing malicious about it. Hacking just means using using a bunch of readily available tools to make something cool—like modifying code to make things faster or using pre-existing platforms to build new website functions. In a way, modern hacking is just the newer, nerdier version of tuning cars to get more horsepower or training dogs to get drinks out of the fridge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6W02C75-adA&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that last one was a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of all the hacks possible on the web, nothing is as accessible (or immediately gratifying) as a domain hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;  

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain hack&lt;/strong&gt; - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or phrases out of domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the vast majority of sites on the web use .com as their domain extension. apple.com. microsoft.com. nike.com. And for most brands, it makes a lot of sense—if you&amp;#39;re looking to buy yourself a new Honda, the assumption is that their website will be honda.com. But for brands and blogs that exist solely on the internet and are primarily accessed via social link or bookmark, we&amp;#39;re slowly seeing sites move away from the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt; When someone asks me about bitly link shortening, I know their URL because of their original domain name—bit.ly. That&amp;#39;s a domain hack using the .ly domain extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the first site discovery apps that gained mass popularity was Delicious, and they started with a huge domain hack--del.icio.us, using the .us domain extension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 3:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;re now even seeing many companies with .com names dabbling in domain hacking. Try goo.gl for a Google link shortener, n.pr to get to the popular US radio station, NPR, or iwantmy.name for a cool way to get to our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that while .com names are easily the most popular today, we&amp;#39;re simply running out of good options available. If you&amp;#39;re looking for something short and catchy, you&amp;#39;re practically forced to look outside of the .com realm. And in 10 years, who knows what will be left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Something To Get Your Mind Going.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to get a great domain hack for yourself, here are a few good domain extensions to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: Many of the examples are probably already taken. These are just thought starters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.es&lt;/strong&gt;: mak.es, bak.es, flak.es, cak.es, tak.es, cod.es, dat.es, pag.es, pi.es, stor.es, smor.es (yum), veggi.es, whistl.es, [YOURNAME]lik.es&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.is&lt;/strong&gt;: chris.is/moving, mike.is/blogging, soccer.is/awesome, domainhacking.is/exciting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.io&lt;/strong&gt;: rad.io, pat.io, tr.io, rat.io, aud.io, cheer.io, portfol.io, scenar.io, card.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.ch&lt;/strong&gt;: ea.ch, ou.ch, mu.ch, hun.ch, bun.ch, lun.ch, bot.ch, por.ch, rea.ch, psy.ch, quen.ch, stit.ch, retou.ch, overmat.ch, workben.ch, laun.ch, ostri.ch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.se&lt;/strong&gt;: adverti.se, wheelhou.se, hor.se, despi.se, disea.se, presi.se, verbo.se, brui.se, grea.se, impo.se, mous.se, prai.se, revi.se, cau.se, cha.se&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are countless more—you just have to be creative (also, don&amp;#39;t forget to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scrabblefinder.com/&quot;&gt;Scrabble Word Finder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://domai.nr/&quot;&gt;domai.nr&lt;/a&gt;—both are lifesavers). So get out there and have some fun with your domain name. The world of domain hacking awaits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra credit 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you noticed that the .com button has been removed from Apple&amp;#39;s mobile web browser (mobile Safari)? I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to speculate, but maybe they&amp;#39;re ushering in a post-.com era?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra credit 2&lt;/strong&gt;: There are a ton of new domain extensions coming out in 2014, including .blog, .food and .news. Check out the full list at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theresatldforthat.com/&quot;&gt;theresatldforthat.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Adventures In Writing On Tumblr</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most web platforms that make you post to a traditional desktop CMS, Tumblr gives users a million options on how and where you can write. Ok, maybe a few dozen. But before we get to the wackier methods, let&amp;#39;s start with the basics--the desktop Tumblr dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-17-Screen_Shot_2013-10-16_at_15.39.44.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-16 at 15.39.44.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, Tumblr isn&amp;#39;t your run-of-the-mill blog platform, and posting certainly isn&amp;#39;t limited to articles with standard images. Readily available is an option to post text, photos, quotes, links, chats, audio and video, and each option is designed to not promote lengthy writing. Tumblr is for microblogging--sharing small snippets of things you find interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who wants to have to go to a website to micropost? From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/email_publishing&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I post to my blog via email?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup! We&amp;#39;ve made it incredibly easy to post from your desktop or mobile phone. Just send an email with the content you&amp;#39;d like to publish to your blog&amp;#39;s custom, randomly generated email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you&amp;#39;re like me, you can write in Markdown with Mou and send the doc to Tumblr directly. It even inserts a little &amp;quot;!m&amp;quot; to the subject so Tumblr knows it to convert from Markdown before posting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-17-Screen_Shot_2013-10-16_at_20.26.50.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-16 at 20.26.50.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to get even more tricky, you can install the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/apps&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404#_=_&quot;&gt;download the app&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/tips&quot;&gt;phone in audio posts&lt;/a&gt; (seriously).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting Started With Tumblr</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-16-Screen_Shot_2013-10-15_at_14.16.14.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tumblr Dashboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little backstory here. I, as an active member of the internet, have probably started and killed close to a dozen Tumblr sites. But with new blog platforms coming into existence by the bushel, I haven&amp;#39;t done anything on the platform since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an&quot;&gt;Yahoo! acquisition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as an inquisitive soul, this happy jaunt into Tumblrland will probably be as new for me as it is for you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr, Tumblr, Tumblr. If there&amp;#39;s a blog platform on the internet anywhere near as confusing to explain as Tumblr, I&amp;#39;d be shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Tumblr is a pseudo-blog platform that&amp;#39;s painfully easy to get started on. In ten minutes, even an internet novice can get up and running, but understanding what&amp;#39;s going on is a completely different issue. It&amp;#39;s because Tumblr is also a social platform where things get liked and reblogged by brilliant minds and hyper 14-year-olds alike. It&amp;#39;s really somewhere between Blogger and Facebook, capturing a target audience that skews younger, but isn&amp;#39;t unwelcoming for anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put its popularity in perspective, here&amp;#39;s a blurb from Eric Savitz on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/24/why-2013-is-the-year-you-need-to-get-serious-about-tumblr/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers in the critical 18-34 year old demographic are hooked on Tumblr, with the average visitor spending 1.5 hours per month on the site. Today, Tumblr hosts 90 million blogs that generate more than 89 million new posts every day. This astronomical growth helped the site soar into lists of the top 10 most popular websites in the U.S. at the end of last year and is attracting significant interest from brands ranging from fashion to finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setup.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any web platform in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, Tumblr is incredibly simple to link up with an iwantmyname domain name. If you haven&amp;#39;t purchased a domain yet, just get one through &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. Since our domain (iwantmyblog.com) was already purchased and installed on Scriptogram (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-pros-and-cons-of-individual-files-our-last-day-with-scriptogram-iwantmyblog.html&quot;&gt;from last week&lt;/a&gt;), our process was just slightly more complicated. Here&amp;#39;s what I did: click Setup &amp;gt; Apps &amp;amp; Services &amp;gt; Tumblr &amp;gt; Add Tumblr &amp;gt; Remove Scriptogram &amp;gt; Install Tumblr. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it gets a little weird. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com&quot;&gt;tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt; and click &amp;quot;sign up for a new account.&amp;quot; From there, you&amp;#39;ll get to your first taste of being social—a page that instructs you to follow five people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Being social.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated before, Tumblr is a social ecosystem and a blog platform all wrapped into one strange platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Time&amp;#39;s aptly titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://techland.time.com/2013/05/19/what-is-tumblr/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Is Tumblr?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a several-thousand-word opus about something, Tumblr isn&amp;#39;t the place to do it. If you want to share a &lt;a href=&quot;http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2pjubEvYA1qzf1uxo1_250.gif&quot;&gt;moving picture of a little kid acting like a detective&lt;/a&gt; as quickly and easily as possible, Tumblr is a good place to do it. That&amp;#39;s the microblogging aspect to Tumblr. Then, other Tumblr users who like moving pictures of little kids acting like detectives can follow you on Tumblr so they&amp;#39;re sure to see every moving little-kid-acting-like-a-detective picture you post. That&amp;#39;s the social networking aspect to Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So follow five people (you can/should follow more later) and get to the dashboard (the page after the app callout—go ahead and download the app, too). As you&amp;#39;ll see, it&amp;#39;s just like any other blogging dashboard, but instead of just showing your posts, you&amp;#39;ll see posts from all the people you follow. This is your portal to the world of Tumblr. An entire ecosystem of weird Tumblogs about anything from tech news to comic books to &lt;a href=&quot;http://richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;rich kids taking selfies by their airplanes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let it sink in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-16-Screen_Shot_2013-10-14_at_11.40.11-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tumblr Domain Test&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one last thing before we&amp;#39;re done. Go to Settings then click on your Tumblr name (it&amp;#39;ll be the last option in the navigation on the left) and type in your custom domain. Since you&amp;#39;ve already set it up on iwantmyname, it should test with no issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bravo, brave soul. You&amp;#39;re now on Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Virb Goes Indie As GoDaddy Buys Media Temple</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-16-virb-box.png&quot; alt=&quot;virb-box.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great news for Virb and all the people using Virb for their creative sites and portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Brad Smith of &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://blog.virb.com/post/64122176288/big-news-from-virb&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After early meetings with GoDaddy, it quickly became apparent that we shared different visions for our website builders. So... I&amp;#39;m thrilled to announce, GoDaddy has decided Virb will be sold back to its original founder and investors, Brad Smith (that&amp;#39;s me) as well as Media Temple&amp;#39;s co-founders Demian Sellfors and John Carey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our newfound (re)independence means we&amp;#39;ll have the freedom to be nimble and move quickly to advance our product, and my team is thrilled about that opportunity. We&amp;#39;re all energized by the new advantages these changes will bring about. We will continue to be committed to improving Virb. We&amp;#39;re not taking any breaks amidst these adjustments--in fact, just the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Damian Sowers, Creator Of Silvrback</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-15-damian.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;damian.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Damian. Thanks so much for chatting with us. First off, tell me a bit about yourself and why you started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silvrback.com/&quot;&gt;Silvrback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Chris. Thanks for having me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Silvrback to scratch my own itch, so to speak. I really liked the format of Medium, but I disliked a number of things about Medium. Namely, it wasn&amp;#39;t really a blogging platform and I had no ownership over my data and the flow of users. For example, Medium often directs people to other author&amp;#39;s articles after they are done reading your piece. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked certain aspects of Svbtle. So I decided to build a bit of a hybrid system between the two platforms. The goal was to allow people to promote themselves more effectively while providing a beautiful experience for the reader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Content ownership (or ownership in general) is a big deal to us, but what, in your mind, makes ownership such a big priority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; Content ownership is becoming something that more and more users are caring about these days. The legal agreements of many Apps, including Medium, are murky to say the least. If someone is going to spend the time writing an article, they should feel confident that they actually own their own writing. Silvrback gives full ownership to it&amp;#39;s users and the legal agreement is extremely simple and easy to digest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of Medium, it seems that blogs all over the web are quickly moving towards clean, single-column designs with large fonts. Do you see that as a permanent design shift?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there is a trend these days to gravitate towards bigger fonts and clean, one-column designs because it is much more enjoyable to read. People sometimes compare big fonts to children&amp;#39;s novels, but the research is showing that most of us prefer that easy-to-read experience. The beginning days of the web were dominated by sites that tried to look as professional as possible, and some people believed that very small font sizes represented professionalism. It&amp;#39;s almost as if they were trying to make their copy look like a legal textbook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing I find very appealing about Silvrback is that it&amp;#39;s fully hosted, which makes it simple to get in and go. On the flip side, we&amp;#39;re seeing lots of new platforms come out with Dropbox hosting. What are your thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; Endless tinkering with setups and preferences is something I wanted to spare Silvrback users from. I used to waste so much time in the past customizing Wordpress or Tumblr themes. I think people should spend that time on their writing instead. With regards to Dropbox, I&amp;#39;m considering giving users the option to pull markdown documents from their public Dropbox repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok ok. One more question, and it&amp;#39;s not about blogging. You seem to be a guy with good taste—what should I eat for dinner tonight? I&amp;#39;m starving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m a big fan of garlic bread. Start with a whole loaf of Rosemary Ciabatta bread. Then coat the base with a 50/50 spread of butter/mayonnaise. (mayonnaise is key). Add chopped garlic, basil, and then top is off with three-cheese mexican cheese mix. Bake for 20 minutes and enjoy a little slice of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; ... [falls into food delirium]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Ghost Is Open To The Public. Announces A $5,000 Theming Competition.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-15-b193f8cb64ed847dedcb99f743531028_large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ghost Trio&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ghost.org/public-launch/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are very proud to announce the first public release of the Ghost blogging platform to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following three weeks of intense testing after &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ghost.org/launch/&quot;&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; to our 6,000 Kickstarter backers, today we are releasing an updated Ghost 0.3.2 to everyone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who haven&amp;#39;t read up about Ghost yet, it&amp;#39;s a wonderfully simple blog platform designed to give writers the ability to write without any of the hassle associated with more robust site-building platforms like Wordpress and Squarespace (here&amp;#39;s a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://john.onolan.org/ghost&quot;&gt;original &amp;quot;manifesto&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re a designer, you also might want to check out the $5,000 Most Wanted Competition. It looks like a great way to get your name out to (and support) the Ghost community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our launch partners &lt;a href=&quot;http://envato.com/&quot;&gt;Envato&lt;/a&gt; today announced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/envatos-most-wanted-5000-for-ghost-themes/110967&quot;&gt;$5,000 Most Wanted Competition&lt;/a&gt; to seed their brand new Ghost Themes category on ThemeForest.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Something To Read Over The Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need something interesting to read this weekend? Here are some sites and articles we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.domains4good.org/&quot;&gt;Domains4good&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domains4Good puts unused domains to good use by redirecting them to top social causes. Social causes are selected and voted upon by the Domains4Good community, and each day a new social cause is featured across all domains in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Todd Hoff - &lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/10/7/ask-hs-is-microsoft-the-right-technology-for-a-scalable-web.html&quot;&gt;High Scalability&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft licenses(OS, SQL Server, ...)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Damian Sowers - &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsowers.silvrback.com/silvrback-is-now-open-to-everyone&quot;&gt;Silvrback&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m proud to announce that Silvrback is out of the pre-order phase and is now open to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Rob N - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fastmail.fm/2013/10/07/fastmails-servers-are-in-the-us-what-this-means-for-you/&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware, there have been many reports recently of secret data mining programs conducted by the US government. These reports have included mention of secret network interception and &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot; access to private email accounts. While we have no position on the veracity of these claims, we have had many queries about what, if anything, this might mean for us and for our customers, given that our primary servers are located in the US. This is our response to those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Rya Stansky - &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-for-musicians&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Squarespace 6, our aim has been to provide photographers, artists, and other creative professionals a better way to present their work online. Today, we&amp;#39;re excited to announce more features for musicians, beginning with Audio Collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kyle York - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/posts/20131008_where_are_the_most_popular_websites_in_the_world_are_hosted/?utm_content=buffere625e&amp;amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Buffer&quot;&gt;CircleID&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is pretty much the dominant player worldwide with Baidu as the dominant force in China and Korea. But I couldn&amp;#39;t help but wonder what the most popular website based in each country was. So, I put the Dyn research team to work and they came up with a comprehensive list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Chris Hall - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/iwantmyblog-the-blog-that-goes-everywhere.html&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, a lot has happened in the blogging world. Templates got better. Responsive design became a thing. Social media went bananas. There&amp;#39;s quite a bit of catching up to do, and a ton of new blog platforms to try out. All said, it&amp;#39;s going to take an incredible amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to make it easier for myself, I&amp;#39;m giving each blog platform a solid week. With my trusty iwantmyblog.com domain name in hand, I&amp;#39;ll work fast to build a basic site on Monday, spend the middle of the week writing about the platform and be out by the end of Friday. Then, with a clean URL and (hopefully) a mess of content in some sort of export file, I&amp;#39;ll take my blog on the road to the next platform. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy reading... and have a great weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Pros And Cons Of Individual Files. Our Last Day With Scriptogram</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-12-Screen_Shot_2013-10-11_at_15.03.19.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-11 at 15.03.19.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the internet is a fragile beast. You can make all the backups you want, but unless you can access each of your files individually, it&amp;#39;s hard to feel totally secure. Fortunately, using a Dropbox-based blog platform like Scriptogram, you can take all your posts with you, no matter where you want to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now that we&amp;#39;re leaving Scriptogram to try out our next blog platform, it&amp;#39;s time to package everything up into one tiny package. In your Dropbox folder, go to Apps -&amp;gt; Scriptogram and then move all your content to a good place. That&amp;#39;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where the challenge lies. Unlike leaving a platform like Wordpress which gives you a big file you can just import somewhere else, Dropbox blogging keeps all your posts separated. That means you have to import them one-by-one unless you&amp;#39;re moving to another Dropbox platform (you also might have to strip out the Markdown formatting, depending on the platform)—a real drag if you&amp;#39;re moving to something like Squarespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look at the bright side. At least you know all your data is all there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Customizing Your Scriptogram Site</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-11-Screen_Shot_2013-10-10_at_23.29.28.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-10 at 23.29.28.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re a writer—a good writer—and all you want to do is write to your heart&amp;#39;s content. You get yourself a nice  blog, pump out a few posts and look at your work. It&amp;#39;s nice, but not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a writer like me, you want things look great, but without a background in design, you don&amp;#39;t exactly know what great entails. Do you want big fonts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeldman.com/&quot;&gt;Zeldman&lt;/a&gt; or tiny fonts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Gruber&lt;/a&gt;? Colors? Full width? Responsive layouts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the deal. When dealing with a blog platform, the more popular they are, the more templates and simple customization options they&amp;#39;ll likely have. In this case, Scriptogram is still on the small side--ten themes with only CSS and HTML customization options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t bore you with a description of all ten themes here, but I will talk about my favorite three. When looking for a blog template, I tend to prefer large fonts with nice typography and few distracting colors. And fortunately, Scriptogram has a few good options: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readnik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readnik is a clean template using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Crimson+Text&quot;&gt;Crimson Text&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/a&gt; (I think) to simulate a nice newspaper feel. It doesn&amp;#39;t have a ton of personality, but Readnik is really easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typographic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Serif&quot;&gt;Droid Serif&lt;/a&gt; for a header font might sound boring, but at 100px anything is interesting. And when it does this not-so-subtle fade-to-white thing, it&amp;#39;s really striking. Here&amp;#39;s the downside—&lt;a href=&quot;http://sicanstudios.com/post/teehan-lax-navigation/&quot;&gt;you have to code in your own navigation&lt;/a&gt;. The directions are pretty straightforward, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t exactly call Typographic a &amp;quot;plug and play&amp;quot; theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, sure. I completely understand not wanting to use the default theme, but Basic is pretty nice. Aside from the fairly conservative &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/regular/&quot;&gt;Proxima Nova&lt;/a&gt; font, it utilizes a pretty neat parallax header effect that&amp;#39;s pretty neat. Try it out for yourself on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptogr.am/blog&quot;&gt;Scriptogram blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Customization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Scriptogram (for some) is that all the themes are created using fairly straightforward CSS and HTML. If you really want to dive in and mess with a theme, you can, but adding your own theme requires a submission process. And given my lack of dev experience (and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.scriptogr.am/kb/creating-themes/submitting-a-theme&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; that seems to be down at the moment), I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure how the process works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the customization options for Scriptogram are pretty limited at this point. In its current form, some basic things are still unnecessarily hard (like placing logos), but keep in mind that the platform is still in beta. Hopefully more customization options will appear in the final version.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: HipChat For Internal Communication</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-11-Screen_Shot_2013-10-10_at_11.20.25.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-10 at 11.20.25.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when you&amp;#39;re a relatively small business with an office in beautiful Wellington, NZ, communication between employees is tough. People go out of town. Decide to all work remotely at 2am. Things happen. So when we need to chat without vocal chords, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be clear here, HipChat isn&amp;#39;t just a rebranded version of AIM—it does some pretty amazing things. For starters, it makes for a great information repository. Grab one person, or set up a &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; for a specific group or team and you can share PDFs, docs and images by just dragging and dropping your files. And when you need to bring in a tweet (something we use quite often), just paste the tweet URL and it shows up like it would in your Twitter client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for dev teams, HipChat&amp;#39;s integration with Bitbucket, GitHub and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.hipchat.com/knowledgebase/topics/10037-integrations&quot;&gt;slew of other tools and apps&lt;/a&gt; on the web makes it invaluable. I won&amp;#39;t go into specific details, but every time just about anything goes wrong, gets changed/updated or completed, it&amp;#39;s saved until the end of time on a running HipChat list (did we mention the complete chat history and 256-bit SSL encryption?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HipChat is also great when you&amp;#39;re completely mobile. Using the HipChat app (available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hipchat/id418168984?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipchat&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;), you have all the functionality of the desktop app right in your hands. And with email and mobile push notifications, you&amp;#39;ll never miss anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in trying a new &amp;quot;chat&amp;quot; tool, you can check out HipChat &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipchat.com/pricing&quot;&gt;free for 30 days&lt;/a&gt;, then just $2/user/month after that (it&amp;#39;s always free for teams of five and under). We definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using Scriptogram The Normal Way, And With Mou</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of Scriptogram, there&amp;#39;s a right way to post articles, and then my way. Because I&amp;#39;m a sucker for convenience, let&amp;#39;s start with my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, a mini intro to to Dropbox blogging. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/getting-started-with-scriptogram.html&quot;&gt;Like I&amp;#39;ve said before&lt;/a&gt;, Dropbox blogging is all about accumulating .md (Markdown) files in a Dropbox folder created by the respecting blogging platform. For instance, when I &amp;quot;installed&amp;quot; Scriptogram, the platform created a folder under &amp;quot;Apps&amp;quot; called &amp;quot;Scriptogram.&amp;quot; In it is every post I&amp;#39;ve created, all listed in posting order from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using Mou.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-10-Screen_Shot_2013-10-09_at_11.26.58.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2013-10-09 at 11.26.58.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m posting. First, get Mou, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/tools-we-use-mou-for-writing.html&quot;&gt;my new favorite Markdown editor&lt;/a&gt;. Under Actions -&amp;gt; Insert -&amp;gt; Scriptogram Header is a one-click meta data header that lists the date, the title and all the other details you&amp;#39;ll need. From there, all you have to do is hit File -&amp;gt; Post -&amp;gt; Scriptogram (it uses your Scriptogram ID, listed in the Scriptogram Settings) and you&amp;#39;re done. Couldn&amp;#39;t be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; If you edit a file and repost it from Mou, sometimes things get a little weird. I&amp;#39;ve found that the issues work themselves out after a few minutes, but for instant gratification, just go to your Scriptogram dashboard and hit Synchronize. Alternatively, if you turn on &amp;quot;Automatically publish from Dropbox&amp;quot; (directions below), edits automatically get made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The normal way.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Mou, the default way to post is to go to your Scriptogram dashboard, click Add Post, then start writing in the browser (or copy paste your Markdown). But to me, the best part of using a Dropbox blog platform is to completely do away with browser editing (not that there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with writing in the browser, I just prefer using apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-10-Screen_Shot_2013-10-09_at_11.29.42.png&quot; alt=&quot;Auto Scriptogram&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around the Dashboard, you first must go to Settings and turn on &amp;quot;Automatically publish from Dropbox&amp;quot; (still in beta). In the past, even if you added a file to Dropbox, you still had to go to the Scriptogram dashboard to hit Synchronize, but now that&amp;#39;s changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your favorite Markdown editor, just create your post, add the Date: and Title: meta information to the top and save it to your Dropbox folder. Without the meta data, things get a little wonky, but when it&amp;#39;s done right it works like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Read all of #iwantmyblog&amp;#39;s week with Scriptogram:&lt;/h3&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t Get Scammed By Domain Registry Of America</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve recently received a domain renewal notice from Domain Registry of America in the mail, please be aware that it&amp;#39;s a long-running scam. Domain Registry of America has been in a number of disputes over the past decade for sending what appears to be official renewal statements, but are really misleading mailers forcing responders to pay extremely high domain transfer and renewal fees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbb.org/upstate-new-york/business-reviews/internet-services/domain-registry-of-america-in-buffalo-ny-17000531/&quot;&gt;Better Business Bureau (BBB)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBB file contains a pattern of complaints from consumers who report that the company&amp;#39;s mailing is misleading. Consumers state that they have received notices from Domain Registry of America that appear to be invoices for renewal of their internet domain name. The company claims that their marketing materials clearly state that &amp;#39;Domain name holders are not obligated to renew their domain name with their current registrar or the Domain Registry of America.... This notice is not a bill.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Domain Registry of America currently has an F rating based on &amp;quot;252 complaints closed with BBB in (the) last 3 years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any such mailings, or any communication that seems suspicious or overly &amp;quot;phishy,&amp;quot; please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;contact our support team&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#39;ll verify its legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve talked a lot about Dropbox blogging recently at iwantmyname, so we&amp;#39;re starting iwantmyblog with one of the more well-known Dropbox-based blog platforms—Scriptogram. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptogr.am/about&quot;&gt;scriptogr.am&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Scriptogr.am is a tool for generating simple, elegant, static weblogs by reading Markdown files stored in your Dropbox folder. Writers are free to write with their preferred editor app, and publishing is as easy as hitting the &amp;quot;Synchronize&amp;quot; button in the Scriptogr.am dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-09-Screen_Shot_2013-10-08_at_11.09.06.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dropbox Signup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started is incredibly easy. First, you have to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox account&lt;/a&gt;—and the free plan is plenty large enough to get started. If you&amp;#39;ve never been exposed to Dropbox before, it&amp;#39;s a wonderfully simple hard drive in the cloud that acts like a local folder on your computer. But unlike your local folder, you can access your data from any device on the planet with an internet connection. For the sake of Dropbox blogging, a folder will be created in your Dropbox account that can be added to, moved or deleted without a hitch. It&amp;#39;s really quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-09-Screen_Shot_2013-10-07_at_09.26.00.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scriptogram Signup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptogr.am/&quot;&gt;Scriptogram&lt;/a&gt; and fill in all the necessary information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-09-Screen_Shot_2013-10-07_at_09.23.02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scriptogram Install&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, head to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; for a new domain name (you can also use one you already own) and install Scriptogram. Now you&amp;#39;re all setup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, the entire process took me about 15 minutes—much faster than the average site setup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Want to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/iwantmyblog-the-blog-that-goes-everywhere.html&quot;&gt;iwantmyblog&lt;/a&gt; in action? Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyblog.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyblog.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Read all of #iwantmyblog&amp;#39;s week with Scriptogram:&lt;/h3&gt;

				<title>iwantmyblog: The Blog That Goes Everywhere</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-05-iwantmyblog-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;iwantmyblog-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 2002, and I had a Xanga site. An angsty Xanga site where I talked about food and music and life and all the things a guy predisposed to have a Xanga site in 2002 were into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one day it dawned on me that the hit-counter adorning the bottom of my page actually wasn&amp;#39;t a cool feature. And that the &amp;quot;Currently Playing&amp;quot; widget attached to each of my posts didn&amp;#39;t even work half the time. Maybe if I found a new blog platform, I could take my soapbox to level 11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ordered a pizza, watched The Big Lebowski for the 50th time, waited 10 years, and here I am. Ready to find the next great blog platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The plan of action.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, a lot has happened in the blogging world. Templates got better. Responsive design became a thing. Social media went bananas. There&amp;#39;s quite a bit of catching up to do, and a ton of new blog platforms to try out. All said, it&amp;#39;s going to take an incredible amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to make it easier for myself, I&amp;#39;m giving each blog platform a solid week. With my trusty &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyblog.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyblog.com&lt;/a&gt; domain name in hand, I&amp;#39;ll work fast to build a basic site on Monday, spend the middle of the week writing about the platform and be out by the end of Friday. Then, with a clean URL and (hopefully) a mess of content in some sort of export file, I&amp;#39;ll take my blog on the road to the next platform. And so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Follow me.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re so inclined, come follow me on my little journey at iwantmyblog.com, or just keep reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;blog at iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; for all the bigger stories. And if you want to connect and talk about the platform I&amp;#39;m currently using (or the one I should use next), just send me an email at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;chris@ideegeo.com&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next stop:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptogr.am/&quot;&gt;Scriptogr.am&lt;/a&gt;, a Markdown-using, Dropbox-based blog platform with a surprisingly nice website.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Mou For Writing On The Web</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-03-Mou_Screenshot_1_402x.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mou&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is kind of a big deal these days in the web writing world, so naturally, Markdown editors are coming out in droves. Good ones, too. But the Markdown editor I find most appealing for my web copy wasn&amp;#39;t even designed for writers. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mouapp.com/&quot;&gt;Mou&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;the missing Markdown editor for web developers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about Mou is that it provides a live preview of my &amp;quot;code output&amp;quot; in a side-by-side screen display (full-screen writing is available, but I tend to be in the &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ok with distractions&amp;quot; camp). Markdown syntax is incredibly easy to write, but it&amp;#39;s always nice to know when I forget to end a link with a &amp;quot;]&amp;quot; or a start an H3 header with the right amount of &amp;quot;#&amp;quot;s. And it&amp;#39;s especially nice to be able to use Cmd-B for bold and Cmd-I for italics, although I&amp;#39;m sure this is a common feature amongst Markdown editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, with Mou you can post directly to your Scriptogr.am or Tumblr account with a single command. Very cool if you&amp;#39;re into &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/own-your-content-the-rise-of-dropbox-blogging.html&quot;&gt;Dropbox blogging&lt;/a&gt; and/or Tumblogging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re a developer, it does does so much more. &amp;quot;Syntax highlighting, sync scroll, auto save, powerful actions, auto pair, custom themes and CSS, HTML and PDF export, enhanced CJK support.&amp;quot; You can even write in Chinese traditional with a vertical layout. Pretty cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all though, you can get Mou right now for free at mouapp.com while it&amp;#39;s still in beta (although I wholeheartedly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://mouapp.com/donate/&quot;&gt;donating to the cause&lt;/a&gt;—I gave $10 last week). If you&amp;#39;re into writing in Markdown, give it a shot. I think you&amp;#39;ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A responsive, web-based alternative: Editorially&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#39;m also playing around with right now is a responsive, web-based Markdown editor called &lt;a href=&quot;http://editorially.com/&quot;&gt;Editorially&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/editorially/&quot;&gt;created by some really smart people&lt;/a&gt;. What makes it especially nifty is that it saves each version of your draft for all eternity (and displays them on a simple timeline), then lets you invite others to edit, leave comments and discuss your progress. For long-form copywriters, these collaboration tools are invaluable—but my copy tends to be relatively short. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.MY New Malaysian Domain Extension</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-10-03-bigstock-KUALA-LUMPUR-MALAYSIA--AUGUS-42681250.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Malaysia&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home to more than 28 million people, Malaysia is a beautiful coastal country split into two parts by the South China Sea—Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. And amongst its endless white-sand beaches and prehistoric rain forests, there&amp;#39;s quite a bit going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World-class shopping in Kuala Lumpur (rated CNNGo&amp;#39;s fourth best shopping city on the planet). Delicious dining at George Town, Penang. Unbelievable sightseeing on Langkawi Island. And a number of must-see events and celebrations, including Thaipuasam at the Batu Caves, Hari Merdeka and the Formula One Malaysia Grand Prix in Sepang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you can own a small bit of Malaysia yourself with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/my-malaysian-domain-name-registration-for-malaysia&quot;&gt;.MY domain name&lt;/a&gt;, perfect for local businesses, organizations and anyone with a great .MY domain hack up their sleeves (wham.my, anyone?). Get yours today!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mad Mimi Means Happy Email Marketing</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the truth. Small businesses and entities around the world waste a gazillion dollars a year paying marketing firms to figure email marketing out for them. And sure, there are plenty of instances where having an email marketing team is useful, but for the vast majority of folks, a platform like &lt;a href=&quot;https://madmimi.com/&quot;&gt;Mad Mimi&lt;/a&gt; is all you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Mad Mimi, email marketing is about as simple as it can possibly get. Just start up an email, lay your content into modules and arrange your page to perfection. Instead of getting caught up in rigid themes which quickly become dated, you have full control over what goes where. Throw a banner on top (they&amp;#39;ll help you create one) and go full width, tweak a theme to look just how you want it or hire a freelance designer to make you a nice template. It&amp;#39;s all super fast and incredibly intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what makes Mad Mimi especially nice is its automated backend—which is robust enough to run a heavyweight campaign. Automatically manage bounces and unsubscribes. Real-time tracking and targeted reporting. SSL data protection. Integration with a huge selection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://madmimi.com/integrations&quot;&gt;third-party platforms&lt;/a&gt;, interactive lists and forms, and of course, brilliant custom domains (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/marketing/madmimi-newsletter-custom-domain&quot;&gt;one-click setup in our marketplace!&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And best of all, the Mad Mimi team is full of extremely pleasant people. So if you&amp;#39;re looking to start up an email campaign or simply want to test the waters of email marketing, Mad Mimi should definitely be on your radar.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>FastMail Buys Itself Back</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fastmail.fm/2013/09/25/exciting-news-fastmail-staff-purchase-the-business-from-opera/&quot;&gt;FastMail blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt; was bought by Opera Software. The developers and staff of FastMail have now bought back the company. This means that FastMail is once again an independent company, dedicated to building the best possible email experience for our users. We have big plans for the future, and we will continue to roll out new features and enhancements over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we definitely have a soft spot for independent companies, because nothing beats the innovative thinking and agility independence brings. So good luck to the team—we&amp;#39;re excited to see what the future brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s an extra little tidbit from the FastMail team, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell your friends that there&amp;#39;s a real alternative to the big corporations. One that doesn&amp;#39;t show ads, respects your privacy, and is fully committed to keeping the service going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>UX Design Day Student Surprise!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-09-26-uxdd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;uxdd&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are involved with product development, design or user experience in any way at all, then you will love &lt;a href=&quot;http://uxdesignday.org/wellington/&quot;&gt;UX Design Day&lt;/a&gt; which is coming to Wellington very soon. The local speaker line-up reads like a who&amp;#39;s who of our web design glitterati, including Philip Fierlinger (Xero), Ruth Brown (TradeMe) and the fabulous Philippa Dawe from design agency Alexander Rose. Keynoting is Wesley Yun, Samsung&amp;#39;s U.S. based creative director. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we are playing a part in improving design and usability in our little corner of the web world too, so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that we are looking forward to sending a big delegation along to this event. From gigantic &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain name search&lt;/a&gt; boxes to one-click DNS setup through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;apps marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re pushing hard to make choosing and registering a domain name easy and fun. But don&amp;#39;t take our word for it - check out what everyone else is saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;about iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think usability and good design are uber-important in business (and life generally). That&amp;#39;s a philosophy we&amp;#39;d like to cultivate in young people too. So we&amp;#39;ve got &lt;strong&gt;two student tickets to give away&lt;/strong&gt; for this amazing event. It&amp;#39;s really easy for students to enter. &lt;strong&gt;Just mention @iwantmynamenz and @uxdd &lt;u&gt;together&lt;/u&gt; in your Twitter feed before October 1st and tell us why you&amp;#39;d love a ticket to the event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Some New Additions To The App Marketplace</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we&amp;#39;re always looking to add great services to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;app marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. And in these past few months, we&amp;#39;ve made a bunch of additions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;enthuse.me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2013, and for many people in creative (and even non-creative) fields, showing off what you know with a traditional resume just doesn&amp;#39;t cut it. To get ahead, you need an online presence to show off all your best work and accomplishments. And that&amp;#39;s what enthuse.me sets out to do. Through an incredibly simple interface, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/enthuse-me-custom-domains&quot;&gt;enthuse.me&lt;/a&gt; lets you create a one-page profile of yourself, with handy tools for linking in your content from all around the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jumpstarter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about &amp;quot;coding with flow.&amp;quot; With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/jumpstarter-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Jumpstarter&lt;/a&gt;, all of your development environments, framework installs deployment and hosting are wrapped into a nice, tidy package. And with the ability to instantly clone/fork your entire application state, you can experiment and play with apps just like you can on GitHub today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;strikingly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re to the point know where even the least tech savvy of us are using high-end mobile devices. But when you look at the vast majority of sites on the web, mobile clearly takes a back seat. Well, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/strikingly-custom-domain&quot;&gt;strikingly&lt;/a&gt;, you can create a mobile-optimized &amp;quot;one-pager&amp;quot; in minutes—perfect for small businesses who have no (or a very outdated) web presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dunked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like enthuse.me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/dunked-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Dunked&lt;/a&gt; is a modern portfolio site built primarily for creative folks. But unlike enthuse.me, Dunked lets you build full-on, multipage portfolios. The basic package gives you 50 pages. 500 images. Full HTML and CSS editing. SEO optimization. And it&amp;#39;s all beautifully responsive, optimized for both standard mobile devices and modern Retina displays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Roon.io&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilitarians rejoice! &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/roon-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Roon&lt;/a&gt; is a blogging platform that takes all the BS out of the picture. No dealing with code, setup, social gimmicks or unnecessary blogging features. Just a simple, Markdown-based writing platform meant to give writers the means to write. Quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BitBalloon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you built a painfully simple static site, with no moving parts or complicated tidbits? Interested in &amp;quot;optimizing the hell out of it,&amp;quot; then deploying it with possibly the world&amp;#39;s easiest drag-and-drop deployment method—with working forms built with ordinary HTML? It sounds like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/bitballoon-custom-domain&quot;&gt;BitBalloon&lt;/a&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CloudCannon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a CMS is nice. But having a simple CMS that harnesses the power of Dropbox to deploy sites as fast as a cannon (sorry), is even better. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/cloud-cannon-custom-domains&quot;&gt;CloudCannon&lt;/a&gt;, you can &amp;quot;turn your HTML and CSS into a hosted CMS in seconds,&amp;quot; just by uploading your files to a Dropbox folder. Best of all, CloudCannon gives you unlimited storage and bandwidth, so growing your site will never be an issue. And did we mention it&amp;#39;s fast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mad Mimi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For being as mad as Mimi claims to be, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/marketing/madmimi-newsletter-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Mad Mimi&lt;/a&gt; really is a delightful email marketing company. And what makes them great is that they their service isn&amp;#39;t tied to a corporate agenda—it&amp;#39;s just a robust platform built to deliver better, more friendly emails that people might actually want to read. Now doesn&amp;#39;t that sound nice?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Marco Names His Podcast App</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/2013/09/24/naming-overcast&quot;&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;, creator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast.fm&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of @overcast on Twitter wasn&amp;#39;t interested in selling, and I couldn&amp;#39;t get it on Tumblr, Pinterest, or Facebook. So I registered @OvercastFM on Twitter, App.net, Tumblr, and Pinterest, and facebook.com/OvercastFM.2 I also took @overcast on App.net just in case, but I&amp;#39;m not going to use it unless I get the matching name everywhere else in the future — consistency between services is more important than having the best available name on just one or two of them.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t get the .com — its squatter wants $100,000,000 for it. That&amp;#39;s right, a hundred million dollars. I tried to get him to come down a bit, and he said he&amp;#39;d take $95 million. I offered him $1,000, which quickly ended negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it from one of the brightest minds in the tech sphere—when naming a product or service, brand consistency is key. And there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with not using a .com name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

				<title>How to get a custom email address</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one of the most common questions we get asked—&amp;quot;I just bought a domain name, so how do I get a custom email address?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, when you buy a domain through iwantmyname, creating a custom email address is just like creating a website. You have to pick a platform, then install your custom domain to it. For example, if &amp;quot;The Dude&amp;quot;—owner of theinternet.io (likely not the name of the real owner)—wanted to setup a custom email address, he could search through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;email hosts in our app marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and pick the one that suits him best. Each of them will let him email from thedude@theinternet.com, but each will also provide a slightly different set of features for a range of prices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do email hosting this way (through third-party sources) because we want to keep our focus solely on domain management. It&amp;#39;s our goal to be exceptionally good at what what we&amp;#39;re good at, so that means giving our customers the freedom to use whatever email hosting service that suits their needs best. So with that said, here&amp;#39;s a look at the six email hosts currently offered in our app marketplace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Free Email Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: For many users, Zoho Mail is a top choice because it&amp;#39;s easy to install, has a clean interface, delivers push mail and two-way sync, never displays ads and is free for up to 20 users (and only $2/user/month after that for a 10GB mailbox). But for users of Zoho Apps—including Zoho Writer, Zoho Calendar, Zoho Sheet and more—Zoho Mail is the missing piece for creating a full office suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Paid Email Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Google Apps is likely the most common email host people are using these days—and for good reason. With Google Apps, you get the exact same email interface and benefits you get with a personal gmail account, but with the added organizational benefits of Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Sites and more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, users could get a small-use Google Apps for Business account for free, but now they&amp;#39;re charging $5/user/month (or $50/user/year) after a free 30-day trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fastmail.fm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Created by Opera Software—the company behind the Opera browser—Fastmail.fm is a fast-growing email host known for reliability and security. For $39.95/year, you can get a personal mail account with 10GB email storage, IMAP/POP support and 2GB file storage for keeping your documents in the cloud (different rates apply for business accounts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/rackspace-apps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rackspace Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: While Rackspace Email doesn&amp;#39;t provide all the bells and whistles of a platform like Google Apps, it does have one very nice feature—hosted Microsoft Exchange. For non-Exchange users, Rackspace also provides a nice webmail platform, 24x7 support and multiple layers of spam and virus protection. Plans start at $2/user/month (with a minimum of five mailboxes), and increase as more features are added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Email Forwarding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pobox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Unlike providers like Zoho Mail and gmail, Pobox specializes in email forwarding. So instead of attaching your email address to a service with a webmail system you&amp;#39;re not used to, Pobox lets you forward your new unique email address to an email platform (and address) you commonly use. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side benefit, it also gives you the freedom to explore all the other great services on the market. From pobox.com:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your email provider introduces a new policy you dislike, you can move. If your ISP changes its name, your email address is unaffected. If a new service starts up that you&amp;#39;d love to try, you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices for Pobox services vary depending on the options you choose, but there is a 30 day trial available if you&amp;#39;re interested in trying out their email forwarding service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Other hosts?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your desired email hosting platform isn&amp;#39;t in our app marketplace (yet!), don&amp;#39;t fret—you can use any third-party email service by adding their respective MX records to your domain&amp;#39;s DNS manager. And if you need any help getting this set up, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;contact our support team&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Own Your Content: The Rise Of Dropbox Blogging</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-09-24-dropbox-logos_dropbox-logotype-blue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dropbox-logos_dropbox-logotype-blue.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something to be said for ownership. Owning your house. Owning your car. But what about your content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it—the average blogger isn&amp;#39;t interested in dealing with server space, the cPanel interface or ftp servers. They just want to blog without any of the hassle associated with backend development. And if current web trends are any indication, many bloggers are willing to pay a premium for things that simply work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms with blogging capabilities like Virb and Squarespace are making huge waves in the industry by providing simple setups and beautiful responsive templates. Even WordPress—which offers loads of great templates for blogging—is seeing a boom in great tech startups offing hosted solutions with guaranteed uptime and instant site and plugin updates. And lets not forget about the massive free platforms like Blogger and Tumblr that are offering free blogging with few strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when your content is tied to a specific blog platform, what happens to it if the platform seizes to exist? Will you have total control over it? Will you know how to export and reformat it to adhere to another platforms CMS standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter Dropbox.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of conversation, let&amp;#39;s say traditional blogging is like a checking account. Each bank or credit union has safeguards in place to keep your money liquid, but it&amp;#39;ll never be as readily accessible as if you just had a pile of cash in your closet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like that pile of cash, Dropbox-based blogging platforms give you on-demand access to every single post you create. Just write your copy, save it your site folder in your Dropbox account, then view it right there on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all, instead of being bound to a proprietary WYSIWYG editor (i.e. needing to login to a page to write and edit content), Dropbox blogging platforms let you use just about any plain-text word processor on the market. Mou. iA Writer. TextEdit. Anything. You&amp;#39;re in complete control of your writing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So where do we come in?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, our goal is to make installing a custom domain the easiest step in the site-creation process. And through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;apps and services marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, we offer easy domain installation to some of the best Dropbox powered blog platforms for writers, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/scriptogr.am-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Sctriptogr.am&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/calepin-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Calepin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using our domain dashboard, you can also use platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://skrivr.com/&quot;&gt;Scrivr&lt;/a&gt; which are not in our app marketplace by simply updating DNS records in accordance with the platform&amp;#39;s specifications (there&amp;#39;s typically an explanation of how to do this in the corresponding FAQ page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re a blogger looking for a simple solution to take control of your content, maybe it&amp;#39;s time to give a Dropbox-based platform a shot. Or better yet, with your files all available through your Dropbox account, you could try all the platforms out for a week or two without having to deal with content exporting or data incompatibility. When your content is truly yours, you have the freedom to do just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; And if you need even more reason to take control of your content, here&amp;#39;s a real-world horror story from .net magazine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lost 9,500 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/netmag&quot;&gt;@netmag&lt;/a&gt; articles are a strong reminder that nothing beats publishing your own content to your own blog on your own domain.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chris Shiflett (@shiflett) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shiflett/statuses/380729053353086976&quot;&gt;September 19, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>.COM.AR: A TLD Lionel Messi Would Be Proud Of</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-09-21-9570736163_5260fe59b0_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Argentina&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

				<title>I Want My gTLD</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are coming&lt;/a&gt;, and many of you are already showing interest by asking to be notified when certain extensions become available. So, like any interested party with a fascinating bit of data, we made a top ten list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went in expecting some of the seemingly obvious extensions to garner the most interest—gTLDs like .app, .blog and .news—but we certainly didn&amp;#39;t anticipate .church being the second most requested extension on the list. Or .music not making the list at all. It&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see the actual usage data once the gTLDs go live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will .kiwi will be world&amp;#39;s top selling gTLD? Will drinkers choose .wine over .vodka? Will mom bloggers far and wide change their domains to .mom? We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here&amp;#39;s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-church&quot;&gt;.church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-design&quot;&gt;.design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&quot;&gt;.blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-web&quot;&gt;.web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.nyc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-art&quot;&gt;.art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&quot;&gt;.kiwi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shop&quot;&gt;.shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Pagely Turns 4. Doesn&#39;t Ask For Any Gifts.</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-09-20-logo-blog-pagely.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-blog-pagely.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how great turning 4 was? No bills. Worries. Responsibilities. Just an unrelenting desire to build block towers and eat cookies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Pagely is turning 4 this month, and all it wants is for you to try their amazing hosted Wordpress hosting services for a month—for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s a birthday without gifts?  How about trying Pagely on us? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pagely.com/2013/09/pagely-turns-4-help-us-celebrate-30-day-try/&quot;&gt;Sign-Up now or anytime in the month of September and pay nothing for 30 days&lt;/a&gt;. In our history we rarely do promotional codes and even rarer has been any type of free trial.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It&#39;s Time To .CLaim A Chilean Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-09-19-4130990745_b3182f920a_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chile&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk a bit about Chile, home of our newest ccTLD, .CL. Hugging the western coast of South America, Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, known for towering mountains, stunning fjords and some of the best wine on the planet. (It&amp;#39;s also the fictional home of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Fring&quot;&gt;Gus Fring&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#39;m sure they don&amp;#39;t advertise it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cl-chilean-domain-name-registration-for-chile&quot;&gt;$79/annually&lt;/a&gt;, you can now claim your own small slice of this great nation--but let&amp;#39;s be .CLear, you&amp;#39;ll have to be .CLever to make your name special. Here are a few domain hacks already in use to help you get your mind going:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so.cl, un.cl, mus.cl, cir.cl, cubi.cl arti.cl, vehi.cl, chroni.cl, motorcy.cl, parti.cl, popsi.cl. (recepta.cl and recy.cl are currently open!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brilliant .CL domains are being scooped up fast, so pour yourself a tasty Malbec and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cl-chilean-domain-name-registration-for-chile&quot;&gt;register your Chilean name today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Know Your Domain Name Lingo</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;DNS. ccTLD. Domain hacks. If you&amp;#39;re just getting into the world of &amp;quot;domaining&amp;quot; or are simply confused as to what all the industry acronyms mean, DotSauce Magazine has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dotsauce.com/domaining-cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;simple guide to help you out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of acronyms, have you seen the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;list of new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; that will be released this year and next? I definitely see .doctor in my future. Domain.doctor, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What If I Don&#39;t Want My (Domain) Name?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from a guy who wanted to change his name to Bowser (or Rambo) from ages 6 to 12, I fully understand how hard it is to nail down a domain name. Do you choose something descriptive? Something creative? Something that spells a word using a domain extension like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ch-swiss-domain-name-registration-for-switzerland&quot;&gt;.ch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.es&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/se-swedish-domain-name-registration-for-sweden&quot;&gt;.se&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you come up with, you&amp;#39;ll probably second guess yourself a number of times—which is no big deal before you buy the domain name. But once you make your purchase, the domain is yours for a full calendar year. See, once your domain is registered through the authoritative registry for your desired extension (like Verisign, which controls the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.net&lt;/a&gt; extensions), domain registrars like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; are not able to resell them back to the source. No take-backs, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do if you pick something you don&amp;#39;t like? Here are some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Learn to love it.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like my pre-teen self, I knew I was stuck with my name for the long haul. There were some rough times, but now I can safely say I&amp;#39;m happy with the name I was given. The accumulation of my actions over time have made my name into something I&amp;#39;m proud of. And once it sinks in, your domain name might be something you&amp;#39;re proud of, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you question your name, just think of all the hugely successful businesses out there with names that could&amp;#39;ve easily been second guessed. Apple. Yahoo! Twitter. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Save it for something else.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the problem with a name is that it&amp;#39;s just not right for what it&amp;#39;s being used for. But it&amp;#39;s still a good name—one you can easily use for your &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; big thing. So hold onto it for the year (or forever), you never know when opportunity will strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Buy a new one.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the trick to truly being happy is to be more like Prince. The musician. Instead of getting stuck with a silly conventional name, he just changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol. The &amp;quot;Love Symbol.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, your domain name is stuck in a slightly smaller box (no symbols... yet). But don&amp;#39;t let that get you down--there are millions of domain names available (like thisisthebestcompanynameever.com—available now until it&amp;#39;s gone), with more &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;unique domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; being added all the time. Just be sure to turn off the auto-renew on your old name so you won&amp;#39;t be stuck with it at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So get out there and find something you love. You deserve it. And because we&amp;#39;re nice, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;here&amp;#39;s a spectacular link&lt;/a&gt; to help you out with your search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A writer? Why does iwantmyname need a writer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, to write, of course! Chris Hall joins us to blog, grow our social presence, write web copy, think of big ideas and answer the occasional support question (the easy ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s also a big fan of coffee, fancy drinks, kitchen appliances, big buttons on the internet, retina displays and cold weather. You know, all the important stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to say hi? Just send him a message on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtaghall&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and he&amp;#39;ll probably write back. No promises though.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Startup Genesis: Musings Of A Non-Technical Founder</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest post from Oliver Townend writing about his experiences as a web company founder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of 2011 I had an idea for an on-line business that seemed to make perfect sense. It grew out of a situation I have been frustrated by repeatedly in my time as a building contractor. It made use of existing technology and it had a potential target market that grew every time I bothered to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited, finally I had an idea that worked. I brainstormed and refined and built on the basic concept to the point where I had (in my head) a hugely complicated product packed full of exciting features and backed up by some wildly optimistic financial predictions. There was one major problem however: I had no experience of start-ups and absolutely no idea how to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept itself is fine. In theory it works and there is a market for it. But if I couldn&amp;#39;t build the product then it would only ever be an unrealised opportunity and one day someone else would do it. I&amp;#39;d get grumpy and resent them for it. I needed help. The first step was to tell people about it. Not in a comprehensive market validation way (I didn&amp;#39;t read The Lean Startup till much later) but just to get different perspectives, discuss the concept and discover if there was merit in taking it further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got myself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessmentors.org.nz/&quot;&gt;business mentor&lt;/a&gt; and told them about it. I asked around and found a couple of lawyers willing to meet informally and talk through the legal implications. I rang everyone I could think of who could possibly use this product and told them what I was trying to do. Most people recommended someone else to talk to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback was fascinating. Ranging from &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Yes,
I want that, when can I have it?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;No, I see no benefit in that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; and most interestingly &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I
can&amp;#39;t talk to you about that, we&amp;#39;re trying to do the same thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. The positives maintained my enthusiasm. The negatives forced me to confront my deficiencies. The competitors proved that I wasn&amp;#39;t the only person working on this and I needed to get moving. The hardest conversations revealed previously hidden problems and opportunities that have contributed hugely to the refinement process. Every time I explain or defend my theories I get better at it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised several things very quickly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The product needed to be simplified dramatically. What I thought was the key feature had been tried before, was fundamentally flawed and nearly impossible to execute. Another feature I hadn&amp;#39;t given much thought to had much more promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) No-one I spoke to was going to blatantly steal my idea, especially the sort of busy, technical people who could if they wanted to. They have other things going on. I have a head start at working on figuring it out, the more I get done on my own the more likely it is that I&amp;#39;ll have something valuable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I had a lot of work to do and no time to do it, I was already running a business and had no spare time to spend working on the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) I needed to talk to a lot more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) I needed collaborators. Technical collaborators...more about this next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oliver Townend is a builder, a writer and a post-graduate student in the Master of Technology Enterprise programme at Victoria University of Wellington.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With our tech start-up scene &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccafannin/2013/08/19/feeling-the-startup-scene-shaking-in-wellington/&quot;&gt;making waves&lt;/a&gt; globally, it&amp;#39;s good business sense to participate and also a lot of fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupweekend.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekends&lt;/a&gt; have really taken off here in New Zealand and iwantmyname was one of the earliest backers, providing mentors, organisational support and cash sponsorship. Recently I enjoyed the amazing privilege of being a judge at a special &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;social enterprise themed Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; event in our home town Wellington. We think encouraging and educating young entrepreneurs is one of the most important planks towards building a stronger economy and a more participatory society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our city has a lively tech and start-up community networked by numerous meetups, user groups and world class tech conferences such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://optimalexperience.com/what-we-do/lean-ux/&quot;&gt;LeanUX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Drupal South&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstock.org.nz/14/&quot;&gt;Webstock&lt;/a&gt;. We sponsor the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/&quot;&gt;PHP User Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Users&lt;/a&gt; plus we are big fans and supporters of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/&quot;&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Founders&lt;/a&gt;. We also started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Growth Hacker Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, for tech founders interested in tools and tips for building a business online. The whole ecosystem here is fueled by good coffee and excellent local &lt;a href=&quot;http://garageproject.co.nz/&quot;&gt;craft beer&lt;/a&gt;, which helps lubricate most of the deal making and brainstorming done around town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are heading down to New Zealand for a conference or holiday, make sure you catch up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; at one of the many tech conferences or meetups on offer in our area.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Austria. Where Your Domain&#39;s .AT</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-08-03-austria.png&quot; alt=&quot;austria.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question. Which landlocked European nation was home to one of the greatest composers of all time and has borders with no fewer than eight other countries? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer. The Republic of Austria or Republik Österreich, as it is known by its 8.5 million German speaking inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austria has a fascinating and convoluted political history but emerged from the turbulence of the first half of the 20th Century as one of the wealthiest nations on the planet. This success has hinged not only upon enduring and stable democracy but also because of it&amp;#39;s highly strategic geographical position in relation to the powerhouse economies of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its rugged alpine backbone being a picturesque draw card for ski tourists, Austria manages to attract an astounding 21 million foreign visitors annually. But you do not have to travel all the way to Austria to have a presence there. .AT is the Austrian domain name and has lots of fans from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a clever .AT domain hack in mind or just want somewhere to lay your h.AT ? We&amp;#39;ve taken an ice axe to our .AT pricing this month with a fantabulous 48% discount on your .AT domain. Let iwantmyname make it easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria&quot;&gt;register and manage your .AT domain name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Best Hosting Services For Writers</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came across the following tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;http://marco.org&quot;&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt; today which serves as reminder that you should control your online identity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writers: You don’t need Medium. You can host your own blog on your own domain with lots of other tools and hosts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Be your own “platform”.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoarment/statuses/362613401861636098&quot;&gt;July 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, it has become popular amongst creative people and focuses on a collaborative writing experience with a very clean and simple user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Reitz, developer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, further elaborates on &lt;a href=&quot;http://kennethreitz.org/why-i-left-medium/&quot;&gt;why he switched from Medium back to self-hosted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t embed any content in a post. Not even that tweet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t track referrers to know where my readers are coming from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t search Twitter for my posts because of the massively shared domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t even use &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es&quot;&gt;gaug.es&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t pick my own URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything but keep writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission at iwantmyname is to make it as easy as possible to register and set up your own domain name. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;apps and services marketplace&lt;/a&gt; also lists lots of hosted apps for all types from individuals to businesses. We&amp;#39;ve handpicked a few of them that are especially suited for writers who want to have more control over their content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (simply use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html&quot;&gt;static site generator&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some of you might ask: but what about my content on closed platforms such as Tumblr or Squarespace? That&amp;#39;s a valid question but Tumblr&amp;#39;s acquisition by Yahoo! earlier this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/worried-about-your-tumblr-blog-after-the-acquisition-by-yahoo.html&quot;&gt;resulted in lots of import tools&lt;/a&gt; by other services and the internet community for example. Most of the mentioned companies also allow you to export your data at any time which you should look out for when evaluating your next home on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;registering your own domain&lt;/a&gt; or need a recommendation which service to choose, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Searching For The Perfect Startup Domain Name</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Guest Post by Oliver Townend &amp;mdash; working on his own tech startup:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of my startup journey has not been coming up with the idea, finding co-founders or testing the idea on end-users. The slowest and most frustrating part so far has been simply choosing a business name and subsequently a domain name that I&amp;#39;m prepared to stick with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partly this is due to the evolving nature of what the business is/will be. A larger part of it is purely my indecision and the feeling that getting the name wrong will ultimately be the difference between massive success and catastrophic failure. This will almost certainly not be the case. Plenty of businesses have turned obscure or peculiar domains into household names and others have failed in spite of excellent branding and domains that scream success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a name that not only relates well to the business concept but is memorable, snappy, fun (but not silly), serious (but not boring) and most of all available has become a farcically long process and I&amp;#39;m beginning to see why consultants are paid substantial amounts of money to do just that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look through my notebooks and iwantmyname dashboard reveals a bewildering history of domain options, each with its own merit, none considered ultimately good enough. They range from my early .co.nz versions (easily obtainable but not suitably international) to self explanatory, www.getitinwriting.com (too long, plus it has tit in it) to &amp;quot;Take a word and stick an animal on the end&amp;quot; a la SurveyMonkey and MailChimp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way I&amp;#39;ve tried anagram generators, backwards words, made up words and combination words. I&amp;#39;ve considered various suffixes, different languages and alternative spellings. I&amp;#39;ve asked my co-founders for ideas, my potential customers for feedback and my 6 year old niece for inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve become frustrated at people who register and hoard good domain names and realised my hypocrisy when I look at the domains I&amp;#39;ve registered and will probably never use. I&amp;#39;ve lamented the fact that all the good names are taken and 
then been reminded that while 252 million of them have gone, there are a hundred thousand or so new ones added every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m not giving up, and here are the best bits of advice I&amp;#39;ve been given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about it, concentrate on creating an awesome business, website or blog. If you are successful, your weird domain name might become your biggest asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People click on links more than they type in whole website addresses. If you build something worth finding, they&amp;#39;ll find you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your mind, make up a list of the potentials and get your colleagues and customers to rate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By all means be random and obscure, but consider pronunciation and make sure you&amp;#39;re not accidentally including foreign swear words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If in doubt, stick an animal on the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, have I settled on a domain for my amazing, game changing new online startup? Ask me next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-31-oliver-townend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Oliver Townend&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Writing App Byword Now Supports Direct Blog Publishing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-30-124075-1280-thumb-540x337-286.png&quot; alt=&quot;Byword 2.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful text editing app for Mac, iPhone and iPad that is designed to make writing more enjoyable and productive has received a pretty large update recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats right, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bywordapp.com/&quot;&gt;Byword 2.0&lt;/a&gt; has been released and it brings in tow a majorly awesome new feature. The ability to directly publish to blogs. With the click of a button (and a small, one time purchase in-app) you&amp;#39;ll be able to publish to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/blogger-blogspot-free-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/scriptogr.am-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Scriptogram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://evernote.com&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t heard of Byword, it&amp;#39;s easily the best writing application out there for those that live in the Apple ecosystem. It&amp;#39;s beautifully simplistic and uses Markdown to format your writing, a format which I&amp;#39;m already hopelessly addicted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does Byword let you publish directly to your blog, you can export the document into a PDF, RTF, HTML or LaTeX document easily. If you&amp;#39;re not using Byword already, it&amp;#39;s time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&amp;amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4&quot;&gt;jump onboard&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.INFO Domain Price Increase On September 1, 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-29-logo-dot-info-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;.INFO Domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .INFO domain manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://afilias.info&quot;&gt;Afilias&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that they will be increasing their annual registration fee for registrars on September 1, 2013. Unfortunately, we have to pass on this registry price change and our registration/renewal fee for .INFO domains will increase from $14.90/yr to $15.50/yr accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this is an increase in price by Afilias only. We will not be adding any additional margin on top of this price increase. We hope for your understanding in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re interested in purchasing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO web address&lt;/a&gt;, they are currently on sale for $12 USD so now&amp;#39;s a good time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;snap up your domain&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How To Track Customer Service Happiness</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We pride ourselves in excellent customer support and have recently started tracking people&amp;#39;s satisfaction with our email replies using a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://nicereply.com&quot;&gt;NiceReply&lt;/a&gt;. Implementing their service was as easy as creating an account and placing a link in the footer of every support answer. They&amp;#39;ve got integrations with popular help desks such as Desk.com or Zendesk which even allows you to link customer support feedback to each case and team member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four weeks of receiving votes, here&amp;#39;s the verdict from iwantmyname customers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-24-iwantmyname-customer-support.png&quot; alt=&quot;iwantmyname-customer-support.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This metric part of a public profile page (see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;iwantmyname results&lt;/a&gt;) where you can publish any comments left by your customers. If you don&amp;#39;t include &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;testimonials or reviews&lt;/a&gt; on your website, it&amp;#39;s an easy way to show prospects what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also great for your customer service team to keep morale up. We regularly share the feedback internally in our office chat room. And who wouldn&amp;#39;t love to hear comments like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;you guys rock. I&amp;#39;ve been a customer for less than 24 hours and already you&amp;#39;ve helped me a ton!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I wish more companies were as good as you guys are at quick helpful responses.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;great help as usual form a great company to work with&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;10 minute turnaround -- super impressive!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Well done. Thanks for the quick service, and the politeness was appreciated for a transfer out.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our customers for such kind words!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about how we use NiceReply, please feel free to leave a comment or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Timely Reminder: Domain Customise Your Calendar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-23-timely.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;timely.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been quite a year for the founders of Kiwi tech start-up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gettimely.com/&quot;&gt;Timely&lt;/a&gt;, a cloud hosted calendar and scheduling system for small business. They not only aced the BNZ Startup Alley at Webstock and received accolades from the media. They also secured a &amp;quot;timely&amp;quot; investment round from wily tech entrepreneur &lt;a href=&quot;http://rowansimpson.com/2013/06/21/timely/&quot;&gt;Rowan Simpson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timely got up and running last year using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/windows-azure-custom-domain-registration-setup&quot;&gt;Windows Azure&lt;/a&gt; hosting platform and hasn&amp;#39;t looked back since. Timely looks good and integrates nicely with Xero and Vend plus all your favourite Windows and Apple time management tools. The nifty app also posts event reminders and handles staff rostering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love supporting cool Kiwi start-ups, so we set up an integration of our own and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/business/timely&quot;&gt;added Timely&lt;/a&gt; to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;apps marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, iwantmyname makes it one-click easy to add the correct DNS records to your domain. Now find out how you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/business/timely&quot;&gt;domain customise your Timely&lt;/a&gt; set-up.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Express Your Interest In 100+ New Domain Extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-19-new-domain-extensions-2013.png&quot; alt=&quot;new-domain-extensions-2013.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 250 million domain names currently registered globally, you may be wondering just why there&amp;#39;s a need for more internet real estate in the form of newly announced top level domains (TLDs). But let&amp;#39;s put that number in perspective. There&amp;#39;s already around 2.4 billion internet users now and that number continues to expand rapidly. The cost for individual users to create a personal presence on the web is dropping all the time as the cost of hosting has become a commodity and the quality of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder&quot;&gt;online website builder services&lt;/a&gt; has improved markedly. So it&amp;#39;s a safe bet a lot more people out there will be needing a web address in the future. There&amp;#39;s still plenty of room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astonishingly, over 100 million of the currently existing domains sit within a single popular domain extension that we all know of as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s top dog amongst the twenty or so generic top level domains (gTLDs) that have been the mainstay of internet domain addressing for almost thirty years now. Rounding out the mix are more than 200 two letter country code domains (ccTLD). But the field is set to expand to cater for both organic growth and the needs of businesses that want their owned branded domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year internet governing body ICANN opened the door for new domain applications and received hundreds of responses. Many of these applicants such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&quot;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&quot;&gt;.BLOG&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&quot;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt; now have provisional approval, so the web landscape is now wide open for property development &amp;mdash; so to speak. We will let you know as more information comes to hand for each domain, so check out the new domains that interest you and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;sign up to express your interest today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to set up email forwarding on your own domain using Pobox and iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an email address to last me my whole life. It turns out this is actually cheap and easy to do. You don&amp;#39;t have to do anything technical or give up any convenience. In fact, I still send and receive all my email through Gmail. But if I ever want to leave Google, it&amp;#39;s going to be a hell of a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great write-up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://konklone.com/post/take-control-of-your-email-address&quot;&gt;how to set up email forwarding on your own domain&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding&quot;&gt;Pobox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; by Eric Mill.

				<title>Dot-IS domain names selling like red hot Atlantic lava!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-07-01-Iceland-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Iceland Flag&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sparsely populated European island nation of Iceland could become the powerhouse of Europe with an enormous recently completed hydro power project, abundant geothermal energy supplies and plans afoot to export electricity to Britain. Perched on the fiery mid-Atlantic volcanic ridge, Iceland also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&quot;&gt;one of the hottest domain names&lt;/a&gt; around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst .IS domains are popular amongst Icelandic businesses, there&amp;#39;s an increasing trend for dot-IS to show up in cute domain hacks. Perhaps the most well known would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://who.is&quot;&gt;who.is&lt;/a&gt; which queries public Whois databases that lists the names and contact details of domain name owners or administrators. Since there&amp;#39;s no restrictions on ownership, the .IS web address can be registered by anyone globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve decided to blow off some steam and set a blow torch on our .IS domain prices this month. At $89 we reckon .IS domain names they will be flowing thick and fast like red hot Atlantic lava. Don&amp;#39;t delay and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&quot;&gt;register your .IS domain today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Here are some more international top-level domains (TLDs) on sale this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia&quot;&gt;Dot asia, the TLD for Asia-Pacific&lt;/a&gt; -- $14.90 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;Dot info, your general-purpose web address&lt;/a&gt; -- $12.00 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&quot;&gt;Dot biz, for businesses worldwide&lt;/a&gt; -- $14.90 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us-american-domain-name-registration-for-usa&quot;&gt;Dot us, a .com  alternative for use in the US of A&lt;/a&gt; -- $14.90 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;Dot co, used by many emerging companies&lt;/a&gt; -- $15.50 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;Dot me, nothing is more personal&lt;/a&gt; -- $19.90 USD&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>4 new blogging platforms launched in 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Phew, we&amp;#39;re almost halfway through 2013 already and there&amp;#39;s already been a bunch of crazy stuff happening in the blogging world. Not only has &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/worried-about-your-tumblr-blog-after-the-acquisition-by-yahoo.html&quot;&gt;Yahoo! purchased Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, a bunch of new competitors have entered the ring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Posthaven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve written about Posthaven and their awesome promise of lifetime hosting before and we still love them. Posthaven rose from the ashes of Posterous to save blogs from the old platform that was sold but also accepts new blogs now and is still rolling out new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-27-posthaven-thumb-550x320-292.png&quot; alt=&quot;Posthaven&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a trustworthy platform that&amp;#39;s going to last for a long time, we recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/posthaven-custom-domain&quot;&gt;use these guys with your domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Postachio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want something stupidly simple? Meet Postach.io. It&amp;#39;s simple, it&amp;#39;s easy and it&amp;#39;s gorgeous. Even better? It just builds on top of your Evernote notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-27-Postachio-blog-Platform.png&quot; alt=&quot;Postachio&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is create a notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postachio&quot;&gt;add your domain name&lt;/a&gt;. Then tag the note in Evernote as &amp;quot;published&amp;quot; and they&amp;#39;ll be flicked onto your blog. The idea of a blog that you don&amp;#39;t have to host it yourself and you still own your data sounds awesome to us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Postagon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling all minimalists! This one&amp;#39;s for you! Postagon is a free blogging service that brags that they&amp;#39;re the choice for those who want to have a clean and simple platform. Simpler interfaces are gaining a lot of popularity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-27-postagon-thumb-550x302-290.png&quot; alt=&quot;Postagon&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.postagon.com/&quot;&gt;demo blog&lt;/a&gt; to be amazed; the way that it&amp;#39;s laid out and is simply &lt;em&gt;readable&lt;/em&gt; is awesome. Whilst the service has a quite limited feature set, simplicity can sometimes be a virtue: there&amp;#39;s no theming at all (to keep the experience clean), no plugins, widgets or tags and... no social boxes. It&amp;#39;s just &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postagon-custom-domain&quot;&gt;blogging on your own domain&lt;/a&gt;, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ghost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the biggest runaway successes on Kickstarter this year, Ghost is an up and coming sensation. Intended as &amp;quot;just a blogging platform&amp;quot; rather than Wordpress&amp;#39; &amp;quot;we do everything&amp;quot; strategy, Ghost hopes to take the blogging world by storm with beautiful design and simply interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-27-53cb7cffa27c89a43bc91b40f604f7e2_large-thumb-540x371-267.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ghost&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform promises to focus on content and making people _want _to use the writing platform. The Kickstarter asked for £25,000 to build it, but ended up with an incredible total of £196,362. It&amp;#39;s simple, it&amp;#39;s beautiful and like nothing else that&amp;#39;s available right now. Ghost is currently being built by the team that was successfully funded and should be available for use later on this year. Not only will it be free, it&amp;#39;ll be open source too and will be simple to port existing Wordpress themes to. Colour us excited!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.kiwi Domain Ready To Fly</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-15-logo_dotkiwi2.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo_dotkiwi2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a long time coming but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/01/dot-kiwi-domain-takes-flight.html&quot;&gt;dot Kiwi registry bid&lt;/a&gt; to launch the new .kiwi domain has been approved by internet regulatory body ICANN. The organisation opened the door for listings of new generic top level domains (gTLDs) in 2012 and almost 2000 applications were received. ICANN has been steadily working its way through the huge pile of submissions and recently gave the green light to .kiwi . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offshore based New Zealander and Dot Kiwi CEO Tim Johnson expects the new extension to open up the domain space in New Zealand and provide more choice for domain fans and businesses frustrated with other more traditional but somewhat congested domains. The new domain will be open to everyone globally, but the trust taking care of the new gTLD will be donating a portion of .kiwi sales revenue towards post quake rebuilding efforts in Christchurch. The New Zealand domain landscape could expand even further with a proposal now under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.domainpulse.com/2013/06/13/nz-second-level-registrations/&quot;&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt; regarding creating a .nz &amp;quot;second level&amp;quot; domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunrise period for the .kiwi domain could begin as early as September, meaning that businesses and individuals with protected brands will be eligible to reserve domains in accordance with ICANN procedure. Public registrations should be on offer a little later in the year. Of course it makes sense to register your .kiwi domain with iwantmyname New Zealand&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;coolest global domain registrar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dotkiwi&quot;&gt;express interest in registering your .kiwi domain name here&lt;/a&gt; and we will keep you informed directly as the domain rolls out.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Posthaven: A Second Look At The New Posterous</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/migrating-your-site-and-custom-domain-from-posterous-to-posthaven-made-easy.html&quot;&gt;few months back&lt;/a&gt; about Posterous closing down and the new service created by the original co-founders called &lt;a href=&quot;http://posthaven.com&quot;&gt;Posthaven&lt;/a&gt;, which was intended to save Posterous blogs forever. The company offers hosting for blogs for just $5 a month and says that they intend to keep it that way forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-07-medium_image-galleries-thumb-500x250-279.png&quot; alt=&quot;medium_image-galleries.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t entirely clear what the intentions for the future of Posthaven was, but the company has been adding a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.posthaven.com/posthaven-launches-fast-beautiful-image-galleries&quot;&gt;useful features over the last little while&lt;/a&gt;. This week, they added a new photo gallery function which offers beautiful, fast and responsive photo galleries. The company even claims they&amp;#39;re the &amp;quot;fastest photo galleries on the web&amp;quot; and are utilizing Amazon&amp;#39;s S3 storage to deliver the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has also added the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.posthaven.com/one-step-closer-to-posterous-parity-autopost-to-twitter-and-facebook&quot;&gt;post to social networks&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.posthaven.com/new-features-pages-links-and-menus&quot;&gt;create pages and menus&lt;/a&gt; as well as the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.posthaven.com/new-features-post-video-audio-and-documents&quot;&gt;embed audio, video and documents directly in posts&lt;/a&gt;. There are a ton more things they&amp;#39;ve been adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.posthaven.com/&quot;&gt;over on the blog&lt;/a&gt;, making the site more appealing by the minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a &lt;a href=&quot;https://posthaven.com/our_pledge&quot;&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt; like Posthaven&amp;#39;s, I&amp;#39;d feel comfortable moving in permanently. They&amp;#39;ve even got the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.posthaven.com/the-posterous-migration-guide&quot;&gt;blog importer&lt;/a&gt; around! We&amp;#39;re excited by the promise of a blog that&amp;#39;ll last forever and if that excites you too, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;easily register and set up domains for Posthaven with iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Rails Girls Rally</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-06-heroku-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;heroku-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been a lot of discussion recently about getting more young people interested in software development and in particular getting more women into the game. Whichever way you look at it, there&amp;#39;s no denying that the developer scene is predominantly a male one. Show up to any hackathon and 90% or more of the players will be guys. Boring!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s probably many social factors that have led to this dire state of affairs, but if we are to build a truly knowledge based economy, then it&amp;#39;s important women who are interested have the opportunity to participate in non-traditional roles in the technology sector. That&amp;#39;s why we are excited about &lt;a href=&quot;http://railsgirls.com/wellington&quot;&gt;Rails Girls Wellington&lt;/a&gt; who are providing a workshop this weekend to encourage women to join the engaging and rewarding world of code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session matches newbie Rails coders with highly experienced mentors and the particular focus involves creating a simple application and hosting it with Heroku. That&amp;#39;s a subject dear to our hearts because at iwantmyname we make it easy for developers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&quot;&gt;domain customise apps hosted on Heroku&lt;/a&gt; as well as a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/io-domains-now-more-awesome.html&quot;&gt;Google&amp;#39;s recent elevation of .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; to planetoid status, we thought it timely to offer a cool .IO domain name as a spot prize for the Rails Girls Weekend Workshop. Even with our current &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO domain special&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#39;s a tasty prize! What more could a Rails Girl want?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Google Abandons Open Standards For Chat</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Google was a proponent of open standards that anyone could tap into to integrate with their own products. Unfortunately, the company has been undoing some of this over the last year with the removal of various open standards they have previously supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/google-do-what-you-want-with-reader-but-dont-kill-caldav-7000012628/&quot;&gt;CalDAV&lt;/a&gt;, then dropping &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/01/googles-dropping-h264-from-chrome-a-step-backward-for-openness/&quot;&gt;H.264 from Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpcentral.com/google-drops-exchange-activesync-what-s-it-mean-windows-phone&quot;&gt;Microsoft&amp;#39;s EAS protocol&lt;/a&gt;. The latest casualty was XMPP, the open IM protocol (also known as Jabber). The company announced their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess&quot;&gt;new &amp;quot;Hangouts&amp;quot; IM service&lt;/a&gt; last week which effectively kills off the XMPP standard in favor off a new, closed-source internally built protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company claims that &amp;quot;the openness of [Google] Talk led to bad user experiences like spam attacks, and limited us in terms of supporting the various forms of communication that we&amp;#39;re now able to achieve with Hangouts.&amp;quot; The EFF disagrees and argues that this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging&quot;&gt;complete backslide from the openness the company previously stood for&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any users of XMPP clients such as Trillian or Pidgin won&amp;#39;t be able to communicate with Google users who have upgraded to Hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-06-logo-business-hosted_im.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hosted.im Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t look like the company is going to take the decision back, but luckily you&amp;#39;re able to use other services to continue using XMPP. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hosted.im/&quot;&gt;Hosted.im&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;strong&gt;Hosted&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nstant &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;essaging -- the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man&quot;&gt;.im domain extension&lt;/a&gt; is a great TLD for that) offers such a service allowing custom domains and email addresses; and since their offering is dedicated to chat they won&amp;#39;t be moving away from XMPP anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve just added a 1-click DNS setup option for Hosted.im, so head over to the iwantmyname marketplace and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/hosted.im-xmpp-custom-domain&quot;&gt;start using using XMPP on your own domain now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s Cool This Week In The Creative World Of Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-05-revival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;revival.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always fun flicking through new domains that have been registered and especially any cool creative websites or interesting initiatives online. Naturally we like to share the love around a bit, so here&amp;#39;s some great New Zealand sites that came to our attention recently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, Canterbury University started up a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://uc360.co.nz/&quot;&gt;video competition&lt;/a&gt; called UC360. Contestants are invited to submit a 360 degree panoramic video clip that is funny and reflects student life. UC360 is only open to University of Canterbury students, but the introductory video on the homepage is very clever and worth checking out just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/cargo-website-showcases-retro-revival.html&quot;&gt;raved about this site&lt;/a&gt; previously, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://revivalfurniture.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Revival Furniture&lt;/a&gt; are still going strong with their wonderful line of retro recycled furnishings. Imagine your favourite old comfy chair given a new lease of life with a woolly blankie upholstering. The site is also a good example of how to create a tasteful sales brochure using &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;Cargo Collective as your hosted website builder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Fortune and Lee Bennett could best be described as leading &amp;quot;movers and makers&amp;quot; in co-creation and maker technology scene in New Zealand. Fortune co-founded the Makertorium showcase held at Te Papa and also set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://co-lab181.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Colab181&lt;/a&gt;, a maker space boasting it&amp;#39;s own laser printer. Bennett, who once constructed his own home-built aircraft, founded &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellingtonmakerspace.com/&quot;&gt;Wellington Makerspace&lt;/a&gt;, a well equipped project centre for creative and technically minded people. Both men see the provision of public education services as the way forward in attracting more people into the maker community. Wellington is also the home base for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ponoko.com/&quot;&gt;Ponoko&lt;/a&gt; a popular global web-based service that facilitates 3D manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a clever &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; for your creative, design or innovation project? Check out the many &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;hosted website builder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;creative portfolio&lt;/a&gt; offerings that we can easily customise with your own domain. We&amp;#39;ve also got a big &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;discount on .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; at present for that special web address.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Flickr Gets A Major Overhaul, Finally Looks Modern</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! had neglected Flickr essentially ever since they purchased the website back in 2005, but a few days ago they unveiled perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/50934634700/your-world-in-full-resolution&quot;&gt;the largest overhaul&lt;/a&gt; the photo sharing site has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only has the site been radically changed to make the most of the usable space on a screen, it&amp;#39;s also fully mobile compatible and now has proper mobile applications for Android and iPhone. Even better? The company is offering a terabyte of free storage to all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the changes, this means pro accounts have been discontinued. The only paid offerings now offer the option of doubling storage to two terabytes for $499.99 / yr or to remove advertising for $50 / yr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s definitely the best way to back up your photos for free we&amp;#39;ve ever seen, so we totally recommend jumping onboard and taking advantage of the space. If you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/open-source/&quot;&gt;Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt;, there are a bunch of great plugins for displaying your photos on the site too, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/flickr-photostream/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a great way to avoid having to host the photos yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flickr getting an overhaul like this is pretty surprising for a company like Yahoo! -- let&amp;#39;s hope this is the start of a new trend -- perhaps they&amp;#39;re on the track to becoming cool again? &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is DNS? Here&#39;s What You Need To Know: Part 2</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-06-04-logo-dns.png&quot; alt=&quot;DNS Records&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part in our article series about DNS basics. Check out last week&amp;#39;s article &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/what-is-dns-how-do-i-use-it-heres-what-you-need-to-know.html&quot;&gt;explaining the Domain Name System in general and nameservers&lt;/a&gt;. Today we will tell you more about the different DNS record types such as A, CNAME, MX and TXT records:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A record is the record that maps your domain name to a specific IP address on the internet. As an example you would configure an address, like iwantmyname.com to point to an IP address, e.g. 50.56.80.249.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAME Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a subdomain at another address, say mail.iwantmyname.com exists on another web server, like Gmail, this is where CNAME would be useful. It allows you to direct traffic that reaches that subdomain to a separate address. There are some other uses for this too, Google allows you to use it to verify you own a domain and reset your Gmail administrator password, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MX Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one&amp;#39;s easy: MX records tell people who try to send you email at your domain where your email service is hosted. The catch with MX records is that you should always set more than one to make sure that if one URL or server at your email host is unavailable you can still receive email. These are set using priority numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you to were use Google Apps for email for example, you would have a first MX record of ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM, with a value/priority of 1. Then, you would have a second record of ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM with a priority of 10. This tells potential email senders&amp;#39; servers that they should use the first record of ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM if it&amp;#39;s available, but if not, they can still send email to the same system at ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TXT Record&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of records are used for all sorts of things. For verifying domain ownership, combating spam (with SPF) and a few other usages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#39;t used to get to your website at all. For another example that uses Google Apps again, you would verify your domain by potentially placing a TXT value on your DNS of google-site-verification=rXOxyZounnZasA8Z7oaD3c14JdjS9aKSWvsR1EbUSIQ and this proves to Google that you indeed own the domain, since you were able to add the record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many services that you could use with your domain use TXT as a way to verify ownership, but SPF is another case where TXT records are used to help stop spammers from using pretending to be from your domain name. By setting a SPF record (using a DNS TXT entry), it helps other servers verify if mail from your domain is really from you or just being faked. You can read more about that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phew, still with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a overview of just some of the types of DNS entry. There are plenty more out there, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA_record#IPv6_in_the_Domain_Name_System&quot;&gt;AAAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record&quot;&gt;SRV&lt;/a&gt; records, but these are more advanced and you likely won&amp;#39;t need to know about these to get started. If you have any questions, sound off in the comments or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;send us an email&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#39;ll try to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.IO domains now even more awesome for startups!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-30-logo-dot-io-domain-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;.io domain logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news for .io domain lovers: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/io-domain-website-showcase.html&quot;&gt;popular domain for internet startups&lt;/a&gt; and personal sites is now seen as a generic country code top-level domain or short &amp;quot;gccTLD&amp;quot; by Google. This means you can target your site at a specific geographical audience such as the USA or UK in Google Webmaster Tools (&lt;a href=&quot;http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=1347922&quot;&gt;full list of generic country code extensions&lt;/a&gt;). We&amp;#39;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/dear-google-please-add-io-to-the-list-of-generic-domains-in-webmaster-tools.html&quot;&gt;advocating for this change&lt;/a&gt; since last year and are happy the search engine giant finally listened. Thank-you for that Google!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, the .io registry &lt;a href=&quot;http://nic.io&quot;&gt;Nic.io&lt;/a&gt; also switched to a different registry back-end allowing faster domain modifications and transfers between registrars. It is now using the standardized auth code procedure that you might know from .com, .net or .org domains already. Please note that this means .io domain transfers are no longer free of charge but will be extended for another year upon successful transfer without losing any previously paid term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As big fans of Nic.io we&amp;#39;d like to celebrate these awesome news with a special &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io domain sale&lt;/a&gt;. All new registrations are only $49.00 USD and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-registrar-transfer-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; only $35.00 USD throughout June. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;Happy domain hunting&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Protect Your Domains Using Two-Step Authentication</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to now offer two-step authentication for all iwantmyname accounts! This adds an extra layer of login protection for your account to prevent third parties from accessing domains and making unauthorized changes to settings such as nameservers or DNS records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to enable two-step authentication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor authentication is a free service for all iwantmyname customers and is provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://authy.com&quot;&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt; who offer mobile apps for iOS (iPhone) and Android devices to generate your personal security codes. If you enable 2-factor authentication, your iwantmyname dashboard is protected with this code, which needs to be entered in addition to your email address and password when logging in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-29-authy-iphone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Authy iPhone&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To activate the feature, please go to your account settings under &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/account/login&quot;&gt;Account &amp;gt; Login &amp;amp; Security&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and enter your phone number. Authy will then send you a text message to download their mobile application. Simply install the app, finish the Authy setup and you&amp;#39;re ready to go. Your domains are an important asset and we encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/account/login&quot;&gt;protect your domain registrar account with two-factor authentication today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Community Warms To Domain Registrar Upstart</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-29-warm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;warm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, with the colder weather driving people indoors, we had a few friends over for a quiet celebration...as you do. It&amp;#39;s been five years since we first formed the company and started writing code to develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;; so we really wanted to thank a bunch of people who had helped along the way with advice, support or the odd bit of work that kept us going as we built up the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many start-up companies fall by the wayside long before year five, so it&amp;#39;s a testament to a lot of hard work from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; plus the loyalty (and patience) of our foundation customers that has driven us forward thus far. Apart from creating new jobs and contributing to the economic recovery we always had a sense that we wanted to build a next generation &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; registrar that customers would love and that actually solved some real pain for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to be deeply engaged in our local community and give something back to the people that got behind us from the outset. We really love that we are in a position to do so and remain big fans and supporters of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend here in Wellington&lt;/a&gt; and all across New Zealand. We also help out with several tech meetups such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/&quot;&gt;PHP User Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/&quot;&gt;Growth Hacker Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/&quot;&gt;Wellington.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/&quot;&gt;Hackers and Founders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.pm.org/&quot;&gt;Perl Mongers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Unlimited Potential&lt;/a&gt;. As well, we&amp;#39;ve recently been involved with a number of initiatives promoting Wellington globally as a digital creative city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in touch with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname New Zealand blog&lt;/a&gt; or through the event listings in the New Zealand &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupdigest.com/&quot;&gt;Startup Digest&lt;/a&gt;. You never know where we might pop up. Keep Warm.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is DNS? Here&#39;s What You Need To Know: Part 1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-27-blog-dns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blog-dns.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re new to building your own website it can feel like there&amp;#39;s a bunch of things you need to know but you don&amp;#39;t really have an idea where to start looking. Luckily &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;we make setting up domains really easy&lt;/a&gt; for hosted services through our iwantmyname marketplace so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about technical details most of the time. If you are trying to delve a bit deeper into the technology involved there are so many acronyms and strange words that it can feel a bit overwhelming however. But don&amp;#39;t worry, we&amp;#39;re here to help clear the air a little and explain what each thing does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS technology touches your life in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-mockapetris/dns-what-celebrating-30-y_b_3211030.html&quot;&gt;many ways you probably don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/a&gt; every day. It stands for &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name System&lt;/strong&gt; which is the technology making it possible for you to type nice, human-friendly words into your address bar like &lt;em&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/em&gt; instead of computer readable IP addresses such as 50.56.80.249.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about DNS is that in this case, &lt;em&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/em&gt; and e.g. &lt;em&gt;50.56.80.249&lt;/em&gt; are the same thing. Try it out for yourself and put 50.56.80.249 into your address bar. It might give you a warning, but should still take you to our front page. DNS is simply that -- it allows computers to translate human readable things, like a URL, into an IP address. If you&amp;#39;re not clear on what an IP address is, think of it as a phone number in the phone book. It tells the potential caller where your phone is and how to call you. The phone book provides names so you know who you&amp;#39;re calling. DNS does the same thing. It provides a friendly, memorable name, which the DNS associates with a website at the numbered address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re certainly glad this exists, otherwise it would be pretty hard for people to remember to visit us at 50.56.80.249, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A name server is a web server with DNS software installed. It&amp;#39;s where you manage all of your DNS records and set who your web/email host is. This is the part that allows you to determine who your visitors will be talking to when they ask for your website and where you&amp;#39;ll be adding other records such as &amp;#39;A&amp;#39; records and &amp;#39;MX&amp;#39; records later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your domain is registered with us, we automatically set the nameservers to ns1.iwantmyname.net, ns2.iwantmyname.net, ns3.iwantmyname.net and ns4.iwantmyname.net for example. This would mean you&amp;#39;re able to manage the remainder of your DNS records using our dashboard and still &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;host your actual website elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. The only catch with DNS is that when you make a change to the name servers it may take a few hours before you can see the changes. This is called DNS propagation and depends on the Internet Service Providers involved between your computer and the hosting company. So if you have made an update to your DNS records and you don&amp;#39;t see any effect immediately, all you have to do is wait a few hours until the changes have fully propagated throughout the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for the basics about DNS and nameservers. In our next article we will explain to you more about the different DNS record types such as A, CNAME, MX and TXT.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.ORG Domain Price Increase On July 1, 2013</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-24-logo-dot-org-domain-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-dot-org-domain-128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .ORG domain manager &lt;a href=&quot;http://pir.org&quot;&gt;Public Interest Registry&lt;/a&gt; (PIR) recently announced that they will be increasing their annual registration fee for registrars on July 1, 2013. Unfortunately, we have to pass on this registry price change and our registration/renewal fee for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.ORG domains&lt;/a&gt; will increase from $14.90/yr to $15.50/yr accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been our philosophy to reduce domain prices as we grow, wherever possible. We absorbed many increases in registry fees for gTLDs (generic top-level domains, e.g. .COM, .NET or .ORG) over the last few years. This is the first time in our company history that we are passing on a gTLD price increase imposed by the registry. We hope for your understanding in this matter. Rest assured that we aim to continue our mission to deliver outstanding customer service and building the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;best domain management service on the market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Worried About Your Tumblr Blog After The Acquisition By Yahoo!?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-22-tumblr-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tumblr acquired&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been all over the tech news as &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/its-official-yahoo-is-buying-tumblr-for-1-1b-promises-to-keep-it-independent/&quot;&gt;Yahoo! acquired Tumblr for a whopping $1.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; this week. Now the big question is will the internet &lt;del&gt;dinosaur&lt;/del&gt;giant keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an&quot;&gt;their promise not to screw it up&lt;/a&gt; and let the blogging service blossom as a standalone product or is it going to be neglected like so many other bought-out services after a while? How will Tumblr change when they are required to integrate more closely with other Yahoo! properties or ads will start popping up on your site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, you probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be worried. You can actually be relieved because Tumblr was reportedly running out of money pretty fast and Yahoo! has the financial means to continue operation. So as long as Tumblr works for you as a publishing tool keep on using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now would be a good time to check out some alternatives -- preferably with import functionality for your Tumblr posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  WordPress lets you &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.support.wordpress.com/import/import-from-tumblr/&quot;&gt;import Tumblr to WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpengine.com/2013/05/why-move-from-tumblr-to-wordpress-ownership-and-creative-control/&quot;&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Help to import &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/761100&quot;&gt;Tumblr posts to Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  New open-source blogging engine Ghost will be launching with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/posts/485933&quot;&gt;Tumblr importer&lt;/a&gt; (you should &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform&quot;&gt;support Ghost on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  For the geeks there&amp;#39;s a general &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skywrite/sky-tumblr-export&quot;&gt;Tumblr to Markdown exporter&lt;/a&gt; and static blog generator &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/&quot;&gt;Jekyll offers a Tumblr importer&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re sure there will be more services coming up with Tumblr importers in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also ask yourself the question wether you want to go with a closed platform like Tumblr again or use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/open-source/&quot;&gt;open-source alternative&lt;/a&gt; such as WordPress, Drupal or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/looking-past-wordpress-how-ghost-could-change-the-web.html&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to fully own your data. Also, make sure that you always use a custom domain name because &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html&quot;&gt;your username on any closed service doesn&amp;#39;t belong to you&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever you decide, the iwantmyname marketplace is always a good starting point to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;find a web publishing platform that fits you&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;happy to help with any questions&lt;/a&gt; you may have regarding domains too!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname does not register domains you have searched for on our site. EVER.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been flying a bit under the radar for a couple of years but as we grow (iwantmyname is now serving 40,000 customers!) it&amp;#39;s only natural that some of the domain industry myths such as front-running are thrown at us. In case you didn&amp;#39;t know, front-running is &amp;quot;the practice whereby a domain name registrar uses insider information to register domains for the purpose of re-selling them or earning revenue via ads placed on the domain&amp;#39;s landing page&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_front_running&quot;&gt;more on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-14-frontrunning-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Domain Search Front-Running&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-14-frontrunning-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;frontrunning-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me be absolutely clear. We don&amp;#39;t do such things! In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130826042820/http://inside.godaddy.com/front-running-debunking-myth&quot;&gt;GoDaddy debunked the myths around front-running&lt;/a&gt; based on some search logs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unique as customers believe their domain name ideas are, there&amp;#39;s more &amp;quot;innovation collision&amp;quot; than many people realize. With so many domain name registrations happening every day, there is a good probability a domain name you searched for is also being searched by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even go a step further at iwantmyname and don&amp;#39;t participate in any aftermarket practices at all. Questionable activities of other service providers such as parking unused domains or upselling a wheelchair to your grandma to squeeze the last bit of revenue out of customers is the very reason why we started our company a little more than 4 years ago. You can read more the domain management ethics we stand up for on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname we&amp;#39;ve been longtime fans and supporters of Startup Weekends in New Zealand. Last weekend&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://auckland.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; event was no exception and we were pleased to shout some drinks for thirsty punters who rocked up to the Viaduct Basin on Friday night ready to do battle. Lenz and Paul from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; also took time out to travel north and get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of other sponsor companies on board that help ensure Startup Weekends keep popping up like mushrooms. We&amp;#39;d like to make special mention of Microsoft NZ and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/&quot;&gt;BizSpark&lt;/a&gt; who have really got behind the start-up scene in New Zealand lately and are &lt;a href=&quot;http://auckland.startupweekend.org/2013/05/02/bizspark-auckland-startup-weekend/&quot;&gt;big supporters&lt;/a&gt; of Startup Weekend. Thiago Almeida (pictured) has been leading the charge by connecting with the tech community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, starter uppers have a diverse range of resources and useful low cost tools on offer such as Microsoft&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/windows-azure-websites-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Windows Azure Websites&lt;/a&gt; to get their start-up projects underway. Developers are certainly smart enough to know what the appropriate gear is for the kinds of projects that interest them, so recent hand-wringing about vendor lock-in seem a little overstated. Like the domain registrar industry, there&amp;#39;s no shortage of competition out there. The bottom line is service quality and stability plus capability to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.arrivesupplied.com/&quot;&gt;Arrive Supplied&lt;/a&gt; who scooped the pool this time around with their bespoke care package service for travellers. Big thanks also to the Auckland Startup Weekend organisers for making it all happen. Need a cool new domain name for your web start-up? Choose from our selection of over 100 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; extensions and launch yourself onto the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft NZ are running a special &lt;a href=&quot;https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032552664&amp;amp;culture=en-NZ&quot;&gt;Startup Day&lt;/a&gt; on May 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Unbounce Custom Domain Setup Made Easy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-07-blog-unbounce.png&quot; alt=&quot;Unbounce logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news, everyone! We&amp;#39;ve got a great new service in the iwantmyname marketplace this week: &lt;a href=&quot;http://try.unbounce.com/with-iwantmyname/?utm_source=Partnerships&amp;amp;utm_medium=iwantmyname-Listing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=iwantmyname-Partnership&quot;&gt;Unbounce - the DIY landing page platform&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven&amp;#39;t heard of A/B testing, you probably don&amp;#39;t know who Unbounce are just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://try.unbounce.com/with-iwantmyname/?utm_source=Partnerships&amp;amp;utm_medium=iwantmyname-Listing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=iwantmyname-Partnership&quot;&gt;Unbounce&lt;/a&gt; allows companies to quickly create sets of custom landing pages for businesses that test how customers respond to a certain type of page or marketing campaign. Commonly referred to as &amp;quot;A/B testing,&amp;quot; the practice allows businesses to see if a particular marketing campaign, imagery or layout is more engaging for potential customers and tweak layouts on the fly to see how they respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, you&amp;#39;re able to use the iwantmyname marketplace to sign up with Unbounce and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/service/business/unbounce-custom-domain&quot;&gt;easily set up a custom domain for your landing page testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Looking Past WordPress: How Ghost Could Change The Web</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-06-53cb7cffa27c89a43bc91b40f604f7e2_large.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;53cb7cffa27c89a43bc91b40f604f7e2_large.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress has been around for so long that it&amp;#39;s hard to remember a time where it didn&amp;#39;t exist. Rightfully so, too, with the blogging platform &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wordpress.com/stats/&quot;&gt;running over 65 Million websites&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with WordPress is that it&amp;#39;s grown into a big, unwieldy platform that tries to do everything. In my opinion, it&amp;#39;s getting tired and a bit old and one can tell from the administration interface that it&amp;#39;s a bit dated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tryghost.com&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. An all new blogging platform that&amp;#39;s being built from the ground up for the modern web. The blogging platform -- which is currently only in prototype form -- is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform&quot;&gt;being Kickstarted&lt;/a&gt; right now. What&amp;#39;s amazing, is that the team behind the new platform had originally set out to get £25,000 to get started but has already blown away that goal (to the tune of £94,000 at time of writing) with 24 days still left to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to see why Ghost is gaining popularity so fast, though. It&amp;#39;s clean, designed with writing in mind, has a beautiful administration dashboard and is clearly designed for the modern web. Not only does it integrate with Facebook and Twitter, it&amp;#39;s fully optimized for search out of the box and is designed for mobile from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the biggest things about Ghost that&amp;#39;s helping gain traction is a partnership with WooThemes, which means the theme service will be creating themes for Ghost from the get go. Ghost is aiming for WordPress with their offerings too: it&amp;#39;s open source, but a hosted offering is available with exclusive functionality (such as automated backups) for a price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you back Ghost on Kickstarter, depending on how much you contribute, you&amp;#39;ll gain early access and will be able to start building later this year. If you&amp;#39;re as sold as we are, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform&quot;&gt;back the team behind Ghost now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Promoting Your Creative Portfolio With A Custom Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-05-06-22slides.png&quot; alt=&quot;22slides.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname we have a growing following amongst the creative community who love the idea of customising an online portfolio site with their chosen domain name. Once you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;purchase a domain&lt;/a&gt;, it is a simple step to select the required &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;hosted portfolio app&lt;/a&gt; and click to automagically add the correct DNS settings on the domain. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so much easier these days to get a collection of art, photography or design work posted online because of the many high quality hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;online portfolio services&lt;/a&gt; that are available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration&quot;&gt;22Slides&lt;/a&gt; is a new portfolio app that is getting a lot of attention lately. Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://anishbabuverghese.com/&quot;&gt;beautiful example&lt;/a&gt; 
of a 22Slides&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site that has been domain customised. The artist uses a 
dramatic photographic slideshow to draw in viewers and then subtly markets her 
global design consultancy offering with further examples of artwork and 
past commercial projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists and designers are attracting greater global interest in their work and securing actual paid contracts by exposing their creativity to a much wider audience. Promoting your art or design work online is a smart move for building reputation and customising your web address with a preferred domain name is the way to go for better visibility. It&amp;#39;s also easy to add other services such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;hosted email&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on the same domain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt; with a portfolio app and new domain name today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Going Across The Ditch: You Can Now Register .AU Domains at iwantmyname!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-04-29-blog-uluru.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Uluru&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being based in New Zealand, it was always on our roadmap to offer the top-level domain (TLD) of our Australian friends. We know that many of you have been waiting for this TLD since a very long time and it&amp;#39;s our absolute pleasure to finally be able to announce the addition of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.COM.AU&lt;/a&gt;, .&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;NET.AU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.ORG.AU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/id.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.ID.AU&lt;/a&gt; extensions to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that all .AU domains can only be registered for a minimum term of 2 years. You&amp;#39;ll also need one of the following identifiers for .COM.AU, .NET.AU and .ORG.AU domain names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australian Business Number (ABN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australian Company Number (ACN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Registration Number (RBN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trademark Number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New .AU domains are available at $24.90/yr ($19.90 for .ID.AU) &amp;mdash; that&amp;#39;s just a little over 2 bucks a month! We currently do not support .AU transfers to iwantmyname and hope to bring this functionality to you later this year. So in the meantime, throw some prawns on the barbie, grab a cold tinnie and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;celebrate with a new domain name for your online venture in Australia today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ANZAC Spirit Lives On With .AU Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-04-24-anzac.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;anzac.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand and Australia have a long tradition of mateship arising from a shared cultural context and solid friendships forged in the fields of past conflicts. Not only do we share a notable military history, but we also have close &lt;a href=&quot;http://geniusnet.blogtown.co.nz/2013/04/23/queensland-tech-scene/&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; and political links with our &amp;quot;cousins&amp;quot; across the Tasman Sea. So, after a long wait, it seems appropriate to be launching  some &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;Australian domain names&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyname.com.au/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; during ANZAC week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With well over 2 million .AU domains registered, the Aussie registry has seen phenomenal growth over the previous decade. But unlike most domains, registrants for these domains must provide documentary proof of a right to register. We&amp;#39;ve had to make a few changes to allow for this in our processes, but are very pleased to finally have some Aussie domains on our menu of over 100 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;global domains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage we are accepting &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;new registrations of .COM.AU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.NET.AU&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.ORG.AU&lt;/a&gt; . An Australian Business Number (ABN), Australian Company Number (ACN), Business Registration Number (ABRN) or trademark registration are all acceptable forms of documentation to accompany an Aussie domain registration. Personal domain &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/id.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia&quot;&gt;.ID.AU&lt;/a&gt; does not require any supporting business documentation. .AU domain names require a minimum two year registration period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have plans to implement .AU &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain name transfers&lt;/a&gt; in the future and we want to add Australian currency to our shopping cart very soon. So throw some prawns on the barbie, grab a cold tinnie and toast ANZAC friendship with a new domain name for your business in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Heads Up: Firefox 23 will block non-SSL content on SSL pages</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-04-14-logo-firefox.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-firefox.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web developers, it&amp;#39;s time to check your content! Mozilla &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Site_Compatibility_for_Firefox_23#Non-SSL_contents_on_SSL_pages_are_blocked_by_default&quot;&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Firefox 23, which is due for release into beta on May 17, 2013 is going to feature a change that blocks all content that is non-SSL on an SSL secured page.
Many websites still load elements in an insecure fashion even when their website is SSL secured, so this change is hopefully going to put a swift end to that. There is some disagreement over what developers should be using to solve the problem over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5514344&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, some argue for using &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/&quot;&gt;protocol-relative URL&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; in linking and others argue that linking should explicitly indicate the protocol.
Regardless of how you fix it, Firefox 23 will exit beta and hit the stable channel on August 6, 2013. It&amp;#39;s probably time to start planning for this now, not after it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Founders Humbled By Cambodia Visit</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Manu and Lenz from iwantmyname are just back from a head-spinning ten days in the tropical heat of Cambodia, participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gfnchallenge.org/&quot;&gt;Good For Nothing Challenge&lt;/a&gt; (GFN). Here&amp;#39;s a quick overview from Lenz about how the visit unfolded and what was achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mission was to support NGO and other social initiatives as the South-East Asian nation grapples with poverty and the need to improve literacy and numeracy amongst its young people. The trip certainly gave us a crash course on the current situation in the country. We learned about the various approaches being taken to
help improve the situation and the work that is done by both large NGOs and grassroots charities, of which there are over 3000. It soon became apparent that all NGOs are not equal and contributors need to be judicious about where they expend their time and resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, the idea behind GFN was to go to a country that faces massive challenges
and work with local NGOs and charities to make a change by applying our knowledge across the various fields of our expertise. During our lunch breaks we enjoyed local
speakers that told us about their experience in the aid sector and shared about their
lives in Cambodia, which really made a big difference in understanding
the environment we worked in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-04-11-gfn-cambodian-school.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cambodian School&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our first day saw us visiting a school next to an old rubbish dump in
one of the poorest slums in Phnom Penh. Grit, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gritlearning.com/what-is-grit.html&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; Manu and I worked on,
maintains a lab there. We gave out Android based tablets for school kids to use
in their time off to teach them maths. This lab gave us a good
way of testing progress, testing various interaction models and, most
important, working with the local teachers to increase the impact we can
have by helping them teach kids in a fun and easy way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grit lab is in a house that has no air conditioning, just one window and a
few fans. When the power goes out, which happens quite regularly, there
is no way at all of cooling down the room, which makes for quite a challenging
environment when the thermometer is nudging 40 degrees. I managed to
observe the kids in there for about an hour and after that my attention
rapidly faded. Picturing myself learning in there every day gave me a
very high incentive to focus my efforts for the remainder of the week. Our biggest challenge with the technology was overheating tablets. The games are not the issue, the CPUs are idling, it is dust and heat that
kills them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Developing an Android-based learning environment for tablets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With this in mind I started coding a working learning environment for
Grit that implemented the interaction designs we came up with after
watching the kids learn on the tablets. Manu worked on a curriculum and
on selecting content for the kids to play with that aligned with what they
were learning in class. Manu also made lots of progress on her Khmer language skills
because a lot of the maths they learn in the early years is in Khmer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because we lacked Khmer content for the tablets we instead worked closely with
the team that developed an Android learning course to foster a local
developer scene. It is hoped that this will give schools a way to teach Android development.
This team worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kapekh.org/&quot;&gt;KAPE&lt;/a&gt; and their schools to create a first
learning game in Khmer during the week. They also translated the entire
learning materials into Khmer which was so successful they have now been asked by universities if
they would be able to use the content as well to teach older students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We ended up with a working learning app that runs on Android tablets and
can expose any Android based game that is relevant for the age of the
kids playing. We also implemented quizzes that are in sync with the
curriculum and help us track progress as well as give feedback to the
teachers. Because helping kids is our main objective, we are developing
all the software via open source and everyone who wants to contribute can do
so on github. We plan to organise a few hack sessions in Wellington over
the next months and are looking forward to meeting many of you who want to
help out and hack on something meaningful locally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambodia is an incredibly diverse country. But their are huge inequities in wealth distribution, especially in
the capital Phnom Penh. It also has one of the highest density of
charities worldwide; which is a big issue because just giving money to
someone may only finance a brand new Range Rover &amp;mdash; and there are loads
of them everywhere. Being in Cambodia and doing due diligence who we
give money to and who we help by cutting some code, made me confident our
time here was well spent. It was also incredibly well organised and the
time we needed to hit the ground running was hours not days or weeks.
Working in Cambodia is very challenging but also very rewarding and I am
sure Cambodia will see us again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of the future of GFN, we are already talking about the next
event. No location and time yet but if you are interested in joining us,
please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; it will be a week well spent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GFN Cambodia was an amazing experience for both of us and permanently
changed the way we think about aid work and about education. We are
stoked that we built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;global tech company&lt;/a&gt; that in turn enables us to make a dent in the
international aid work with very targeted and well researched actions which genuinely target those most in need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>100+ beautifully designed .IO domain websites</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services&quot;&gt;showcase of well-designed websites&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io top-level domain&lt;/a&gt; from Russell Beattie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a list of the interesting io sites I found and passed the URLs through a free screenshot app called Paparazzi to create a bunch of thumbnails. I included them below so you could see for yourself what I&amp;#39;m talking about. Sure there are thousands of other sites out there, and plenty of .com&amp;#39;s, .me&amp;#39;s, .ly&amp;#39;s, etc., but have you have seen so many cool sites grouped together like that, all with such clean URLs before? Not a scammy site among them... it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing. Check them out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Simplified Custom Domain Setup For Windows Azure And Other Microsoft Apps</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re continuing on our mission to make configuring domains easier. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft category&lt;/a&gt; in the iwantmyname marketplace exemplifies this philosophy by offering simple configuration of the most popular Microsoft hosting services. If you&amp;#39;re looking to set up a domain with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-custom-domain-registration-setup&quot;&gt;Windows Azure Cloud Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-websites-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Windows Azure Websites&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/windows-live-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Windows Live (Outlook.com)&lt;/a&gt; you can now do it in just one click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-21-microsoft-cloud-services-banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft Cloud Services&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how it works for new domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a domain search for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-custom-domain-registration-setup&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-websites-custom-domain&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/windows-live-custom-domain&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchase the domain &amp;mdash; you can choose from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;100+ international extensions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the selected Microsoft hosting service after finishing your order and we&amp;#39;ll do our DNS magic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t used Outlook.com yet &amp;mdash; I&amp;#39;d encourage you to. It&amp;#39;s a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;free alternative to Gmail&lt;/a&gt; and offers a clean, new take on email while being just as powerful as other services that are out there. Also make sure to definitely check out Microsoft&amp;#39;s Windows Azure Websites offering which allows you to create a site with a few clicks using open source apps like WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, DotNetNuke or Umbraco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re ready to set up a Microsoft service, head over to the iwantmyname marketplace and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/microsoft&quot;&gt;customize your web address now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Inbox Pro: Revolutionizing Email?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re like almost everyone I know and are drowning in email, you probably realize that it&amp;#39;s a problem and there really isn&amp;#39;t a great solution for email overload out there yet. Gmail has released a handful of tools like priority inbox, but many of us still haven&amp;#39;t figured out a way to efficiently keep on top of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inbox Pro, an ambitious new startup has set out to solve that problem and help evolve email past a basic concept. No longer should it be just a messaging protocol, it should be able to assist us in actually dealing with information overload. Currently being kickstarted using a pledge based platform, the service that promises to solve our email woes is just 12 days and $29,000 out from being a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-19-inbox-pro.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inbox Pro Screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/voice/2013/02/08/inboxpro-com-structured-communications/&quot;&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt; calls Inbox Pro a &amp;quot;frighteningly ambitious&amp;quot; project and rightfully so. There are plenty of projects out there that plan to revolutionize email -- and have to some extent -- but none have caught on to the mainstream just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How Inbox Pro Works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Inbox Pro user is sent an email, the message will be placed in the users&amp;#39; queue and the sender will receive an automatic reply with a handful of options.The automatic response will give the sender an idea of how long on average the user is taking to reply and will likely bounce many senders at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, they are invited to &amp;quot;optimize&amp;quot; their email by following a link and categorizing it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes/No question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FYI Message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each type of message will show the sender the average response time and will obviously show that short answer questions are answered faster than long ones. Additionally, emails are able to be given an expiry time by the user so that they disappear into the &amp;#39;expired&amp;#39; box if they are not dealt with in time and the sender is notified of this case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty more brilliant features that the team plans to bring to Inbox Pro and you should read the post in full over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/voice/2013/02/08/inboxpro-com-structured-communications/&quot;&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re convinced, like us, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inbox-pro-a-revolution-in-email&quot;&gt;head to Indiegogo as soon as you can to donate&lt;/a&gt; (as well as supporting an awesome cause) and get a slice of the next email revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Migrating Your Site And Custom Domain From Posterous To Posthaven Made Easy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-14-logo-blog-posthaven.png&quot; alt=&quot;Posthaven logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no big surprise that blog hosting service (or whatever it was in the end) &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com&quot;&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt; will stop operating on April 30 after having been acquired by Twitter last year. Luckily, former Posterous co-founders Garry Tan and Brett Gibson have just launched a new venture to give your previous Posterous site a new home. It&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://posthaven.com&quot;&gt;Posthaven&lt;/a&gt; and plans to bring back the core functionality of Posterous which was posting to your blog by email or an online text editor without all the fluff. They also plan to charge for the service (we applaud them for that!) instead of taking the free route and trying to figure out how to make money later. You see how that turned out for Posterous...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to import your Posterous sites into Posthaven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until April 30th, you can download all of your Posterous sites including your photos, videos, and documents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com/#backup&quot;&gt;http://posterous.com/#backup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click to request a backup of your Space by clicking &amp;quot;Request Backup&amp;quot; next to your Space name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your backup is ready, you&amp;#39;ll receive an email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com/#backup&quot;&gt;http://posterous.com/#backup&lt;/a&gt; to download a .zip file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then log in at &lt;a href=&quot;http://posthaven.com&quot;&gt;Posthaven&lt;/a&gt; and import the file. Done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Changing the DNS from Posterous to Posthaven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you have a custom domain, the next step is to change the DNS records at your domain registrar. Log in to your domain management panel and look for the following A record:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;184.106.20.102&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Posterous site was set up on the naked domain and &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; subdomain, you have to change both values and replace them with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;54.235.156.25 (A record for the naked domain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posthaven.com (CNAME for the &amp;#39;www&amp;#39; subdomain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also find a detailed description in &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://posthaven.com/help/customdomain&quot;&gt;Posthaven&amp;#39;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For domains registered with iwantmyname, we offer all this as an easy 1-click service from the &amp;quot;Setup&amp;quot; tab in your personal dashboard. Simply select Posthaven from the app marketplace and you&amp;#39;re all done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have a custom domain yet? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/posthaven-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Buy a new domain for your Posthaven site now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.garrytan.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-14-garry-tan-posthaven-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example: Garry Tan&amp;#39;s Posthaven blog with custom domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10% off domain transfers from Posterous to iwantmyname&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now offer 10% off each .com / .net / .org &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain transfer&lt;/a&gt; for your domains previously registered through Posterous (i.e. their registrar partner eNom) until April 30, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if all of the above sounds really complicated to you, make sure to check out our managed transfer service. Simply mention the code &amp;quot;MOVETOPOSTHAVEN&amp;quot; in the comments section and we&amp;#39;ll take care of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;migrating your domain from Posterous to Posthaven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How To Easily Manage Multiple WordPress Installations</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-11-managewp-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;managewp-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re having &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; websites left, right and center, then you&amp;#39;re probably suffering from the same headache as most power users. Every time you log in to another site there&amp;#39;s something needing to be updated or maintained. It feels like you&amp;#39;re endlessly updating WordPress and while it&amp;#39;s not a bad thing to have updates, there&amp;#39;s a better way to do that. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://managewp.com/&quot;&gt;ManageWP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real solution to a WordPress administrator&amp;#39;s headache &amp;mdash; it allows you to manage as many WordPress websites as one can handle from a single dashboard. You can update all your blogs&amp;#39; plugins in one hit or take backups quick and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, ManageWP makes it simple to actually migrate WordPress to a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;web host&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone&amp;#39;s probably done this at least once if they own a WordPress blog and the migration path for WordPress is not the friendliest. ManageWP makes it dead simple &amp;mdash; you just add the old website in, then you set up a blank WordPress installation on the destination and use ManageWP to clone it. Nothing else required. The first time I did one of those migrations I thought it wouldn&amp;#39;t have covered off everything, but everything was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backups are another nightmare you face all the time &amp;mdash; ManageWP allows you to actually back up directly to third party services such as Dropbox, Amazon S3 and Google Drive. It zips up the entire website and drops it in there easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d encourage you to check this tool out when you get a chance, it can make your life easier and allows you to get on to the important stuff &amp;mdash; posting blogs! &lt;a href=&quot;https://managewp.com/&quot;&gt;ManageWP&lt;/a&gt; is free for up to five sites in the basic form but is just $0.80 per website, making it killer (especially if it saves you from a complete site failure).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting a new VPS? Do these steps first.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers&quot;&gt;great post by Bryan Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; on the things he spends the first five minutes doing on any new Linux server. We won&amp;#39;t copy the content, but in essence it&amp;#39;s a series of applications and tasks to run that allow you to be a safer system administrator.
We can&amp;#39;t recommend following these steps enough &amp;mdash; many first time VPS owners sign up for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&quot;&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; and do the bare minimum, leaving themselves wide open to compromise. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5316093&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; thread about the post also contains some interesting discussion about other steps that can be taken to secure a server and provide basic notifications. Particularly interesting was &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5316539&quot;&gt;the note about &lt;em&gt;etckeeper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; an application that commits changes to /etc/ to git, so that it&amp;#39;s virtually impossible to destroy your own server.
If you&amp;#39;re a bit more experienced, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicalops.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server.html&quot;&gt;ways to automate the&lt;/a&gt;tasks that are mentioned by Bryan so that it&amp;#39;s easier to install and configure the server from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Empowering People A Global Challenge</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time the domain name industry had an unfortunate reputation for being unnecessarily difficult to navigate; a reputation which discouraged internet literacy and hampered moves towards a better public understanding of the fundamental concept of a digital identity. Consequently, a few years ago we began developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; as a tool to overcome this problem and as a way to make creating and owning a digital identity as easy as clicking a few buttons. We also resolved to end ISP lock-­in by making it easy for everyone to set up email on a domain they have personal control over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Challenges while bootstrapping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping a technology company without any external funding places many constraints on both time and cashflow and until recently we had to satisfy ourselves with supporting local events and initiatives on a smaller scale with occasional beer and pizza. Having said that, many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/&quot;&gt;user groups&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org&quot;&gt;event organisers&lt;/a&gt; in Wellington and across New Zealand love us for it and we see it as an important contribution to our local community and a learning experience for ourselves too. Further afield, we supported many good causes globally with free domains and we are now finally in a position to contribute to other projects that have a positive influence on society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a movement called the &amp;quot;Good for Nothing Challenge&amp;quot; started recently in the UK as a way for (mainly IT folk) to contribute a weekend towards a charity to build stuff they need, such as websites and helpful productivity tools. In New Zealand the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gfnchallenge.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Good For Nothing Challenge&lt;/a&gt; took this idea a step further. We have wrangled some of our smartest star-t­up people and plan to fly to Cambodia for a week in order to help a number of charity organizations overcome hurdles with their infrastructure. We will help them to optimize work flows, build tools they need to operate efficiently and solve some basic issues they don&amp;#39;t have time or resources for currently. We plan to have an enduring influence on a handful of Cambodian charities and build a long term relationship with them to give them ongoing support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cambodia Shows True Grit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-06-grit-cambodia.png&quot; alt=&quot;grit-cambodia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia is a nation with a predominantly young population emerging bravely from a difficult history and now facing many developmental challenges. In April, Lenz and Manu from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; will fly to Cambodia and work on Grit, a program that gives tablets to kids in very poor areas to improve the quality of learning in an environment that currently has too few teachers and too large class sizes to efficiently teach young kids. We will work with the Kampuchean Action for Primary Education (KAPE) to help roll out Grit in a larger field trial and work on Grit itself to improve the quality of the application and align it with international education standards. We are excited to be in a position where we can begin supporting the GFN Challenge and other similar projects down the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to make a lasting impact and extend ourselves from, not only enabling the general public in the first world to owning their digital identities, but also giving tools to children in the third world that help them learn maths and English, allowing them to be less dependent on external help later in their lives. iwantmyname is all about enabling people, and we always want to push the boundaries of what that means to us. We are working on a way for our customers to contribute directly to our fund that goes towards projects like the GFN Challenge. Expect more reports from Cambodia and in the future from other similar projects that enable people.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Manu Makes Moving Domains Feel Like Magic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-05-blog-manu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blog-manu.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome Manuela Vetters to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname family&lt;/a&gt;! Manu joins us to help with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;managing your domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; and general support enquiries. She brings plenty of domain industry experience to the table, having worked for both the registrar and registry side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hired Manu because she&amp;#39;s got the patience of 100 Zen masters. As you can see, sometimes she can get very ...expressive... without her morning coffee though.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Prefer to own your data? Here are some alternatives to Google Analytics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web-analytics-software.findthebest.com/l/1/Google-Analytics&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; has become somewhat of the tool of choice for most people who run their own &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website&quot; title=&quot;Website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. After all, it&amp;#39;s free, and what&amp;#39;s better than free, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re always giving something in exchange for &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; offering a service for &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; and in this case, that&amp;#39;s data on your website. There are some great alternatives out there that many aren&amp;#39;t aware of so we&amp;#39;ve made a short roundup of the ones we liked most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getclicky.com&quot; title=&quot;Clicky Web Analytics&quot;&gt;Clicky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Clicky as Google Analytics&amp;#39; slightly worse looking cousin. It&amp;#39;s got a great set of tools that won&amp;#39;t leave you wanting alternatives and guarantees your data isn&amp;#39;t disappearing into somewhere to be used for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-05-analytics-clicky-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;analytics-clicky-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicky features real-time statistics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot; title=&quot;Twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; monitoring, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org&quot; title=&quot;WordPress&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; plugin as well as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes&quot; title=&quot;App Store (iOS)&quot;&gt;iPhone application&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s great at letting you dig into your data and show it in meaningful ways. Clicky is slightly faster to update than Google Analytics too, so it&amp;#39;s great for if you&amp;#39;ve got a large spike in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicky is a hosted solution, so has a few price tiers as well as a free version. It&amp;#39;s free for up to 3,000 payviews per day, and after that will cost to use. We&amp;#39;ve found that the Wordpress plugin for Clicky works much better than Google&amp;#39;s alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://clicky.com/&quot;&gt;Clicky&lt;/a&gt;, visit their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haveamint.com/&quot; title=&quot;Mint (software)&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a self-hosted Google Analytics solution and comes from the same developer as the very inspiring Google Reader alternative, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedafever.com/&quot;&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt;. Mint is all about &amp;quot;less is more&amp;quot; and offers very basic functionality but shows data in a very meaningful and easy to read way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-05-analytics-mint.png&quot; alt=&quot;analytics-mint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic functionality can be extended upon with their &amp;quot;Peppers&amp;quot; which are 3rd-party developed tools that extend the platform. Some may be turned off by the basic nature of the solution, as it only really shows you basic statistics and they can&amp;#39;t be sorted much further past that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mint is available for $30 USD a license which covers you for one website. It has real-time statistics and must be hosted by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other catch is, whilst it&amp;#39;s a great tool, there isn&amp;#39;t a free trial. You either jump in head-first or not at all. That said, many reports online say that Mint is a great tool. You can buy Mint from their website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haveamint.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://piwik.org&quot; title=&quot;Piwik&quot;&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did somebody say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Open_Source&quot; title=&quot;Open Source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;? We&amp;#39;re glad you did. There&amp;#39;s a few great open source tools too, such as Piwik, which lists itself as a direct competitor to Google Analytics and is totally free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-05-analytics-piwik.png&quot; alt=&quot;analytics-piwik.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piwik has been downloaded 1.2 million times, so it&amp;#39;s definitely popular for a reason. The product is stylish, self-hosted and highly customizable. There&amp;#39;s even a live demo &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.piwik.org/index.php?module=CoreHome&amp;amp;action=index&amp;amp;idSite=7&amp;amp;period=day&amp;amp;date=yesterday#module=Dashboard&amp;amp;action=embeddedIndex&amp;amp;idSite=7&amp;amp;period=day&amp;amp;date=yesterday&amp;amp;idDashboard=1&quot;&gt;available on their website&lt;/a&gt; so you can try it out before you actually go ahead and install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard is entirely customizable and allows for setting it up just how you like. To get Piwik, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://piwik.org/features/&quot;&gt;visit their website&lt;/a&gt; and download it. It&amp;#39;s free forever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Web Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**If you&amp;#39;re looking for something that&amp;#39;s extremely similar to Google Analytics in its ease of use and even design style, this is the one for you. You&amp;#39;ll feel right at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-05-analytics-open-web.png&quot; alt=&quot;analytics-open-web.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Web Analytics is an open-source self-hosted alternative to Google Analytics and is even able to run inside of Wordpress as a plugin, which makes it especially easy for those new to these kinds of services to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very feature rich, and offers a lot of ways to sort statistics that are gathered, just like Google Analytics. Open Web Analytics updates in real time, so you&amp;#39;ve always got the latest statistics. You can even use it to show heatmaps and mouse tracking to see how your users behave on your website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Web Analytics is completely free and can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openwebanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;their website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Extension Of The Month: .ES (Spain)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Spanish top-level domain (TLD) is a favourite amongst iwantmyname customers. With 1.5 million &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.ES domains&lt;/a&gt; registered in total, it is not only the preferred suffix in Spain but also internationally with many &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; floating around the interwebs (even the Spanish registry operator red.es is a domain hack &amp;mdash; redes translated means networks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-01-screenshot-domainr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot-domainr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example from &lt;a href=&quot;http://domai.nr&quot;&gt;domai.nr&lt;/a&gt;, a search tool for finding domain hacks in any TLD worldwide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing business in Europe, Spain&amp;#39;s domain extension should also be part of your wider brand protection strategy. Unlike other &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/02/need-to-register-domains-requiring-a-postal-address-in-europe-weve-got-you-covered.html&quot;&gt;European countries which require a local address&lt;/a&gt;, the .ES web address is completely unrestricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can register your .ES domain now for only $12.00 USD throughout March. And if you want to move domains from other registrars, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-domain-registrar-transfer-spain&quot;&gt;.ES transfers&lt;/a&gt; are even free of charge. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;Get started with your domain adventure today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Step Right Up Ladies And Gentlemen!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-01-registrator.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;registrator.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was inevitable that, with German co-founders on board, we&amp;#39;d be mentioned alongside colourful and jovial circus master Mr Dotcom at some point. Leading Austrian tech author and blogger Jakob Steinschaden visited recently and looked into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalsirocco.tumblr.com/post/44210163962/neuseeland-im-schatten-von-kim-dotcom-gedeiht-eine&quot;&gt;New Zealand start-up scene&lt;/a&gt; in the context of Mega. He uncovered a lively and well established tech start-up community with numerous other global success stories bubbling under the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That led to some interesting reflections around our office on what it really takes to build a global brand as well as a robust, scalable technology that delivers sustainable value to customers around the world. Performance art based marketing and bright shiny toys are great fun and can probably even get a business noticed, but it only takes you so far. A credible presence cannot be built entirely around a personality cult and very few of our start-ups even have the resources to burn on this approach. New Zealand based internet companies and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; builders need to be thinking global from day one and simply go out and create products that customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;love and respect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaging more deeply with entrepreneurs and thinkers from offshore and leveraging our natural environment to &lt;a href=&quot;http://geniusnet.blogtown.co.nz/2013/01/14/talent-attraction-narrative-needed/&quot;&gt;attract talent&lt;/a&gt; to New Zealand can therefore only be beneficial to our start-up scene and economy. We also need to educate and embolden our young entrepreneurs, which is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/02/creative-space-hosting-startup-weekend.html&quot;&gt;we support Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and other tech initiatives around New Zealand. Step right up ladies and gentlemen! &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;Transfer your domains&lt;/a&gt; to iwantmyname and help us invest in building a credible tech scene in New Zealand with big global aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname now supports DonationTo!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-02-28-logo-social-donationto.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-social-donationto.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re excited to announce the addition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donationto.com&quot;&gt;DonationTo&lt;/a&gt; to the iwantmyname hosted services marketplace!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DonationTo is a great, simple way to accept donations online towards your cause. It&amp;#39;s as simple as setting up a page explaining why you need donations and then sharing it with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they choose to donate, they&amp;#39;re able to choose from rewards for donating. Think of it as the Kickstarter for good causes! The platform has previously been used for all sorts of fundraisers, such as assisting children with cancer, funding healing processes for people involved in car accidents and helping out those affected by natural disasters, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donationto.com/blog/fundraising-ideas-help-with-natural-disaster/&quot;&gt;Nakhon Sawan Flood&lt;/a&gt; in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the iwantmyname marketplace, it&amp;#39;s as simple as buying a domain, heading to the setup tab of your account and choosing DomainTo from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;list of services&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the magic is done by us, and you don&amp;#39;t need to know HTML or DNS to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve got a great cause you want to contribute to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/register-domain-donationto&quot;&gt;make sure to try out DonationTo today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome to the iwantmyname team, Kevin Ingersoll</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-02-16-kevin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kevin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As you can see, Kevin is enjoying the beaches in New Zealand)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;domain family&lt;/a&gt; constantly growing, but also the iwantmyname family. We&amp;#39;re happy to announce the newest addition to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kingersoll&quot;&gt;Kevin Ingersoll&lt;/a&gt;, who is a self-proclaimed geek with dreads, domainer, EDM junkie, gamer, disc golfer, bowler, and aspiring DJ and cyclist. Whoa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s joining us as a front-end developer to help with the launch of our new dashboard (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/ideegeo.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dFNTLWlaZ0ZmTW1HYnZaVGZlZGpmYWc6MQ&quot;&gt;interested in early access?&lt;/a&gt;). Kevin will also make sure to improve our system for larger account holders so he can quickly transfer his 750 domains from other registrars to iwantmyname... ;)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Need To Register Domains Requiring A Postal Address In Europe? We&#39;ve Got You Covered!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-02-15-europe-flag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;europe-flag.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 20 years after founding the European Union, one would think that it may also have had a profound impact on the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) of its member states -- but the reality is looking somewhat different. In 2013 there are still quite a few restricted European top-level domains (TLDs) which require a local presence in the respective country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you can buy some of these TLDs without an address in Germany, France, Italy or other countries in Europe. If you purchase one of the following domain extensions at iwantmyname, we can help you out with a local proxy service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;: the French top-level domain requires a physical address in France which is added to all .fr domains purchased at iwantmyname automatically and included in our yearly registration fee. This also applies to the affiliated .re, .pm, .tf, .wf and .yt suffixes of French dependencies or overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;: our trustee service for .DE domains is available at $5/year and will be added to your order if required. It will replace your international address with the mandatory German admin contact address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;: the Italian TLD needs a street address in one of the European member states. Our .it proxy service provides this address for domains ordered through our service at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;: all .EU domains must be registered using a residential address in one of its member states. Should you not reside in the European Union, we provide a trustee service at $12/year and apply it to your order automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we are making it dead-easy to register international domains for you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;Get started with your domain search now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Creative Space Hosting Startup Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-02-11-swwlg2013.png&quot; alt=&quot;swwlg2013.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; kicks off the 2013 round of New Zealand events at a fantastic venue in the newly opened &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/colleges/college-creative-arts/about/events/new-college-building-progress/new-college-of-creative-arts-building.cfm&quot;&gt;College of Creative Arts building&lt;/a&gt; on the Massey University campus. Of course iwantmyname is continuing to support Startup Weekend, as the initiative continues to grow in New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend&amp;#39;s event differs slightly in that it begins on Saturday evening 16th February, in order to dovetail nicely with world class design fest Webstock. So it will be our pleasure to shout a few drinks at the event launch as well as offer each team a free .com, .net, .org, or .nz &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; for their project if needed. Some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; will also be on hand to help out with mentoring throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; has a large following amongst the design community because we make it one-click easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;domain customise design blogs&lt;/a&gt; and portfolio sites when you choose a hosted service from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;app marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Appropriately, we are also sponsoring a design student to participate in Wellington Startup Weekend. Imagine adding a new start-up venture to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;design portfolio&lt;/a&gt; right at the start of the year! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; - We have a winner! Massey 4th year design student &lt;strong&gt;Victoria Kershaw&lt;/strong&gt; will be winging her way to Wellington Startup Weekend courtesy of iwantmyname. We think she will bring a fantastic set of skills to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Greece Is the Word &amp;mdash; .GR Rebuilds</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-02-09-Greece-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Greece-Flag-128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we welcome .GR as the first addition to our portfolio of domain extensions in 2013! The Greek top-level domain is the most popular choice in the South European country and also makes for neat domain hacks of words ending in &amp;#39;gr&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-greek-domain-name-registration-for-greece&quot;&gt;register .GR domains&lt;/a&gt; at an affordable $49.00/yr. However, please note that new .gr domains have a minimum registration period of 2 years. We also accept &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-domain-registrar-transfer-greece&quot;&gt;.gr domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; from other registrars to iwantmyname and they are completely free of charge too! There are no local restrictions meaning any individual, company or organization worldwide can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-greek-domain-name-registration-for-greece&quot;&gt;register Greece&amp;#39;s web address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cancel That Card Saves The Day</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-02-08-madness.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;madness.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodness knows why banks insist on printing lovely pictures on our credit cards, since our cards spend 99% of the time in the dark, wedged tightly inside our wallets. I guess it differentiates one credit card provider from another and it&amp;#39;s a bit of fun showing off picture cards to friends. What is not so fun however is the hangover from posting an image of your lovely credit card online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely nobody would be so foolish? But, it happens a lot more often than you may think. Some folks just cannot resist the temptation to share their latest pictorial acquisition with billions of other internet users. The implications are obvious. Sooner or later some clever little fellow is going to get his grubby hands on your personal billing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s only one answer to this problem - &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancelthat.cc/&quot;&gt;cancel that card&lt;/a&gt; with their cleverly named domain cancelthat.cc! It&amp;#39;s a website that reminds us of the dangers involved in exposing your credit card details anywhere. Even better, there&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cancelthatcard&quot;&gt;Twitter bot&lt;/a&gt; that detects newly published card images and tweets a warning to the user. We think that&amp;#39;s a pretty cool idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a company dealing with thousands of credit card transactions each month, we are very mindful of the dangers and heartily endorse more education about keeping credit card information secure. So we sponsored a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; for the site as part of our support for initiatives within the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internet Founder Values Openness</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There was no mistaking the focus for Sir Tim Berners-Lee when he spoke to a packed house of over 300 at Te Papa in Wellington this week. As one of the leading developers of software that launched the Internet, he is perhaps the strongest and most high profile advocate for openness and inter-operability across the worldwide web that he and other researchers created. It was an opportunity not to be missed by the&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt; iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physicist and computer scientist has a particular interest in the application of open data after being prevailed upon by the British Prime Minister of the day Gordon Brown to take charge of releasing government data into the wild in order to create economic value and social advances. The U.K. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theodi.org/&quot;&gt;Open Data Institute&lt;/a&gt; promotes and manages use of open data from government sources and assists entrepreneurs to develop related business projects. That led to other initiatives around the world including our own &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;data.govt.nz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s fair to say Berners-Lee was largely preaching to the converted, the gathering was literally a &amp;quot;who&amp;#39;s who&amp;quot; of almost anyone influential involved in the web technology industry in the Capital. Thanks heaps to &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetnz.net.nz/&quot;&gt;InternetNZ&lt;/a&gt; for helping coordinate Sir Tim&amp;#39;s visit to New Zealand and for providing a live feed so others could participate. We understand a &lt;a href=&quot;http://new.livestream.com/i-filmscience/tbl-internetnz&quot;&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt; of the talk will be made available shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is a New Zealand based global &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain name registrar&lt;/a&gt; that values and promotes a free and open internet for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pitfalls To Avoid When Transferring Your Domain From GoDaddy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We get our fair share of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; from the world&amp;#39;s largest registrar and while it is generally a smooth process, there are few things you should know before moving to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; (or any other registrar):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whois privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; You need to disable whois privacy through GoDaddy&amp;#39;s DomainsByProxy service. Otherwise they will allow you to start the transfer to another registrar but cancel it later in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recently updated owner:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have updated the owner details of a domain, GoDaddy will decline the transfer for 60 days. You can send an email to &lt;em&gt;review60 [at] godaddy.com&lt;/em&gt; and they will work with you to make the domain transferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorrect authorization codes:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you request an authorization code through GoDaddy&amp;#39;s control panel for some country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), they will send you an invalid code by email. This applies to .de, .ms, .fm, .nz and some other domain extensions. We recommend to contact them by phone and specifically ask for an auth code from their ccTLD team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;ccTLDs needing local presence: *&lt;/em&gt;GoDaddy might also decline a transfer if you use a proxy service, e.g. a German address for .de domains. In that case, we are able to provide you with details of our local presence service so they can update the domain accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds at all complicated or you run into any problems, we are more than happy to help in migrating your domains with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;managed domain transfer service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Summer Full Of Tech</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.summeroftech.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Summer of Tech&lt;/a&gt; is a great initiative that matches tertiary students with intern positions in the technology sector. &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Unlimited Potential&lt;/a&gt; is Wellington&amp;#39;s largest community of information technology professionals offering engaging networking events promoting knowledge sharing, innovation and entrepreneurship. Those are just the kind of projects we love getting involved with, so we were over the moon when UP and SoT got together to run a &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/events/summer_of_tech_panel_agm&quot;&gt;tech panel session&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interactive panel discussion looking at technology and society, with some high profile players from our industry venturing forth with a few opinions about where technology is taking us in the future. Cloud computing, robotics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, virtual wallets, internet freedom...you can be assured of some lively debate. Of course there will also be beer and pizza to round off the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our support for tech events in the community, we are also sponsoring &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt;. We make it easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;domain customise artist and designer web portfolios&lt;/a&gt; and have an enthusiastic following amongst designers globally. Consequently, we are keen to give something back by providing a free ticket for a design student to attend the event. If you are a designer currently enrolled at a tertiary institution and have not yet registered for Startup Weekend, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;contact iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>History App A Walk In The Park</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-01-09-napier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;napier.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawkes Bay resident Lynette Cheyne extended her love of the region&amp;#39;s rich history by developing a story telling app called &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.walkthehistory.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Walk The History&lt;/a&gt; to enliven historic walks. The app delivers compelling audio and graphical information via smartphone. We think that&amp;#39;s a great idea, so we&amp;#39;ve made Walk The History our site of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lyn began with three tours that illustrate the fascinating history around Hawkes Bay, including information about iconic architecture, the Napier earthquake and other historical points of interest. One of the target audiences are cruise ship passengers from huge vessels that make frequent visits to Napier port over summer. The company also has plans to develop content for historic walks in other regions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napier is sometimes called the &amp;quot;art deco capital of the world&amp;quot; because the town was entirely rebuilt in this unique style after the devastating earthquake of 1931. There is a hugely popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.artdeconapier.com/pages/geon-art-deco-weekend&quot;&gt;annual art deco celebration&lt;/a&gt; in the town which will be held on the weekend of February 14-17 this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a small business or product offering that you&amp;#39;d like to promote online? You can now create your own simple site using one of these popular and economical &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;website builders&lt;/a&gt;. Search for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt;, then use our easy one-click DNS setup service to domain customise your new site.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Happy Holidays</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been an amazingly full and challenging year for us here at iwantmyname as we continued to win over new fans with our no-nonsense approach to domain management. Elsewhere, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html&quot;&gt;Hobbits&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html&quot;&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/10/scared-bitless.html&quot;&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;, 2012 has been a rather eventful year globally as well. Now as the holiday season is almost upon us, you can rest easy in the full knowledge that we will still be on deck keeping 
a watchful eye on your domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year we launched a crisp &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html&quot;&gt;new design for iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; including improvements in search speed and functionality. 2012 was also the
 year in which we witnessed hundreds of aspiring domain applicants preparing bids for the release of new top level domains. Some of the applications had merit, whilst 
others were downright &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/more-new-domains-wtf.html&quot;&gt;domain crazy&lt;/a&gt;. We continue to monitor the process and will keep you informed if and when new domain spaces emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got major plans for 2013 ourselves too, including additional development work on our 
customer dashboard. We&amp;#39;re also doing our bit for the economic recovery by taking on more domain elves, plus we are planning a move to bigger and brighter premises as we continue our global growth. None
 of these things would have been possible without the support of our valued 
customers however. Apart from your domain business, we especially appreciate
 all of your &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;.
 We want to make registering and managing a domain name easy and fun, so
 it really helps us to improve when we hear about our customers&amp;#39; 
experiences.
Best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Stumped for gift ideas? Avoid shopping mall madness this season and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift&quot;&gt;register a gift domain name&lt;/a&gt; for friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Christmas Card</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-12-18-pohu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pohu.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html&quot;&gt;Hobbits&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html&quot;&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/10/scared-bitless.html&quot;&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;,
 it has been a very full and challenging year here at iwantmyname. Now 
with summer holidays approaching, rest assured that we&amp;#39;ll be around to keep 
an eye on your domains whilst you are at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we launched a fresh &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html&quot;&gt;new design for iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;
 encompassing improved search speed and functionality. 2012 was also the
 year in which we tracked hundreds of aspiring domain applicants as they
 prepared bids for launching new top level domains, some with merit and 
others downright &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/more-new-domains-wtf.html&quot;&gt;domain crazy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got big plans for 2013 as well, including more development on our customer interface. February in particular is shaping up as a huge month in tech here in the capital and we are looking forward to attending &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://multicoreworld.com/index.php/mw/mw12&quot;&gt;Multicore World &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstock.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Webstock&lt;/a&gt;. Of course we will continue our support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=&quot;http://meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/&quot;&gt;other meetups&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/&quot;&gt;community groups&lt;/a&gt;. We also plan to do our bit for the economy by taking on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/are-you-a-kick-ass-front-end-developer-join-us.html&quot;&gt;more staff&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and moving to bigger and brighter premises as we grow globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None
 of this would have been possible without the support of you our valued 
customers however. Apart from your domain business, we truly appreciated
 all of your &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;.
 We want to make registering and managing a domain name easy and fun, so
 it really helps us to improve when we hear about our customers&amp;#39;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best wishes for a safe and happy Christmas from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Iceland Haz Cheezburger?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not to sure if they do because both &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=cheezburger.is&amp;amp;hideUnavailable=false&quot;&gt;cheezburger.is&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=cheeseburger.is&amp;amp;hideUnavailable=false&quot;&gt;cheeseburger.is&lt;/a&gt; are still available for registration. There seems to be an Iceland Cheeseburger Pizza though?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-12-17-iceland-cheezburger.png&quot; alt=&quot;iceland-cheezburger.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now THAT sounds healthy! Anyway, as one of the most requested country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, it is with great pleasure to announce the addition of the Icelandic domain extension to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;TLD family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&quot;&gt;Iceland&amp;#39;s ccTLD&lt;/a&gt; can be registered at a yearly cost of $99 USD with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-domain-registrar-transfer-iceland&quot;&gt;.is domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; being free of charge. Please note that ISNIC, the Icelandic registry, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isnic.is/en/host/req&quot;&gt;special nameserver requirements&lt;/a&gt;. If you are planning to use different nameservers than our ns1/2/3/4.iwantmyname.net, please check with your nameserver or hosting provider first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the .is namespace is rather small (41361 domains as of today), many great domains or domain hacks are still available. Make yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift&quot;&gt;domain Christmas present&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&quot;&gt;get your Icelandic web address today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Birthday Bash Domain Price Slash</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-12-04-cake4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cake4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to believe that this week already marks the 4th birthday of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008 we blew a raspberry at the economic recession and launched the coolest and easiest to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;international domain registrar&lt;/a&gt; site on the planet. Judging by how fast we&amp;#39;ve grown globally, plus all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#39;ve received from customers, we must be heading in the right direction. It&amp;#39;s been a lot of hard work, but also a great deal of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this momentous occasion we&amp;#39;ve taken a break from slicing birthday cake and took a knife to some of our domain prices instead! We&amp;#39;ve permanently reduced the cost on all &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.com domains&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.net&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.org&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot;&gt;.name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.info domains&lt;/a&gt;. Previously $24.90, these are now flying out the door at only $19.90. No need to manage your domains with an ugly offshore based provider - iwantmyname offers more than 100 different species of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt; chilled on tap, right here in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign up or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer your domain name&lt;/a&gt; to start enjoying the simplicity of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;New Zealand domain registrar&lt;/a&gt; site. You not only get our famous personal customer service, but also New Zealand dollar denominated billing and a GST invoice for your records, each time you do business with us. You will also be supporting Kiwi built technology going global and bringing home the bacon by earning valuable, low carbon export dollars! That&amp;#39;s something we are very proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Celebrating Startups And Small Business Success</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-11-30-parrotdog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;parrotdog.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, we are huge supporters of start-ups and small business in New Zealand and we&amp;#39;ve also &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/09/starting-up-new-zealand.html&quot;&gt;backed Startup Weekends&lt;/a&gt; since they began. So we are really pleased to be continuing these associations further by supporting next week&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Lean-Startup-Wellington/events/90958952/&quot;&gt;Startup Party&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got over 100 thirsty guests attending Startup Party at Wellington co-working space &lt;a href=&quot;http://bizdojo.com/&quot;&gt;BizDojo&lt;/a&gt; so we decided to get behind a new local start-up business that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2012/03/bitches-and-birds-startup-craft-beermakers-have-fu&quot;&gt;revving up&lt;/a&gt; the Kiwi craft beer industry. We got in touch with the &amp;#39;three Matts&amp;#39; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://parrotdog.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Parrot Dog Brewery&lt;/a&gt; and asked them to rustle up an ice cold keg of Parrot Dog Brewery&amp;#39;s wonderful product. Across the road, BizDojo are busily preparing to host the event as part of their amazing ongoing support for start-ups, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/&quot;&gt;user groups&lt;/a&gt; and other business and tech related community initiatives. That&amp;#39;s what we love about Wellington - everything is so handy, with small businesses tending to help each other out when the need arises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html&quot;&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/a&gt; generating a huge amount of buzz around our film, games and animation sector, plus loads of small tech companies going global from the capital, there&amp;#39;s a fantastic start-up, technology and innovation scene that is bubbling up with success right now. We are so confident about the future, that we are even &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/jobs/front-end-developer-wellington&quot;&gt;employing more staff&lt;/a&gt; at iwantmyname. That&amp;#39;s why we will be celebrating at Startup Party. There will also be more information about &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend 2013&lt;/a&gt; plus some games and entertainment for laughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re looking forward to shouting some start-up brews and catching up with loads of people before Christmas madness sets in. In the meantime, why not check out all the handy domain customisable &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/business/&quot;&gt;hosted services for small business&lt;/a&gt; we recommend in our app marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>In The Domain of Middle Earth</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-11-26-orc3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;orc3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you will be aware that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; is based in New Zealand, which is the location for filming of both the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and now The Hobbit. In fact Oscar winning director Peter Jackson shot much of the movie footage on a huge sound stage just a few minutes drive from our office in downtown Wellington. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie maker also employs a large CGI and special effects team nearby who additionally delivered the amazing digital effects for other movies such as King Kong, Tintin and Avatar. We are incredibly fortunate to be immersed in such a creative environment focusing both artistic talent and high technology on delivering a world class product to millions of fans globally. Some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt;
 even had roles as extras during the making of The Hobbit and we have 
many friends employed in software development and tech support within 
the film industry. It&amp;#39;s within that context that we ourselves are driven to build and deliver the most innovative and cool domain registrar technology on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the worldwide premiere of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehobbit.com/&quot;&gt;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&lt;/a&gt; happening on our front doorstep this week, the city is buzzing with excitement and has transformed into &amp;quot;the middle of Middle Earth&amp;quot; as the stars arrive for their much anticipated walk down the red carpet. There&amp;#39;s also been some odd and fantastical characters spotted entertaining fans around town in the lead up to the big event. I even had a very close encounter myself with a rather hungry and scary looking Orc (see photo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can have your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;Middle Earth domain name&lt;/a&gt;? We offer .ME domains that double nicely as your Middle Earth address on the web. To celebrate Hobbit week, the Orcs have been busy chopping and slashing our domain prices. So we are offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;discounted .ME domains&lt;/a&gt; for only $14.90 until December 1st. If you are a Hobbit fan, get &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; all about it or set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;domain customized photo portfolio site&lt;/a&gt; in time for the movie launch.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Parking Domains Can Delay Website Discovery By Search Engines</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Matt Cutts&lt;/a&gt; explains why you shouldn&amp;#39;t park your domain right until the launch of your website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eF8i6rKojXQ&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more tips from us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using a registrar automatically connecting your domain to a parked page &amp;mdash; with or without ads &amp;mdash; disable the setting immediately (e.g. by removing the DNS records).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a simple publishing tool such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/site44-dropbox-hosting-on-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Site44&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; to quickly summarize what the website is about before launching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots of other &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/free-hosting&quot;&gt;free hosted services with custom domain option&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to announce your launch or build an audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>How To Make An Online Shop That Rocks</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-11-05-rock.png&quot; alt=&quot;rock.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower Hutt web designer and rock fan Dave Keyes recently decided to combine his passions by launching an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting/&quot;&gt;e-commerce website&lt;/a&gt; to distribute rock themed clothing and gifts. Part of the profits go to the Cancer Society of New Zealand, so we figured &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://thisisatribute.com/&quot;&gt;thisisatribute.com&lt;/a&gt; was the perfect candidate for our November website of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave recently became a Dad, so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that designer-wear for junior rockers are featured prominently on the site. We think the &amp;quot;Red Hot Chilli&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://thisisatribute.com/collections/baby-rock/products/rock-colours-baby-one-piece&quot;&gt;jump suits&lt;/a&gt; are cute as a button, so if you have fashionable friends with newborns, you should definitely point them in this direction. Prints, badges and tee shirts are also available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site was built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;hosted online shop builder Shopify&lt;/a&gt;. iwantmyname makes it easy to customise a Shopify web store front with your own domain. Setting up a simple online sales site is easy these days and a great, low cost way to test the market with a new product line. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Search for a custom domain&lt;/a&gt; from our selection of over 100 domains and start building your online shop today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before co-founding &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, I was employed as an aviation meteorologist, so the events of this week have been both fascinating and frightening as New York and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States endured a full frontal assault from Extra-Tropical Storm Sandy. Forecasts of the danger led to mass evacuations and shut-downs of key infrastructure such as airports, subway and power utilities. But how did Sandy get so damn big and is there a threat to Internet services and data security when disaster strikes in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandy began as a late season hurricane originating near the Bahamas. Although the tropical storm barely made it to category 2 strength as it scooted past Florida, subsequent interaction with mid-latitude upper level systems and cold air from the north increased her ferocity. Energized by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream that flow along the east coast, the region experiences one or two major storms each year. Sandy was one of the largest recorded Atlantic storms by surface area and has similarities to Hurricane Floyd that deluged the north-east with rain in 1999. Hurricane Andrew (1992) and Hurricane Katrina (2005) gained greater infamy for wind strength and the extent of devastation wrought in the south of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With climate change and the forecast increase in severity of storms, how robust is the Internet infrastructure that we rely upon daily? Preparedness and technical redundancy are issues that constantly prey upon the mind of operational teams at any fast growing Internet company and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; is no exception. Consequently, we have our front end servers parked in several geographically remote locations globally. We also secure customer, domain and DNS record data externally with independent partners in Europe that have their own highly robust system architectures. System failure at any single location would never result in an irrecoverable loss of customer data or degradation of the existing DNS service on your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service providers who support key elements of the global Internet infrastructure and domain name system also have multiple layers of redundancy in place. For example ICANN was quick to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2012/10/root-zone-ksk-vs-hurricane-sandy/&quot;&gt;allay fears&lt;/a&gt; regarding handling of DNSSEC management based in its Virginia data center. Most hosted services in the affected area &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cloudflare.com/what-happens-when-a-hurricane-hits-the-web&quot;&gt;coped well&lt;/a&gt; despite some challenges. But the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/10/amazon-web-services/&quot;&gt;reported outage&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/30/hurricane_sandy_blog_death/&quot;&gt;failures&lt;/a&gt; of some prominent blog sites suggests that the chief threat lies with individual &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;cloud based applications&lt;/a&gt; that may be a little over-reliant on a single server node. But losing access to your Pinterest or Instagram for a couple of hours is hardly a crisis in comparison to the severe trials being faced by residents of the North-East in the wake of the storm. Keep safe!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Just Can&#39;t Get Enough</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Frequently described as one of the most influential bands of their era, British synth-pop pioneers Depeche Mode are planning a world tour plus an album release in 2013. They are amongst many groups managing their online brand presence using various smart domain customized &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/music/&quot;&gt;hosted services for musicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we were thrilled when they &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/depechemode/status/261148840726507520&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; using a superbly crafted &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;short domain&lt;/a&gt; set up through iwantmyname to illuminate their new studio production video clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you watched the in-studio collage video shown at yesterday&amp;#39;s press conference in Paris? If you haven&amp;#39;t... &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/xqpKxMxh&quot;&gt;http://t.co/xqpKxMxh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Depeche Mode (@depechemode) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/depechemode/statuses/261148840726507520&quot;&gt;October 24, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With around 100 million album sales, Depeche Mode must surely be the most well known band on our &amp;#39;books&amp;#39;. As music fans ourselves, it&amp;#39;s hugely exciting to be involved &amp;mdash; albeit in a small way. Musicians, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;artists&lt;/a&gt; and writers &amp;#39;just can&amp;#39;t get enough&amp;#39; of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;hosted services&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to promoting their work online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a musical or creative event launch planned? Grab yourself a cool domain and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener&quot;&gt;customize your own url shortener&lt;/a&gt; to track clicks and make content sharing easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the full clip for all fellow music lovers:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Opinion: Scared Bitless</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-10-29-pumpkin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pumpkin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween&quot;&gt;origins&lt;/a&gt; of Halloween are a little obscure with explanations varying from harvest festivals to paying homage to the recently departed. The celebration has evolved considerably over the centuries however, as it spread from Europe across the Atlantic and further afield. Scary costumes and regalia are dusted off each year to ward off evil spirits and fairies whilst gifts of food or sweets are given to appease pranksters. It&amp;#39;s all harmless fun for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s going on in our government I.T. sector at present is way more scary than the scariest Halloween that you can ever imagine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicaddress.net/onpoint/msds-leaky-servers/&quot;&gt;Revelations&lt;/a&gt; that confidential internal files could be accessed through public kiosks at Work and Income New Zealand have caused embarrassment at the highest possible level within government. This hot on the heels of blatant impropriety around the manner in which Mr Dotcom was spied upon and arrested and a legion of ACC files and other documents from governmental agencies that ended up in the wrong hands - and that&amp;#39;s just the cases we know about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst these stuff-ups make great media fodder, they also portray a steady decline in central government&amp;#39;s ability to manage information, despite hundreds of millions of tax dollars that are spent on I.T. systems implementation and management every year. The most scary part of this train wreck is that, on the one hand permanent developer roles within the government sector have been reduced, whilst on the other hand offshore based multinationals continue to be awarded major government I.T. projects over smaller but equally competent local contenders. The crisis is more about culture, than it is about the actual technology however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we trudge towards a pan-government login protocol and greater provision of government services online, how far can we trust government agencies with our data? Rather than the government warehousing and controlling our personal data, perhaps citizens should manage their own case files, medical correspondence, legal notes and status updates in a neutral repository? Users then approve who is and who is not allowed to interact with it in the cloud. People of all ages and backgrounds have already embraced &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/social-network/&quot;&gt;hosted social media applications&lt;/a&gt; and have become very competent at using them in a similar fashion. It&amp;#39;s not a perfect model, but it&amp;#39;s a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a radical solution. But we&amp;#39;ve reached the point where traditional thinking is clearly not working very well. We need some new ideas. As a company that provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domains&lt;/a&gt; and DNS management (the basic building blocks of the Internet) we think there is huge potential for a citizen-centric approach to information and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;online personal profile&lt;/a&gt; management. Imagine owning yourname.me where only you control who has access to your personal data? Secure &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;your own .ME domain&lt;/a&gt; now and prepare for the revolution!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Thoughts On Reserving The Digital Future Of Your Child</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Alexander Taub in Forbes&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2012/10/25/the-mad-rush-to-reserve-your-childs-digital-future&quot;&gt;The Mad Rush To Reserve Your Child&amp;#39;s Digital Future&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been noticing a trend over the past few months. I have a lot of friends who are having their first child. Many of these friends, especially the ones who work in the technology space, are reserving and managing the handles, email addresses, and websites of their newborns. They believe that when their child comes of age, the good handles, email addresses, websites, and digital accounts will be much harder to come by. By 2025, Jonathan.Smith@gmail.com or @jonsmith equivalents will definitely not be available. You may have to settle for @jonsmith13 or Jsmith13@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to do this, start with the most platform-agnostic handle and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;register the domain name&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows what&amp;#39;s the next hot social network, microblogging service or email provider? Domains, on the other hand, have been around longer than Twitter, Facebook and Gmail combined and there&amp;#39;s a good chance they will survive any other form of online identity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Be Authentic With Your Online Presence</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure if I agree with the headline but TechCrunch&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/heres-to-the-death-of-personal-branding-on-the-internet/&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s To The Death Of Personal Branding On The Internet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; reminds us of an important theme when &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile&quot;&gt;building an online presence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks, you don&amp;#39;t need a &amp;quot;handle&amp;quot; on the web and a tagline to get noticed for the things you have to say or share. All you have to do is be consistently you, as difficult as that might be for you. Don&amp;#39;t let other people tell you what to be, how to act or what to share. Also, don&amp;#39;t be a purposeful contrarian to get attention either, unless that&amp;#39;s really how you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are like snowflakes, but by making yourself become a &amp;quot;brand,&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re turning yourself into a nondescript pile of dog poo. Don&amp;#39;t do it. You&amp;#39;re worth more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be you. Be real. Please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Channel Island Domains .JE And .GG Activated</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;#39;re happy to introduce two more European Top-Level Domains from the Channel Islands &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/je-channel-island-domain-name-registration-for-jersey&quot;&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gg-channel-island-domain-name-registration-for-guernsey&quot;&gt;Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;. In case you were wondering, the islands are located off the coast of Normandy in France. And look how beautiful it is there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/janicskovsky/7945455410/&quot; title=&quot;The Sinking Sun - Pleinmont, Guernsey by Janicskovsky, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-10-15-7945455410_406eb8db39.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Sinking Sun - Pleinmont, Guernsey&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Channel Island domain extensions &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.je&quot;&gt;first appeared on the web in 1996&lt;/a&gt; and were added together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man&quot;&gt;.IM (Isle Of Man)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-international-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island&quot;&gt;.AC (Ascension Island)&lt;/a&gt; by internet legend &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel&quot;&gt;Jon Postel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the .JE and .GG namespace is unrestricted and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;new domains are offered&lt;/a&gt; at a special introductory price of $119.00 USD -- a saving of 20%. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer them free of charge&lt;/a&gt; from another domain registrar to iwantmyname (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;let us know if you need any help with your transfers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;short domain geeks&lt;/a&gt;, the registry also allows two-letter domains. Here are some tiny domains that are still available at the time of writing... Happy registering!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Names Dominate Call To Action In Australian Football Grand Finals</title>
				<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The television commercials aired during the 2012 AFL and NRL Grand Finals demonstrate that when it comes to a call to action, Australian marketers place domain names above any other medium, including social media. Our analysis of the 67 ads aired during both Grand Finals has revealed several important themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study by ARI Registry Service revealed that domains were used as primary call to action in 32 vs. social media only 8 times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ariservices.com/grand_final_marketing-infographic.php&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-10-12-ari-infographics.png&quot; alt=&quot;ari-infographics.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further strong indicator that social media is only a complementing tool for engaging with customers but owning your web address is still the best way to advertise your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mein Host: The Beer Essentials</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-10-12-beerglasses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;beerglasses.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craft beer craze is sweeping the country as micro-breweries pop up all over the show. Now some of the early craft brew pioneers are spreading their wings as well. Moa is doing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;amp;objectid=10840093&quot;&gt;trendy IPO&lt;/a&gt; and Tuatara just had their fantastic new facilities on the Kapiti Coast &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=49141&quot;&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; by a certain rather forgetful high profile politician. The beer scene is clearly undergoing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.renaissancebrewing.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/warm-welcome-for-web-developers.html&quot;&gt;welcomed&lt;/a&gt; the WDCNZ speakers and delegates with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; drinks at Tap Haus, including a special delivery of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2012/03/bitches-and-birds-startup-craft-beermakers-have-fu&quot;&gt;Parrot Dog Brewery&lt;/a&gt; product that everyone loved (ones to watch we reckon). What does all of this have to do with domains, you ask? Well, for starters, when you run a company with German co-founders, it&amp;#39;s hard to avoid discussions about good beer. But apart from that, we also have some great beer domains on our books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pal, former journalist Martin Craig, has been doing a wonderful job with &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://nzbeerblog.com/&quot;&gt;nzbeerblog&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, he decided to get a real job this year, which has put a halt to any more humourous and informative articles, for the time being. But his blog remains packed with articles and advice about craft beer that is still relevant today. We also hooked up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebrewhouse.co.nz/&quot;&gt;The Brewhouse&lt;/a&gt; with a domain. It&amp;#39;s not a pub, it&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting/&quot;&gt;online shop&lt;/a&gt; where you can purchase all your own beer making kit. If you are a fan of American craft beer, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beerfellows.com/&quot;&gt;BeerFellows&lt;/a&gt; report on the Great American Beer Festival which is going on this weekend. Finally, a plug for our neighbours over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlebeerquarter.co.nz/&quot;&gt;LBQ&lt;/a&gt; who not only have an amazing selection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emersons.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Emersons&lt;/a&gt; on tap, but also a delicious German pretzel deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a beer related domain? We have a selection of almost 100 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;global domains&lt;/a&gt; on tap. That only leaves us with one burning question remaining on a Friday afternoon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://isitbeeroclockyet.com/&quot;&gt;Is it beer o&amp;#39;clock yet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sweden and Portugal Join the iwantmyname Domain Family</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;register the Swedish (.SE) and Portuguese (.PT) country code top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; at iwantmyname. Both domain extensions are the preferred choice for local websites or email addresses in the respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sweden&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-10-05-Sweden-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sweden-Flag-128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third largest nation in the European Union only has a population of 10 million people but is a leading force on the internet with successful services such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://spotify.com&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pingdom.com&quot;&gt;Pingdom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepiratebay.se&quot;&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt; originating from the Scandinavian country. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iis.se/&quot;&gt;more than 1.2 million .SE domains registered&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden has one of the highest number of web addresses per capita. The Swedish suffix is also popular for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; such as anonymy.se, likewi.se or surpri.se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that for individuals or companies located in Sweden a valid Swedish personal ID or organizational number is required. Outside of Sweden any other ID number (e.g. Passport, drivers licensce, tax number) is accepted. Companies in the European Union MUST provide their value added tax identification number (VAT ID).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/se-swedish-domain-name-registration-for-sweden&quot;&gt;.SE domains&lt;/a&gt; are available for $39 USD per year. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/se-domain-registrar-transfer-sweden&quot;&gt;transfer your .SE domains to iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Portugal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-10-05-Portugal-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Portugal-Flag-128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Portuguese Republic is the westernmost country of Europe and is similar to Sweden in terms of population size. Until earlier this year it was only possible to register second-level .COM.PT domains for international registrants so there might be still some great .PT names available. Portugal&amp;#39;s namespace has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dns.pt/total-de-dominios-registados_activos&quot;&gt;total of 240,000 registrations&lt;/a&gt; at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While registration of the .PT domain extension is open to anyone worldwide but requires additional information (VAT ID for European companies or tax number for individuals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pt-portuguese-domain-name-registration-for-portugal&quot;&gt;purchase .PT domains&lt;/a&gt; at a yearly registration fee of $59 USD. Domain transfers to iwantmyname are not possible at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/se-swedish-domain-name-registration-for-sweden&quot;&gt;Register your .SE web address now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/se-domain-registrar-transfer-sweden&quot;&gt;Transfer a .SE domain to iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pt-portuguese-domain-name-registration-for-portugal&quot;&gt;Purchase the .PT domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Starting Up New Zealand</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-09-21-lunch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lunch.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#39;ve loved playing a part in starting up Startup Weekend across New Zealand. We&amp;#39;ve provided technical and business mentorship, organiser team management resources, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/wonderful-wellington-startup-w.html&quot;&gt;prizes and cash sponsorship&lt;/a&gt; - not to mention given away loads of free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judges at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://tauranga.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Tauranga Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; reported that the final presentations were of the highest standard ever. That&amp;#39;s a testament to all of the organisers, mentors, sponsors and participants who collaborate to bring each event to life. I&amp;#39;m sure we haven&amp;#39;t seen the last of Sheldon Nesdale, Rowan Yeoman and the team, who did a fantastic job bringing it all together this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend was my fourth, but it was actually my first as a player (that&amp;#39;s our team pictured). It sure provided a whole new perspective and reminded me that start-up entrepreneurs need a sturdy emotional foundation to succeed. Expect to encounter inspiration, joy, anger, frustration and elation on your Startup Weekend roller-coaster. It&amp;#39;s like a microcosm of a real life business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now that we&amp;#39;ve all returned to planet Earth, I want to thank the talented team who took that short space flight with me. Peter, mission control - you kept us on track and bravely took on the challenge of presenting. Kristy, your marketing and design skills were heaven sent. Joshua, the gentle giant who rightly insisted on a design-centric focus, keep aiming for the stars! Bjorn, our engineering officer, thanks for being a techie sounding board and putting me in my place when it was needed. Nigel, our loyal foot soldier and ideas enthusiast (you were joking about the urinal ads, right?). Thank-you one and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every event has it&amp;#39;s own flavour. Tourism and recreation figured prominently in the discussions at Tauranga. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tauranga.startupweekend.org/2012/09/19/in-the-media-bay-of-plenty-times-article-about-the-winning-startup-at-tauranga-startup-weekend-2012/&quot;&gt;Standby&lt;/a&gt; was the (rightful) winning team on the night with an idea that may actually save lives on the water. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://messagetap.me/&quot;&gt;MessageTap&lt;/a&gt;, appropriately, got the award for &amp;quot;most studious&amp;quot; team. But, if just one person goes on to start a future business or share an idea or kick off a social venture having been inspired by this weekend, then we have all succeeded. New Zealand needs this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space for more Startup Weekends coming very soon and check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;apps marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for the coolest domain customisable hosted services that get your start-up business up and running faster.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New .KIWI.NZ Domain Stretches Wings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-09-13-kiwi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kiwi.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be a small flightless bird with poor eyesight, but our national symbol has proven to be a popular choice amongst New Zealand domain name fans. Over 1500 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/kiwi.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.KIWI.NZ domains&lt;/a&gt; were registered in the first hour of sales when the plucky little bird was released into the wild this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creation of the domain within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.NZ family&lt;/a&gt; puts a blow torch on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/01/dot-kiwi-domain-takes-flight.html&quot;&gt;dot Kiwi registry&lt;/a&gt; which began a lengthy and expensive accreditation process for a new top level domain through ICANN earlier this year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dotkiwi&quot;&gt;register your interest for .KIWI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of customers have asked why we were not accepting orders from day one. The chief issue for us has been the provisional registration period which we could not implement due to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetnews.me/2012/09/04/kiwi-nz-registrations-opening-september-11th/&quot;&gt;restrictive domain policies&lt;/a&gt;. We appreciate this has led to disappointment for some. So we&amp;#39;d like to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Kiwis are a rare and endangered native bird species in New Zealand. For every .kiwi.nz domain registered through iwantmyname in September, we will donate $2 to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/karori-sanctuary-trust/&quot;&gt;Karori Wildlife Sanctuary Trust&lt;/a&gt; towards their excellent Kiwi preservation work. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/kiwi.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;Get your .KIWI.NZ domain today and help save kiwis in the wild&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Apps Empowering Digital Communities</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-09-04-panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;panel.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Digital Earth Summit&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;#39;ve been hearing a lot about how digital communities of interest can leverage a variety of new technologies to get involved in making a difference to society and the environment. So we started looking at some cool New Zealand made apps that help deliver on these goals and which were also featured at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://friendsafe.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Friendsafe&lt;/a&gt; are a young team of entrepreneurs that sprang out of a recent Startup Weekend event. FriendSafe is a mobile app that enables journey sharing from start point to destination in order to improve a traveller&amp;#39;s sense of personal safety. The app includes an emergency alerting service involving audio, video and geo-location data. The app also generates notifications about potential dangers and incident statistics drawing on government open data. We were pleased when Friendsafe won the Startup Weekend open data award sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linz.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;LINZ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Mix&amp;amp;Mash&lt;/a&gt; and it was thrilling seeing the team making some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/speaker/geospatial-technologist-of-google&quot;&gt;influential friends&lt;/a&gt; after their conference presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseas delegates at the summit have been learning a great deal about New Zealand&amp;#39;s beautiful natural environment and especially how geo-spatial technology is being used to protect species under threat. &lt;a href=&quot;http://whioforever.co.nz/whio-forever/&quot;&gt;WhioForever&lt;/a&gt; is a project that generates crowd-sourced data to monitor populations of the endangered Blue Duck (Whio). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://loomio.org/&quot;&gt;Loomio&lt;/a&gt; is an open web-based tool that enables participative decision-making for organisations. Loomio team members played a big role in the lively panel session on &amp;#39;Growing Up Digital&amp;#39; at the close of day two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://pocket.jobs/&quot;&gt;PocketJobs&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#39;t feature at Digital Earth, but it&amp;#39;s a nice example of an application that not only solves a problem but builds a social community that actually generates some real value. PocketJobs makes it easy to match &amp;#39;micro-task&amp;#39; offers with willing workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is a global domain registrar providing internet infrastructure that enables &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;next generation apps&lt;/a&gt;. We also support community based initiatives that promote entrepreneurship and positive environmental and social outcomes through the intelligent use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.CO Domain Deal Sparks Startup Flame</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-09-01-dotco.png&quot; alt=&quot;dotco.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/02/co-domain---what-will-you-build.html&quot;&gt;challenged you&lt;/a&gt; to think about contributing to rebuilding the economy through entrepreneurship. We also explained how the .CO registry is building a reputation as a secure and popular digital foundation for start-ups. Now from September we can pass on a fantastic reduction in the price of your .CO domain, so there&amp;#39;s no excuse for not signing up and getting your .COOL new business online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of this year we can offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO domains&lt;/a&gt; for only $19. That&amp;#39;s a huge reduction of 42% and a great domain deal for companies that are just starting out. There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.go.co/case-studies/&quot;&gt;fantastic new companies&lt;/a&gt; already using .CO domains, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://angel.co/&quot;&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://duck.co/&quot;&gt;Duck.co&lt;/a&gt; the Duck Duck Go user community. The .CO domain space is relatively under-populated at present, so it&amp;#39;s an attractive option if you are looking at building a great brand online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your plans are for your new .CO domain, don&amp;#39;t forget iwantmyname helps you to find a bunch of hosted services that can be easily domain customised to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;get your online venture up and running quickly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>3 Easy Steps To Ruin The Reputation Of A Country&#39;s Domain Extension</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve recently announced a substantial &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/adamsnames-advises-extraordinary-price-increase-for-tc-registrations-and-other-changes-to-gd-vg-doma.html&quot;&gt;price increase for .TC domains&lt;/a&gt; and were even more shocked when we received further details from the new registry managers. As a registrar there is not much that can be done about such a change but we thought you should know what&amp;#39;s sometimes happening in the background of the domain name industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, some terminology. There are registrants (you as the domain owner), registrars (us or our suppliers) and registries (the body managing a certain domain extension). If you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;order a domain through iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, we pass it on to the source registry, e.g. Verisign for .COM and .NET or Adamsnames in the case .GD, .VG and the aforementioned .TC country code top-level domain (ccTLD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price increases are nothing unusual for domains, e.g. Verisign raised prices by 7% earlier this year. They do happen and -- although not always justifiable -- there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/08/why-some-domain-extensions-are-more-expensive-than-others.html&quot;&gt;many factors that determine TLD pricing&lt;/a&gt;. However, the recent price increase by the .TC registry is nothing short of unbelievable, is not in the interest of domain owners and can only be seen as profiteering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the big deal now, what changed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The .TC registry is currently offline and will re-open somewhen in October. That&amp;#39;s right, no new .TC domains at present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have tripled prices for existing domains and new registrations for no apparent reason and without much explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short 2-letter domains now cost more than 3,000 British Pounds -- bad luck if you&amp;#39;ve used a domain since a couple of years already. You&amp;#39;ll find yourself paying lots more suddenly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you trust a domain extension that makes such changes? We certainly don&amp;#39;t and consequently iwantmyname will no longer offer the registration of new .TC domains,  when the registry opens again in October.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Booting Startup Weekend&#39;s Mix &amp; Mashup</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-08-27-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated: Mon 27 August&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend was held for the first time outside of a main centre and entrepreneurs in Palmerston North and the surrounding region ably rose to the occasion. &lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s For Lunch&lt;/strong&gt; took out the top prize with a tablet app concept to make healthy cooking and eating fun for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We remember what it&amp;#39;s like to be a tech start-up. Aspiring entrepreneurs need all the advice and support they can get during the early stages. As a society we must also assist people to connect and share ideas and ingrain a stronger sense of entrepreneurial culture in New Zealand, especially amongst young people. That&amp;#39;s why we love Startup Weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; offered free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt; to every team that progressed from the initial pitching sessions, plus we co-sponsored drinks on Friday evening at the opening. But wait, that&amp;#39;s not all! We helped pull together a fantastic prize package for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/2012/06/27/digital-earth-offers-open-data-app-opp/&quot;&gt;Open Data App category&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/competitions&quot;&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash&lt;/a&gt; and the global &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalearth12.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Digital Earth Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The requirement was to build an application that leverages New Zealand open data sources, with $1000 in cash and gifts on offer. It was heartening to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://friendsafe.co.nz/&quot;&gt;FriendSafe&lt;/a&gt; take out this award with their geo-location app for keeping travelers safe. Well done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, we also recommend a whole bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developer tools&lt;/a&gt; that can be hosted on your domain, so you can get your Startup Weekend projects up and running even faster. The next New Zealand Startup Weekend will be in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tauranga.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Tauranga&lt;/a&gt; 14-16 September.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dear Google, Please Add .IO To The List Of Generic Domains In Webmaster Tools</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com/webmastertools&quot;&gt;Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt; is a free service allowing site owners to check certain metrics and adjust settings, e.g. search engine crawling errors or managing the robots.txt file. The service also lets you geo-target domains, for example, if you are using a .com domain, you can tell Google how the site should appear in their search results for specific geographic regions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9r3PayqaZM&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.DE (Germany)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.ES (Spain)&lt;/a&gt; cannot be targeted to an international audience but there are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=1347922&quot;&gt;few exceptions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.AS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize&quot;&gt;.BZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands&quot;&gt;.CC&lt;/a&gt;, .CD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt;, .DJ, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&quot;&gt;.LA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.MS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nu-domain-name-registration-for-niue&quot;&gt;.NU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sc-seychellois-domain-name-registration-for-seychelles&quot;&gt;.SC&lt;/a&gt;, .SR, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau&quot;&gt;.TK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa&quot;&gt;.WS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these TLDs you can set a geographic target through Webmaster Tools, e.g. use a .CO domain in the United States or Canada although it is actually the official domain extension of Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now recently the owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pineapple.io&quot;&gt;pineapple.io&lt;/a&gt; contacted us asking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I purchased a .io domain. I know you arent an SEO company but i was wondering, given that you are domain experts, do you know if there were any plans to make .io a gTLD? ... It&amp;#39;s a shame that I can&amp;#39;t really target the US, DESPITE the fact that it is used as a domain hack for many tech websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it&amp;#39;s a really good question and have been wondering this for a while at iwantmyname, especially since the British Indian Ocean Territory is currently only inhabited by military personnel. The company behind registry service Nic.io also is one of the largest DNS infrastructure providers worldwide which guarantees stable technical operation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO TLD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly there is an ever growing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Which-companies-use-io-domains&quot;&gt;list of international startups using .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; and at the time of writing this article, popular tech news aggregator &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; had four(!) .IO sites (&lt;a href=&quot;http://meetings.io&quot;&gt;meetings.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://filepicker.io&quot;&gt;filepicker.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloc.io&quot;&gt;bloc.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://avatars.io&quot;&gt;avatars.io&lt;/a&gt;) on their front page. We also have popular open source projects &lt;a href=&quot;http://redis.io&quot;&gt;redis.io&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://socket.io&quot;&gt;socket.io&lt;/a&gt;, blogging services &lt;a href=&quot;http://soup.io&quot;&gt;soup.io&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://pen.io&quot;&gt;pen.io&lt;/a&gt; and many, many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join our appeal to Google to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO domains&lt;/a&gt; as a generic country code top-level domain in Webmaster Tools and show your support by leaving a comment or sharing this article!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>App Developers: Make A Splash At Startup Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-08-22-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next New Zealand Startup Weekend has rolled around and we hear that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://palmynorth.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Palmerston North event&lt;/a&gt; is almost sold out already. That&amp;#39;s a testament to all of the organisers, sponsors and media that have got behind the global initiative and especially to all the participants who played so far. Startup Weekend makes entrepreneurial education fun and interactive which is fantastic because we need to boost and celebrate entrepreneurial culture more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally we are right behind Palmy Startup Weekend, in the same way we backed every other event since &lt;a href=&quot;http://unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/leadership/the-2012-influencers-the-hustler&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend first arrived&lt;/a&gt; here. We&amp;#39;re co-sponsoring drinks at the launch party and providing a free .COM, NET, .ORG or .NZ &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; for each team that goes forward from Friday evening. We are also co-sponsoring a juicy $1000 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/competitions&quot;&gt;Mix&amp;amp;Mash prize&lt;/a&gt; for the best open data app. So get thinking about what kind of apps you can build that transform and add value to government data in some way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;building and domain customising a splash page&lt;/a&gt; or a posting simple business brochure website.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Short Domain Search Made Easy!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;new iwantmyname search&lt;/a&gt; is the ability to check domain availability for ultra-short domains. If you enter a 2-letter domain, we will automatically display only search results for top-level domains (TLDs) allowing registration of these little gems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-08-17-short-domain-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;Short Domain Search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;list of country code TLDs supporting domains consisting of two characters&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/af-afghan-domain-name-registration-for-afghanistan&quot;&gt;.AF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ag-domain-name-registration-for-antigua-and-barbuda&quot;&gt;.AG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cx-domain-name-registration-for-christmas-island&quot;&gt;.CX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gd-grenadian-domain-name-registration-for-grenada&quot;&gt;.GD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland&quot;&gt;.GL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gs-domain-name-registration-for-south-georgia-and-the-south-sandwich-islands&quot;&gt;.GS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gy-guyanese-domain-name-registration-for-guyana&quot;&gt;.GY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ht-haitian-domain-name-registration-for-haiti&quot;&gt;.HT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.MS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mu-mauritian-domain-name-registration-for-mauritius&quot;&gt;.MU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pe-peruvian-domain-name-registration-for-peru&quot;&gt;.PE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste&quot;&gt;.TL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/vg-domain-name-registration-for-british-virgin-islands&quot;&gt;.VG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short domains are a rare commodity, for example there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/05/100-shockingly-short-io-domain-names-available-today.html&quot;&gt;less than 100 letter-only 2-char .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; left! Grab a tiny web address for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/&quot;&gt;URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;start your short domain search now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;New .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; are currently on sale @ 69.00 USD!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Of Digital Earth</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-08-16-earth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;earth.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landsat, the orbiting Earth imaging satellite has been faithfully transmitting data home for forty years. Now with the aid of &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthengine.google.org/&quot;&gt;Google Earth Engine&lt;/a&gt;, scientists can perform amazing time series studies across the globe on all sorts of natural features as well as looking at cultural impacts such as deforestation, urban sprawl and agricultural land use. Opening up of this data puts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezn1ne2Fj6Y&quot;&gt;new perspectives&lt;/a&gt; on the concept of a digital earth and has implications for a remote island nation such as New Zealand that depends heavily on natural resource exploitation to earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Earth Engine aggregates the world&amp;#39;s satellite imagery—making it available online for researchers to map trends and quantify differences around the Earth.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/&quot;&gt;Landsat&lt;/a&gt; passes over the same bit of ground every sixteen days and has documented a vast amount of the Earth&amp;#39;s surface sequentially. This data was first made publicly available in 2008. But until recently it was difficult to work with. The evolution of inexpensive, high speed distributed computing changed all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Earth has come to mean an interdependent set of technologies that bring the hope of better addressing global environmental and societal challenges.  As the technology for digitally observing our world improves, we may also begin to contemplate how we preserve our own personal digital legacy and where this sits in the wider context of digital earth. Anchoring your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;online profile&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; remains the most enduring way to secure and manage your digital earth space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalearth12.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Digital Earth Summit&lt;/a&gt; opens in Wellington on 2nd September. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; is a proud co-sponsor of this year&amp;#39;s open data &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/competitions&quot;&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash competition&lt;/a&gt; at Startup Weekends in conjunction with the Digital Earth Summit and Land Information New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Adamsnames Advises Extraordinary Price Increase For .TC Registrations And Other Changes To .GD &amp; .VG Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We thought we should let you know about a very substantial price increase that has recently been invoked by &lt;a href=&quot;http://adamsnames.tc&quot;&gt;Adamsnames&lt;/a&gt;, the registry operator for .TC, .GD and .VG domains. Unfortunately we have no choice but to pass these increases on to our customers and we apologize for this unexpected change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new price for a .TC domain will be $119.00 USD annually, effective immediately. We have suspended new orders until further notice but existing registrations can still be managed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard&quot;&gt;your iwantmyname dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a .TC domain that is due for renewal, you may be considering whether or not you wish to continue to invest in maintaining the domain. We&amp;#39;d hate to lose you, but (under the circumstances) if you choose to &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/235018-how-do-i-cancel-my-domain-registration-&quot;&gt;cancel your domain&lt;/a&gt;—we will understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adamsnames also announced a major system upgrade and is moving to a new registry back end. After the migration, new registrations and domain updates will be handled in real-time. Furthermore &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;changing registrars of .GD and .VG domains&lt;/a&gt; now follow the industry-standard transfer procedure using authorization codes. Due to this upgrade we were able to reduce the price for new registrations as well as transfers of Grenada&amp;#39;s and British Virgin Island&amp;#39;s domain extensions from $49 to $45 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goeiedag! Lotjhani! Dumela! Sawubona! Avuxeni! Ndaa! Molo! Sawubona!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-08-08-South-Africa-Flag-256.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flag South Africa&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.za-south-african-domain-name-registration-for-south-africa&quot;&gt;South-African top-level domain (TLD) .co.za&lt;/a&gt; has just been added to iwantmyname&amp;#39;s portfolio of international extensions. Registration is unrestricted meaning companies and individuals worldwide can purchase this TLD. South Africa is Africa&amp;#39;s largest economy with a population of almost 50 million people. The republic shares borders with Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All new .co.za domains are priced at $US 12.50/yr and transfers cost $US 20.00 which includes a 1-year renewal. You will not lose any previously paid term when &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.za-domain-registrar-transfer-south-africa&quot;&gt;transferring your .co.za web address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registering your own .co.za web address has never been more simple. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;Start your domain search now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname Scores International Gold In Domains Finale</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-07-31-gold.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gold.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the sporting world might be on the medal count at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.london2012.com/&quot;&gt;London 2012 Olympics&lt;/a&gt; right now, but our customers are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;telling us&lt;/a&gt; that we&amp;#39;ve already won a gold medal with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html&quot;&gt;new design&lt;/a&gt;. We love getting that kind of feedback. In the meantime...are your favorite athletes winning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. womens&amp;#39; soccer team has been keeping gold medal hopes alive this week as well as keeping the sports gossip columnists abuzz, in the lead up to the U.S. vs North Korea grudge match. Controversial goal keeper &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/us-olympic-goalkeeper-solo-doesnt-back-down-from-tweets-critical-of-nbc-analyst-chastain/2012/07/30/gJQAgYNkKX_story.html&quot;&gt;Hope Solo&lt;/a&gt; found herself in hot water after tweeting some rather harsh criticism of a media commentator. It was a timely reminder of how we need to manage our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;online profile&lt;/a&gt; carefully in an age of near instantaneous reportage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, U.K. sports fans (and royal watchers) have been charting hopefully the progress of Zara Phillips who has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18906141&quot;&gt;performing strongly&lt;/a&gt; in the equestrian events. There were also big smiles all round as the the British mens gymnasts earned an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/gymnastics/9439776/London-2012-Olympics-Team-GB-gymnasts-on-a-roll.html&quot;&gt;unexpected bronze&lt;/a&gt;, the first Olympic medal in that sport for the U.K. in over a century. Fanatic about Olympic sports? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=zaraphillips&amp;amp;hideUnavailable=false&quot;&gt;search for a domain&lt;/a&gt; based on your favorite athlete and go global with an informative domain customized sports &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Wonderful Wellington Startup Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-07-27-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t believe another Startup Weekend has rolled around already! The global new venture development initiative has been taking New Zealand by storm as word has spread amongst developers, designers and young entrepreneurs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; is being held in our home town of Wellington this time, which means the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; will be right in the thick of it once again this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been involved with Startup Weekend in New Zealand since the very first event through sponsorships, domain name giveaways as well as assisting with event management and mentoring at various times. At this event we are also co-sponsoring a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/booting-startup-weekends-mix-mashup.html&quot;&gt;special prize&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with Mix &amp;amp; Mash and the Digital Earth Summit, aimed specifically at teams leveraging open data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for the big new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; banner at Startup Weekends throughout New Zealand to claim a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; for your team. Don&amp;#39;t forget, we also make it one-click easy to set up a wide range of handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developer services&lt;/a&gt; and apps on your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend is bringing 54 hours of start-up goodness to a town near you very soon. The Wellington event is full, but we are also &lt;a href=&quot;http://palmynorth.startupweekend.org/2012/07/13/iwantmyname-partners-with-startup-weekend-palmerston-north/&quot;&gt;supporting Palmerston North Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; which kicks off on 24th August.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Brand New iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re happy to announce the launch of our site redesign and new iwantmyname logo. As mentioned last week this refresh is a first step towards a new control panel which will speed up the interaction with your domains dramatically. We can&amp;#39;t wait to share it with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-07-25-iwmn.png&quot; alt=&quot;iwmn.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A new logo designed by New Zealand based designer &lt;a href=&quot;http://jarredbishop.info/&quot;&gt;Jarred Bishop&lt;/a&gt; who you also might know as the developer of several &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/04/3-awesome-simple-tumblr-themes-designed-by-jarred-bishop.html&quot;&gt;awesome Tumblr themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search&quot;&gt;Faster domain search&lt;/a&gt; with all &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;100+ domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; on one single page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The layout has been moved to Twitter&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap framework&lt;/a&gt;, customized to our needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Small improvements to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and iwantmyname dashboard, mainly a new internal navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d also like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitbybit.io&quot;&gt;Wellington developers bit by bit&lt;/a&gt; who have been working with us on the new site. And now what are you waiting for? Check out the new site and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Squarespace 6 Pumps Up Online Identity</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-07-23-squarespace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;squarespace.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted website builder service Squarespace has been offering bloggers, website developers and other professionals a creative home base for almost a decade now. But that hasn&amp;#39;t made them complacent about innovating. In fact the latest iteration of the popular website builder demonstrates how the company is evolving with the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your web presence is a direct extension of your personality&amp;quot;, says Squarespace CEO and founder Anthony Casalena, as the company &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.squarespace.com/introducing-squarespace-6&quot;&gt;rolls out Squarespace 6&lt;/a&gt;, a new improved version of its software. We tend to agree with that philosophy, which is why Squarespace was one of the earliest services to be promoted within our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;marketplace for hosted apps&lt;/a&gt;. With over 1.4 million websites hosted, they surely must be doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace 6 continues the success story by offering richer design context within its template offerings plus painless integration with popular social platforms. Importantly, sites built on Squarespace 6 benefit from automatic mobile optimization and will ultimately allow full developer control over front end code. Squarespace hits a sweet spot between &amp;quot;technology and style&amp;quot;, that will ensure their longevity in a highly competitive space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#39;re planning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/08/5-domain-extensions-for-your-personal-website.html&quot;&gt;buy a personal domain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;switch registrars&lt;/a&gt;, iWantMyName makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;setting up custom domains for Squarespace one-click easy&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Warm Welcome For Web Developers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are a major sponsor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wdcnz.com/&quot;&gt;WDCNZ&lt;/a&gt; this year and (fortuitously) it coincides with the launch of our wonderful site redesign. Therefore, we thought it highly appropriate to celebrate this stupendous occasion by organising a pre-event &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/events/wdcnz_welcome_drinks&quot;&gt;social function&lt;/a&gt; for Web Dev Con delegates at &lt;strong&gt;5.00pm on Wednesday 1st August at Tap Haus, Cnr Victoria &amp;amp; Dixon Streets, Wellington&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We especially want to welcome visitors from outside the region and also say a big thank-you to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt; community who have been amongst our biggest supporters (and critics). The site migration has taken place and we&amp;#39;d love to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;new design&lt;/a&gt; from all of you. As we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; recently, we are only as good as the people around us and we are driven to provide the most friendly and easy to use service for global &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain registration&lt;/a&gt; and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a web developer visiting Wellington for WDCNZ, locally based dev or simply a recent customer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, then we&amp;#39;d love to see you. We&amp;#39;re getting some delicious (and rare) Parrot Dog ales sorted, so you&amp;#39;ll need a secret code word to score a nice cold pint of local craft beer on us. Make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/events/wdcnz_welcome_drinks&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; through Unlimited Potential, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;drop us an email&lt;/a&gt; or simply DM us on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;NZ Twitter&lt;/a&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iWantMyName Site Migration Next Week</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the week starting July 23, we&amp;#39;re making some updates to our service. The changes will take about 24 hours and not involve any downtime of your domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s changing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re introducing a new logo, site design and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/new-faster-domain-search.html&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; which is much faster and allows filtering of search results. There will also be small tweaks to our dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of the new home page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-07-17-new-website-small.png&quot; alt=&quot;New iWantMyName Home Page&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will I be affected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your domains will not be affected by the change. However, you might not be able to log in to our dashboard temporarily, purchase new domains or start a domain transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to make any changes to your domains (e.g. update DNS records) we recommend doing them before the migration begins on Monday, Jul 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s coming next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue our mission to make domain management a painless experience. The new design is a first step towards an improved dashboard which is currently under development. So stay tuned for more updates in the coming months!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Beware Of Domain Name Renewal Scams</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Different &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_scams&quot;&gt;types of domain name scams&lt;/a&gt; have been around for many years, yet many domain owners are still unaware of the issue. The scams range from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/2010/09/23/the-asian-domain-name-extortion-scam&quot;&gt;threatening to register available versions of your name or brand&lt;/a&gt; to phishing emails to get your username and password. One of the most common scams is the attempt of tricking customers into transferring domains to another registrar who charges an exorbitant amount for domain renewals. Quite often these attempts are made by post to make it look more legit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example letter &amp;quot;Domain Renewal Group&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-06-26-domain-renewal-scam-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Domain Renewal Scam Letter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to check when you receive an email or letter regarding your domain registration, renewal or transfer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember you will never receive a written letter from us to register, renew or transfer a domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the sender address of renewal (or other) notification emails. All our notifications and reminders are sent from an email address ending in &amp;#39;@iwantmyname.com&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;@support.iwantmyname.com&amp;#39;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always make sure you are on iwantmyname.com in your browser&amp;#39;s address bar before entering any login information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;ve come acress many domain name scams over the years as you can imagine. If in doubt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>More New Domains .WTF?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;ICANN&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/new-top-level-domain-list.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;big reveal&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; exposed the plans of numerous registry aspirants who plan to have a tilt at creating their own new top level domains (TLDs). Now the Internet&amp;#39;s governing authority has to wade through almost two thousand individual applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions of an eighteen month turnaround time for applicants are looking rather optimistic at this point. But whilst the domain gnomes at ICANN are pondering these multitudinous possibilities, sit down and grab yourself a .BEER. Here&amp;#39;s a glimpse at some of the more amusing TLDs that might just be winging their way into our browser address bars in the near future &lt;strong&gt;.JUSTFORU&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-06-18-regretful-transformer-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;regretful-transformer-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital domains for tech geeks are .COOL this year. If you are a .DEV .NINJA, we&amp;#39;ve got you covered. You can host your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/app-domain-names-will-create-new-naming-opportunities-for-developers.html&quot;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt; in the .CLOUD, after all it&amp;#39;s the safest place to be when the .TRANSFORMERS invade from outer .SPACE . Blue pill or red one? We can&amp;#39;t wait to enter the .MATRIX to do battle with the dreaded .BOT. After a trippy experience like that, I&amp;#39;m surprised someone didn&amp;#39;t nominate .POT. But that may be going a little too far...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen whether any of these proposed TLDs actually make the final cut. Some will likely .FAIL, but it&amp;#39;s been fun imagining .LOL :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Ultimate List Of New Top-Level Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The long wait is finally over! In a press event held in London (starting at midday UK time), &lt;a href=&quot;http://icann.org&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; is about to reveal the final list of new top-level domain (TLD) applicants. There have been a few announcements over the last couple of weeks already but we&amp;#39;re sure to be in for some more surprises today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/9382-its-reveal-day-and-there-are-1930-new-gtld-bids&quot;&gt;DomainIncite reports&lt;/a&gt; there are 1,930 bids in total with some interesting statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;66 self-designated geographic applications, aiming to represent many of the world&amp;#39;s cities and regions. That&amp;#39;s 3.4% of the total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationalized domain names &amp;mdash; gTLDs in non-Latin scripts &amp;mdash; account for 116 applications, or 6% of the total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications that have been pushed into the the tricky &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; route stand at 84, or 4.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations from a total of 60 countries are participating in the round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North American businesses account for a little under half of all applications, with 911 (47.2%) active bids. Europe is the next largest with 675 (35%), followed by Asia-Pacific with 303 (15.7%)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good news for applicants from Latin American and the Caribbean and from Africa. With just 24 (1.2%) and 17 (0.9%) applications respectively, they&amp;#39;re pretty much all guaranteed a spot in the first evaluation batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICANN&amp;#39;s press conference is being streamed live &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/news/press/kits/reveal-day-video-13jun12-en.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Top-Level Domain List&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full list including more information can also be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/https://gtldresult.icann.org/application-result/applicationstatus&quot;&gt;ICANN&amp;#39;s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All TLD applications (Latin alphabet):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What you need to know about nTLDs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain extensions mentioned above will not be available for registration anytime soon. There is still lots of behind the scenes work to do for the ICANN community, e.g. if there are multiple parties applying for the same strings, they might be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Furthermore these suffixes will be introduced gradually with different launch dates for trademark holders and the general public. It could also be that a popular TLD goes to a corporate, for example General Motors getting .cars, and they will use it for their own purposes instead of opening registration to everyone. So at the moment everything about launch dates and registration policies is pure speculation. If you have any further questions about new TLDs, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cargo Website Showcases Retro Revival</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-06-12-revival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;revival.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the brightly coloured, tartan woolen blankets that your parents used to set up summer picnics on down at the beach? Those iconic blankies are now enjoying a second life as upholstering on recycled furniture. Brilliant idea, or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Cottrell, a lover of both classic furniture and wool, moved to New Zealand almost thirty years ago to start a family. As a sheep farmer&amp;#39;s wife, living in the rugged hills above Taihape, she soon gained a powerful respect for the warmth and hardiness of woolen clothing and furnishings. From that respect sprang a cottage industry involving recovering and re-upholstering furniture using the very same woolen blankets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our website of the month &lt;a href=&quot;http://revivalfurniture.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Revival Furnishings&lt;/a&gt; promotes a steady stream of recycled furniture in a vast array of shapes, sizes and patterns. The company built and hosted their attractive online brochure using &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt; a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt; application that is getting huge traction worldwide. Apart from being a brilliant Kiwi example of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; branded home-made website, we love the way the company recycles classic furniture and makes it look uber-chic again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up your personal domain on a wide range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;hosted apps and services&lt;/a&gt; with our easy one click DNS manager. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;Transfer&lt;/a&gt; your .NZ domain to iWantMyName for free or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for a new international domain today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.APP Domain Names Will Create New Naming Opportunities For Developers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, the web address space &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/49-new-top-level-domain-bids-released-so-far.html&quot;&gt;is about to grow&lt;/a&gt; by hundreds of new suffixes in addition to the well-known .COM, .NET or .ORG over the course of the next few years. While the announcement of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gtldresult.icann.org/application-result/applicationstatus&quot;&gt;final list of new top-level domains (TLDs)&lt;/a&gt; by the internet&amp;#39;s governing body ICANN is only two days away, there is one domain extension that gets us particularly excited at iWantMyName and that is the proposed .APP TLD. Today we are having a closer look at this future naming option for application developers, web apps and everyone&amp;#39;s beloved smartphone software goodies as an example of how the name space expansion can benefit domain owners as well as end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;YourSoftwareApp.com vs YourSoftware.app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-06-12-i-pad-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does the .APP suffix offer to application developers? First of all, the days of simply appending &amp;#39;app&amp;#39; as in yoursoftwareAPP.com or prefixing your domain with &amp;#39;get&amp;#39;, e.g. GETsoftwarename.com and settling for an inferior web address will finally be over! We see these type of domains being registered almost on a daily basis at iWantMyName and .APP domains would certainly increase the chances of getting the name you really want for your site. The dotAPP ending could be used for marketing desktop software on Mac, Windows or Linux, general web applications and obviously apps for iOS devices such as iPhone or iPad and Android powered smartphones or tablets. It&amp;#39;s simply a platform-independent internet address for any kind of software but at the same time easy to recognize as a trusted source to find information about an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-06-12-android.png&quot; alt=&quot;Android&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just imagine a popular game, for example Angry Birds, on the domain AngryBirds.app with links to app stores where it can be downloaded. Wouldn&amp;#39;t that come in handy? Of course, the naysayers will tell you that the same can be done on any other top-level domain. If users who want to download your application see .COM and .APP web addresses in their search result which one will be more likely clicked, though? Adoption might take a while but once they know that .APP gets them faster to the desired information, it will become their preferred choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What are the next steps for .APP?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know yet which company will manage the back end for .APP (there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/9212-third-app-gtld-applicant-revealed&quot;&gt;three companies competing already&lt;/a&gt;) and the winner might bring even more to the table such as integration with existing app stores or an integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/app.net-custom-domain&quot;&gt;website builder for apps&lt;/a&gt;. They could also play an important role in your app&amp;#39;s distribution channel and make it the go-to place for managing content or submitting new versions for different marketplaces. Let&amp;#39;s just hope the future registry &amp;mdash; whoever it may be &amp;mdash; will not restrict the namespace in a way that makes it difficult for the global developer community to register domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, you can still relax. There will be at least 12-18 months until you might be able to register .APP domains. Once it&amp;#39;s clear who will be managing the namespace, we will provide you with further information. And if you need a web address for your app in the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;our domain search can help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>49 New Top-Level Domain Bids Revealed So Far</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This month marks an important milestone for the domain community with the big reveal of all new top-level domain (TLD) applicants on June 13. After years of hard work, lots of discussions and numerous delays, the internet&amp;#39;s governing body &lt;a href=&quot;http://icann.org&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; will finally let you know which domain extensions made the cut. The application window closed yesterday and not surprisingly some entities already came forward with their TLD plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the companies which have announced TLDs in the last few days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radixregistry.com/radix-applies-for-31-strings-newgtlds.php&quot;&gt;Radix&lt;/a&gt; (31):
Indian-based Directi group plans to act as the registry of &lt;em&gt;.WEB, .SHOP, .BANK, .LAW, .MUSIC, .NEWS, .BLOG, .MOVIE, .BABY, .STORE, .DOCTOR, .HOTEL, .PLAY, .HOME, .SITE, .WEBSITE, .CLICK, .ONLINE, .ONE, .PING, .SPACE, .WORLD, .PRESS, .CHAT, .CITY, .DEALS, .INSURANCE, .LOANS, .APP, .HOST, .HOSTING&lt;/em&gt; and is quite open about the fact that it &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://domainincite.com/archives/9174-directi-expects-all-31-of-its-gtlds-to-be-contested&quot;&gt;might be contested by other companies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.com&quot;&gt;web.com&lt;/a&gt; who also submitted an application for a .web extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/expanding-internet-domain-space.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; (4):
Google will apply for their trademarks, i.e. &lt;em&gt;.GOOGLE&lt;/em&gt; as well as domains related to products like &lt;em&gt;.DOCS&lt;/em&gt; which is part of the Google Apps suite. They&amp;#39;re also planning extensions to improve the user experience such as &lt;em&gt;.YOUTUBE&lt;/em&gt; and creative ones, e.g. &lt;em&gt;.LOL&lt;/em&gt; for cat pictures (is there any other funny stuff on the web?). The internet giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://adage.com/article/digital/google-applies-50-domains-including-lol-youtube/235079/&quot;&gt;has applied for up to 50 domains&lt;/a&gt; in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.momentous.com/media/momentous-reveals-four-new-top-level-domains&quot;&gt;Momentous&lt;/a&gt; (4):
The Canadian company decided to submit applications for an interesting selection with &lt;em&gt;.DESIGN, .STYLE, .RIP, .SUCKS&lt;/em&gt; - with the latter certainly stirring some controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2012/05/30/go-daddy-applies-for-home-and-casa-top-level-domains/&quot;&gt;Go Daddy&lt;/a&gt; (3):
DNS industry behemoth Go Daddy revealed their plans for &lt;em&gt;.GODADDY, .HOME &amp;amp; .CASA&lt;/em&gt; which makes sense from a branding perspective and for end users to create their home on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2012/05/31/pir-ngo-domain-extension/&quot;&gt;PIR&lt;/a&gt; (2):
The Public Interest Registry (PIR) who is already managing the .ORG top-level domain wants to add &lt;em&gt;.NGO&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;.ONG&lt;/em&gt; to their portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aba.com&quot;&gt;American Bankers Association&lt;/a&gt; (2):
This group has applied for two the names &lt;em&gt;.BANK&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;.INSURANCE&lt;/em&gt; which will be restricted TLDs meaning registration will not be open to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudnames.com/&quot;&gt;CloudNames&lt;/a&gt; (2):
As the name would suggest one of the strings CloudNames has placed a bid for is &lt;em&gt;.CLOUD&lt;/em&gt; which &amp;quot;will allow businesses and individuals to have their own cloud on the Internet&amp;quot;. The second TLD is &lt;em&gt;.GLOBAL&lt;/em&gt; for international businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without doubt there will be more announcements before ICANN&amp;#39;s official statement in two weeks where hundreds of additional top-level domain extensions are expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which suffix is your favorite? What domains would you register? We&amp;#39;d love to see your suggestions in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Founders, Techies &amp; Creatives Anticipate Joyful June</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The chill of Winter may be upon us, but that&amp;#39;s no reason to despair. There&amp;#39;s an exciting collection of events lined up this month for founders, techies and other creative misfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love Google services then the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-GTUG/&quot;&gt;Auckland Google Technology User Group&lt;/a&gt; (GTUG) is the place for you. This meetup group has regular sessions on topics ranging from Android development to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;. Auckland also gets to enjoy another &lt;a href=&quot;http://auckland.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; this month at a new venue over the bridge at the Massey University campus in Albany. Expect 54 hours of start-up madness plus lots of great learning and networking. Tech founder Marie-Claire Andrews will be speaking about ShowGizmo at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/events/60395282/&quot;&gt;Wellington Hackers &amp;amp; Founders&lt;/a&gt; group this month. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.showgizmo.com/&quot;&gt;ShowGizmo&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/mobile/&quot;&gt;mobile app&lt;/a&gt; that aids knowledge networking at major conferences all over the world. As a New Zealand based, but global &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain registrar&lt;/a&gt; iWantMyName is very pleased to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackfund.me/&quot;&gt;sponsor&lt;/a&gt; of Hackers &amp;amp; Founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also great to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://bizdojo.com/&quot;&gt;Bizdojo&lt;/a&gt; supporting tech user groups in the community by offering a free venue for meetups. The newly formed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Data-Without-Borders-NZ/events/66909372/&quot;&gt;Data Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; group will convene at Bizdojo&amp;#39;s Wellington co-working space at the end of the month with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;our CTO&lt;/a&gt;. This event will interest data scientists, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;software developers&lt;/a&gt; and global thinkers. Last, but certainly not least, look out for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gathergather.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Gather Barcamp&lt;/a&gt; with an overflowing stack of local notables and a web and creative agenda made by you. Art, design, engineering and science, it&amp;#39;s a fantasmic lucky dip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we miss anything? If so, you will probably find it in the New Zealand &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupdigest.com/&quot;&gt;Startup Digest&lt;/a&gt;, a weekly compilation of all the coolest start-up, technology and innovation events.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>5 options to migrate your iWeb-created website from MobileMe to an alternative hosting provider</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-05-31-logo-mobileme.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-mobileme.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of MobileMe as you know it is near! While most services such as email, contacts or calendars found their way into iCloud, Apple will discontinue their iWeb publishing service on June 30th, 2012. This means your website created in iWeb will no longer work on Apple&amp;#39;s old MobileMe platform and it&amp;#39;s high time to switch to another hosting option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as your domain name is concerned, in most cases you can keep it with your current registrar. All you have to do is change the DNS settings or nameservers in your iWantMyName (or any other registrar&amp;#39;s) dashboard. For those of you currently using MobileMe&amp;#39;s free web address, e.g. web.me.com/username/sitename we highly recommend to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;register a domain name&lt;/a&gt;. A domain stays with you as long as you pay for it and you can switch from one provider to another without having to change your web address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 1: switch to a hosted website builder (recommended)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, move away from iWeb as your website creation software. This might sound difficult and definitely requires some work but now&amp;#39;s the time to do so because Apple will not release new versions of iWeb in the future. Many types of desktop applications have been moved into the cloud over the last few years and website builders are no exception. So if you want a solution that is future-proof, you should consider one of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;hosted site builder services&lt;/a&gt; which let you manage all aspects of your online presence over the internet. Using this option, you will not have to download and install any software meaning that you always have the latest version and features at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the easiest solution in terms of changing the DNS settings of your domain name. If your domain is managed by us, all you have to do is select the service of your choice from the iWantMyName marketplace within your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps&quot;&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions. For domains registered with another registrar, simply replace the MobileMe CNAME (web.me.com) with the DNS settings of your new sitebuilder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of our staff picks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jimdo.com&quot;&gt;Jimdo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimdo.com/wiki/Moving_From_iWeb_to_Jimdo&quot;&gt;MobileMe migration guide&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://weebly.com&quot;&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://virb.com&quot;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zoho.com/sites&quot;&gt;Zoho Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More hosting options can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;iWantMyName marketplace&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-05-31-website-builder-apps.png&quot; alt=&quot;website-builder-apps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 2: pick a new hosting provider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you have to stick with iWeb, the good news is that any hosting company offering you FTP access to their servers will work. That&amp;#39;s a pretty standard feature with all web hosting plans throughout the industry. However, there is one caveat when switching from MobileMe to standard web hosting and that is, you cannot use some Apple-specific features such as password protected pages, blog and photo comments or the visitor counter any longer. When choosing a new web host, don&amp;#39;t worry about fancy stuff, e.g. included databases or programming languages supported. The only important thing is to pick a plan offering sufficient storage space and bandwidth, depending on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23830?viewlocale=en_US&quot;&gt;size of your site created in iWeb&lt;/a&gt;. Since iWeb is creating static HTML pages, the most basic package should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://nearlyfreespeech.net&quot;&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech.NET&lt;/a&gt; as they will only charge you for disk space and bandwidth that you really use. If you want to learn more about using iWeb&amp;#39;s integrated FTP client, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwebfaq.org/site/iWeb_Folder_FTP.html&quot;&gt;this FAQ&lt;/a&gt; can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that using this option, you will most likely have to update the nameservers for your domain. This might require some additional planning if you&amp;#39;re using email services under your own domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nearlyfreespeech.net&quot;&gt;NearlyFreeSpeech.NET (pay-as-you-go hosting)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 3: choose a Mac-friendly hosting service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic has been covered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.macworld.com/article/1166270/switch_your_iweb_site_to_a_mac_friendly_web_host.html&quot;&gt;Macworld&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month and everything mentioned in the previous paragraph applies here as well. There are a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.machighway.com/mobileme.php&quot;&gt;Mac-friendly hosting providers&lt;/a&gt; and some even support certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ragesw.com/blog/2012/05/18/from-mobileme-to-rage-web-hosting-alternative-ways-to-retain-some-mobileme-features/&quot;&gt;MobileMe-specific features&lt;/a&gt;. A new company called MacMate &lt;a href=&quot;http://macmate.me&quot;&gt;specializes in replacing MobileMe&lt;/a&gt; and is also worth checking out if you&amp;#39;re looking for a new home for your iWeb site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.macworld.com/article/1166270/switch_your_iweb_site_to_a_mac_friendly_web_host.html&quot;&gt;Switch your iWeb site to a Mac-friendly Web host&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.machighway.com/mobileme.php&quot;&gt;MacHighway hosting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://macmate.me&quot;&gt;MacMate iWeb replacement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 4: use an alternative desktop app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWeb surely is a neat application but as outlined before, Apple stopped development and there will be no future versions. There have always been great desktop alternatives and here are the two most popular ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/overview/&quot;&gt;Rapidweaver&lt;/a&gt;: powerful web design software for your Mac for beginners and advanced users. Lots of add-ons and themes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karelia.com/sandvox&quot;&gt;Sandvox&lt;/a&gt;: you can try the software for free and the developers published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/from-iweb-to-sandvox.html&quot;&gt;guide for users switching from iWeb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both applications have a built-in FTP client and can be used with the hosting options mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 5: backup your site on DropBox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option should only be used as a last resort or backup solution but publishing your website on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is a free way to keep it online. However, there is a huge downside and that is the ugly and unmemorable web address. Sure, you could forward your domain name to the public Dropbox URL but it just looks unprofessional. Macworld has more information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.macworld.com/article/1166277/how_to_publish_your_mobileme_iweb_site_on_dropbox.html&quot;&gt;how to publish your site on Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need any help with changing your domain setup from MobileMe to one of the options above, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Free Zoho Sites Delivers Value On Custom Domain Setup</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-05-29-zohosites.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zohosites.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a long time coming but Zoho have finally added a website builder to their suite of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite&quot;&gt;hosted business services&lt;/a&gt;. Nimble Zoho already had a fantastic offering with useful cross-platform functionality that has been nibbling at the heels of arch-competitor &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; for years, but now the circle is complete - so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the dark ages there was a giant server farm called Geocities that allowed budding web geeks to build and post their own websites. Geocities&amp;#39; death warrant was written the moment Yahoo got involved, but not before millions of us got a taste for creating and building sites and communities online. All this, years before social networks came to the fore. Today, building a simple website is a breeze, with the plethora of hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;website builders&lt;/a&gt; that are now available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoho.com/sites/&quot;&gt;Zoho Sites&lt;/a&gt; are heavily promoting the fact that their site builder provides instant optimization for mobile users and integrates with existing (and future) Zoho business tools. This will be especially interesting for small businesses looking to capture, monetize and track the fast growing mobile market. The easy drag and drop format will also interest micro-business users who are generally time poor and want to get up and running quickly. At $39 for a whole year, the paid plan looks very attractively priced and Zoho scores extra points for excluding ads from its free version as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nj4qBd6vOpk&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding Zoho Sites to your domain name from the iWantMyName dashboard is really easy and requires zero technical knowledge. Purchase your own web address and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/register-domain-zoho-sites&quot;&gt;get started with your website today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Yahoo! It&#39;s Time For Hosted WebMail</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-05-18-stuffed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;stuffed.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 14/02/13&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xtra is finally reviewing its partnership with Yahoo. Given there are so many other better webmail offerings around these days, it was inevitable. Xtra&amp;#39;s latest problems with email simply underlines why we all need to take control of our virtual letterboxes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the unfortunate &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/yahoo-decline/&quot;&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt; of Yahoo and it&amp;#39;s no secret that the company has been dogged by &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.iitp.org.nz/newsletter/article/&quot;&gt;technological challenges&lt;/a&gt; and management unrest recently. All the more reason why Xtra customers should be concerned about being locked into a single service provider. Telecom cynically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4894091/Telecom-sells-YahooXtra-share&quot;&gt;flicked off&lt;/a&gt; its half of YahooXtra to Yahoo7 a couple of years ago, leaving Xtra customers in the lurch somewhat. Customer support around Yahoo mail has reportedly been patchy ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this strengthens the case for greater self-managment of your mail service. Rather then accepting a generic email address from your ISP, why not host your email on your own entirely portable domain? Fortunately there are a number of other excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting/&quot;&gt;hosted email solutions&lt;/a&gt; that are fully domain customisable with a single click of a button from within your iWantMyName dashboard. Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/233925-how-can-i-set-up-email-with-my-own-domain-&quot;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; about setting up email on your domain. Get cracking and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;register a personal domain&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Personal Domains Anchor Creative Customization</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It is always exciting to see domain names released into the wild and being put to good use. We&amp;#39;ve noticed that there is a burgeoning community of artists, designers and makers promoting their pet projects on the web these days. There&amp;#39;s also a growing number of attractively designed &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;hosted services&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/02/photo-hosting-service-500px-increases-exposure.html&quot;&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt; that make it really easy to create and domain customize an attractive art &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-05-16-reclaiming_value-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;reclaiming value-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some great examples of creative showcases. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reclaimingvalue.com/&quot;&gt;Reclaiming Value&lt;/a&gt; is a U.S. based site that sharpens our imagination by exposing the simplicity and beauty inherent within tastefully recycled objects. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anaisgato.com/&quot;&gt;Anais Gato&lt;/a&gt; is a freelance graphic designer from Barcelona who attracts new projects from all over Europe by posting examples of previous assignments on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://cargocollective.com/&quot;&gt;Cargo Collective&lt;/a&gt; site. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tessafox.com/&quot;&gt;Tessa Fox&lt;/a&gt; is a talented photo-journalist who covers the film and music scenes in both U.K. and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of interest in design and creativity is certainly happening at grassroots level, but the Internet is at the heart of a much broader cultural and creative shift taking place that will have global implications. For example, respected and influential media such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/node/21553017&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/11/3d-printing-autodesk/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; regularly publish articles talking about the coming revolution in distributed and additive manufacturing. It&amp;#39;s clear now that prophetic companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ponoko.com/&quot;&gt;Ponoko&lt;/a&gt; were onto something big when they got into remote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizmag.com/olaf-diegel-3d-printed-guitars/21787/&quot;&gt;3D manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; and began building an online community of designers and makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName makes it easy to domain customize your creative portfolio with a one-click DNS set-up on your domain. For more information or assistance with handling your domain set-up, please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.UK Available For 1 Year, .IO 2-Letter Domains &amp; May Promotions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The British registry &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nominet.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Nominet&lt;/a&gt; recently reduced the minimum registration period for all .UK domain extensions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.me.uk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;) to one year. As of today, any .UK domain purchase at iWantMyName will reflect this change and domains will be registered for one year only. The registration period of existing domains is not affected but subsequent renewals will occur on a yearly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

We now support &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;two-letter .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; for customized URL shortening or your next website or app. These super short web addresses are available at only $79.00 USD in the first year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other currently running promotions this month are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  $12.00 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Happy Birthday dotFM</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-04-30-radiodj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;radiodj.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top level domains may be on the way soon, but the dotFM registry was amongst the first to promote a country code domain (ccTLD) for wider commercial use. Fifteen years along the track, our domain DJ charts the progress of this ground-breaking registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.FM domain&lt;/a&gt; originated as a ccTLD allocated to the tiny Pacific Island chain of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), a self-governing state formerly under United States stewardship until independence in 1986. Being small and highly dispersed and with a population of just over 100,000 there was quite limited local demand for the domain, so a plan was devised whereby San Francisco based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brsmedia.fm/about_us.html&quot;&gt;BRS Media&lt;/a&gt; would market .FM to the global online media industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain obviously offers the perfect home for anyone involved with Internet radio; but .FM has also been adopted widely by businesses and individuals from across the broader media, entertainment and music industry. Included amongst the more notable users are music recommendation sites &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/&quot;&gt;Last FM&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://blip.fm/&quot;&gt; BlipFM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://turntable.fm/&quot;&gt;Turntable FM&lt;/a&gt; as well as popular regional radio channels such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jazz.fm/&quot;&gt;Jazz FM&lt;/a&gt;. Newly launched Official FM is the latest aspirant with its attractive offering being &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/23/official-fm-launches-its-new-music-promotion-platform/&quot;&gt;featured in TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; recently. With hundreds of millions of Internet radio listeners tuning in globally, BRS are now also pitching to deliver .RADIO, one of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/new-top-level-domain-extensions-are-coming.html&quot;&gt;new TLDs&lt;/a&gt; off the block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName is promoting .FM domains at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;special price&lt;/a&gt; of $85.00 this month.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Eyebrows Raised As CISPA Rolls Forward</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Internet commentators were in a flap today and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3896492&quot;&gt;tech forums&lt;/a&gt; abuzz as it was revealed the U.S. House of Representatives &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57422567-281/house-approves-cispa-despite-last-minute-push-by-opponents/&quot;&gt;voted in favor of the CISPA Act&lt;/a&gt;. Seems like there is no let up in the barrage of legislation designed to afford greater &amp;quot;protection&amp;quot; for individuals and corporations that use or abuse the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;yber &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ntelligence &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;haring and &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rotection &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ct ostensibly facilitates the voluntary sharing of information between U.S. 
government agencies and private companies 
to defend against external attacks on networks. It amends some tired laws that date back over sixty years in some cases. Whilst most people agree that the cyber threats mentioned in the bill do exist, there is disagreement over whether such legislation would be effective at all. Critics of the bill also worry that it legalizes information sharing that could impact on privacy, under the guise of ensuring security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama is reportedly unimpressed by the current version of CISPA as well and alluded to the possibility of a Presidential Veto despite the fact some of the most intrusive aspects of the bill were toned down considerably before it was approved. A few original supporters of the bill were left in a quandry as they struggled to balance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/cispa-national-security-and-nsa-ability-read-your-emails&quot;&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; against the very real need to mitigate against cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far the bill actually proceeds is still uncertain; but after last year&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/01/sopa-blackout.html&quot;&gt;SOPA debacle&lt;/a&gt; it once again raises the spectre of a hurriedly written law that has huge implications for corporations and individuals and about which most citizens have had little or no prior information. But with the Presidential election looming and other competing bills on the Senate agenda it may be a long time before CISPA sees the light of day. In the meantime voters have the opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;http://paidcontent.org/2012/04/26/faq-what-you-need-to-know-about-fridays-cispa-vote/&quot;&gt;get informed&lt;/a&gt; about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>WDCNZ Boldly Goes Forth</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-04-24-wdcnz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wdcnz.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Wellington is the centre of the digital creative universe, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://wdcnz.com/&quot;&gt;WDCNZ&lt;/a&gt;  must surely be the natural focus point for the New Zealand web &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;software developer&lt;/a&gt; community. And since iWantMyName is simply the coolest &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain management&lt;/a&gt; service in the galaxy (and also based in the Capital) then it follows we&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;jump at light speed&amp;quot; for the chance to get involved, right? You bet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WDCNZ explodes onto your screens again this August and will be even bigger and better then before. Being all about the real nuts and bolts technical knowledge that keeps the web humming, we&amp;#39;re really chuffed to be a leading sponsor. Web Dev Con has some pretty amazing speakers lined up this year too, including local luminaries Vaughan Rowsell of &lt;a href=&quot;http://evanhugh.com/2011/08/10/vendhq-banks-funding-round/&quot;&gt;VendHQ&lt;/a&gt; fame, Aaron Morton and Silverstripe CTO Hamish Friedlander plus a very sharp looking contingent from offshore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reckon &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/https://wdcnz-2012.lilregie.com/step1&quot;&gt;tickets&lt;/a&gt; will fly out the door, so don&amp;#39;t muck around. You&amp;#39;d be &amp;quot;warped&amp;quot; not to be there. Oh yes...keep an eye on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; for updates on special offers and meetups related to this event.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sharing Easter Fun Online</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-04-06-egg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;egg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Easter time. For some people this means chocolate confectionery, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_roll&quot;&gt;egg rolling&lt;/a&gt; and a curiously wet tradition called &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodgrape.com/index.php/articles/comments/oh_dyngus_day_and_drinking_with_the_prez/&quot;&gt;Dyngus Day&lt;/a&gt;. For others it&amp;#39;s a time of religious reflection. However you celebrate Easter, there&amp;#39;s sure to be fun with friends and family and probably some amusing photos and stories to tell. It&amp;#39;s a great time to begin or update your blog or image portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your friends may be flocking to Facebook, but let&amp;#39;s face it, there&amp;#39;s nothing interesting about its dull, corporate, cookie-cutter approach to online content sharing. If you want something a little more personal, there&amp;#39;s now a wide range of hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blog services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/&quot;&gt;portfolio apps&lt;/a&gt; available to help you express your creativity - and we&amp;#39;re making &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/14-new-hosting-services-applications-for-your-domains.html&quot;&gt;new additions&lt;/a&gt; to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, you can easily domain customize most of these services with a single click from within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; dashboard. Don&amp;#39;t be left with egg on your face this weekend. Get hopping and start your own personal abode on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>5 New Country Codes: .PM, .RE, .TF, .WF &amp; .YT Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-03-31-afnic-tlds.png&quot; alt=&quot;afnic-tlds.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we have added five new country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) for you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;register at iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;. The domain extensions &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pm-domain-name-registration-for-saint-pierre-and-miquelon&quot;&gt;.PM (St Pierre et Miquelon)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/re-french-domain-name-registration-for-reunion&quot;&gt;.RE (Réunion)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tf-domain-name-registration-for-french-southern-territories&quot;&gt;.TF (French Southern Territories)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/wf-wallisian-futunan-domain-name-registration-for-wallis-and-futuna&quot;&gt;.WF (Wallis and Futuna)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/yt-mahoran-domain-name-registration-for-mayotte&quot;&gt;.YT (Mayotte)&lt;/a&gt; belong to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and are managed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://afnic.fr&quot;&gt;AFNIC&lt;/a&gt;, the French registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.PM, .RE, .TF, .WF and .YT domains can be registered by anybody worldwide at a yearly price of $49.00 which includes the required local address in the European Union. We also offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain transfers in these French extensions&lt;/a&gt; without you losing any previously paid term at your current registrar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Need help with moving your domain names? Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;free managed transfer service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Codemaniacs Of The World Unite</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-03-30-meetup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;meetup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codemania.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Codemania&lt;/a&gt; was very likely the coolest
tech conference to hit Auckland in a long time, so it was a pleasure
to be able to host an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/03/hola-codemania-meetup.html&quot;&gt;iWantMyName drinks meet-up&lt;/a&gt; for delegates the evening before
the main event. Judging by the contented faces, the hospitality was well
received, especially by those who (like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iWantMyName team&lt;/a&gt;) were coming from out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t seem to matter if you were a Sharepoint fan or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/open-source/&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; advocate, we all agreed that good beer tastes even better when imbibed over a conversation with a fellow start-up techie or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;software developer&lt;/a&gt;. Platform agnosticism aside, Codemania put on a wonderfully diverse show by all accounts and we are guessing that a bigger venue may well be on the cards for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&quot;&gt;software community&lt;/a&gt;
 both here and abroad is part of our underlying philosophy, mostly 
because we love hearing your thoughts about how we can improve and grow.
 iWantMyName is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;global domain management&lt;/a&gt; service with a predominantly 
offshore customer base and hence we are doing our small part to take 
Kiwi technology to the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to head honchos Ben Gracewood and Ian Randall for organising Codemania and for letting delegates know about the meet-up and also Dan Khan for sharing with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/auckland-tech-startups/&quot;&gt;Tech Startups&lt;/a&gt; followers in Auckland. Cheers to the friendly crew at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thebluestoneroom.co.nz/&quot;&gt;The Bluestone Room&lt;/a&gt; for taking good care of and us keeping the cervezas flowing. We certainly hope to put on a repeat performance next year.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bubble And Squeak Kids Fashion Fry-Up</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-03-16-cute.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cute.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing a little tired of cookie cutter, mass produced clothing lines for kids? Our domain of the month might have the answer for you. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kidsclothesonline.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Bubble and Squeak&lt;/a&gt; offers online retailing for fun and funky childrenswear at affordable price points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kid has moved on to a school uniform now, but I can still remember what a drag it was trying to find fashionable and individual styles to bundle him in when he was an active toddler. These days clothing manufacturers&amp;#39; colour pallette seems to be limited to pastel shades of blue and pink. Bubble and Squeak in-house designs have a lot more imagination than that and they limit each production run to 50 stock items in each size range. So you won&amp;#39;t run into a kiddie clone on your next outing to the mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bubble and Squeak&amp;#39;s e-tailing site is also a great example of how to set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;domain customised Shopify&lt;/a&gt; store front on the web. Shopify walks you through building your online marketplace, but you can also engage a friendly developer/designer to give it that extra special flavour. Bubble and Squeak has the highly sought after web development team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uprise.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Uprise&lt;/a&gt; to thank for tailoring their website to best promote these smart sartorial offerings to busy Mums and Dads online.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Hola! Codemania Meetup</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-03-08-codemania.png&quot; alt=&quot;codemania.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hay Carramba! &lt;a href=&quot;http://codemania.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Codemania&lt;/a&gt; is storming into town and guess who&amp;#39;s riding shotgun with the unofficial official &lt;a href=&quot;http://twtvite.com/iwantmyname-codemania&quot;&gt;pre-event party&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;5pm on&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Thursday 29th March&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nacho Libre themed, platform agnostic software conference for developers opens the following day with a huge range of expert speakers and tech talks programmed. If you plan to arrive in town the evening before, feel free to head along to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://twtvite.com/iwantmyname-codemania&quot;&gt;welcome drinks&lt;/a&gt; being held in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/auckland-tech-startups/&quot;&gt;Auckland Tech Startups Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve also got one or two of the Codemania guest speakers plus the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iWantMyName team&lt;/a&gt; showing up to take the bull by the horns, so come along and chat to them in a relaxed setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Meetup is open to any web or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;software developers&lt;/a&gt; generally and of course all the hard working tech start-up folks from around the City of Sails. Naturally, we&amp;#39;ll be shouting a round of Cervezas and Margaritas to warm things up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can sign up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/auckland-tech-startups/&quot;&gt;Auckland Tech Startups Meetup&lt;/a&gt; group site or on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twtvite.com/iwantmyname-codemania&quot;&gt;this Twtvite page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Care For Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Updates?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days we had some requests for a simple API that allows DNS updates for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;domains&lt;/a&gt; from the console or from within a script. We really wanted this for a long time too so I sat down and looked around for standards already in use. The de-facto standard for these sorts of updates seems to be DDNS -- used widely by DynDNS -- which is supported by many routers out of the box. We sat down and wrote a DDNS implementation for iWantMyName and you can use it right away. No configuration needed, no special stuff to set up, just start using it. The call looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;curl -u &amp;quot;[username]:[password]&amp;quot; \
  &amp;quot;https://iwantmyname.com/basicauth/ddns?hostname=[hostname1]&amp;amp;myip=[IP]&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be more than one hostname in the update call (separated by commas) and hostnames that don&amp;#39;t exist yet will be created implicitly. Please keep in mind that DNS will be cached. In order to find out what records are currently set for your domain, just ask our nameservers directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;dig @ns1.iwantmyname.net [hostname]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will return the current DNS settings for the hostname that our authoritative nameservers have. If you want to check the IP addresses various resolvers around the world know of, try the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatsmydns.net/&quot;&gt;DNS check tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to feedback from our users we made our DDNS service even more useful. The &amp;quot;myip&amp;quot; parameter is now optional and gets automagically filled with the remote IP if not provided. This makes it even easier if you use this with a dynamic address as you can skip the step where you try to figure out your own address.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.CO Domain - What Will You Build?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-02-29-dotco.png&quot; alt=&quot;dotco.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO domain&lt;/a&gt; launched at the end of 2009 and after only 18 months had already built a customer base of over 1 million registrations. That&amp;#39;s astounding growth by any standard. But it&amp;#39;s not all one way traffic for the perky upstart. The .CO registry is firmly focused on reaching out to and supporting entrepreneurs because it wants to be the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM domain&lt;/a&gt; for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.CO is in fact the country code top level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Colombia. But the government of the South American nation handed over management of the domain to a joint venture company based in the United States. The company has backing from Neustar, one of the most experienced global registry technology providers ensuring that customers can have confidence in the security of their domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently a great campaign underway &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.go.co/case-studies/underthebulb/&quot;&gt;showcasing young entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; that picked up .CO for their business domain and it tells the unique stories of how they dreamed up their .COOL idea. Those young business people are in good company. Some of the hottest technology companies in America are already using the .CO domain, including Twitter, 500 Startups and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;#39;t resist joining the party too. So if you have a brilliant business idea and want to find your own fantastic .CO domain, simply hop over to our domain search page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://iwantmyname.co/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Price Reduction For .CZ, .ES, .FR, .LU &amp; .LT Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re constantly reviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;our top-level domain range&lt;/a&gt; to offer you the best domain and DNS management experience at affordable rates. Our philosophy is to reduce prices as we grow and pass on any savings we receive from registries or suppliers. That&amp;#39;s why you can now enjoy cheaper domain registration for the following domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  .&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cz-czech-domain-name-registration-for-czech-republic&quot;&gt;CZ domains&lt;/a&gt;: $35 → $30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;.FR domains&lt;/a&gt;: $70 → $50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;.ES domains&lt;/a&gt;: $35 → $25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lt-lithuanian-domain-name-registration-for-lithuania&quot;&gt;.LT domains&lt;/a&gt;: $35 → $30&lt;/li&gt;

This is a permanent price reduction for new domains and subsequent renewals.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>WordPress Developers Get Your Blogs On</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-02-24-wp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wp.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost a decade of development, WordPress has steadily evolved from being a slightly clunky system for blogging enthusiasts into a mature, widely used content management system deployed with well over &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wordpress.com/stats/&quot;&gt;70 million sites&lt;/a&gt; globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word Camps are leading the charge in championing the product around the world and New Zealand is no exception. Plans are well underway for the next local event. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcamp.org.nz/&quot;&gt;WordCamp NZ&lt;/a&gt; just keeps getting better each year and the aim is to bring Kiwi WordPress fans together for some inspiring talks and updates on where the platform is heading.

				<title>How A Personal Website Can Boost Your Business</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest post by Per Schmitz -- Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dooid.com&quot;&gt;DooID&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-02-23-logo-profile-dooid.png&quot; alt=&quot;DooID&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://dooid.com&quot;&gt;DooID&lt;/a&gt; we focus on developing an outstanding platform for simple and clean personal websites. Our aim is to help you build an effective tool that will enhance your accessibility and promote your personal brand, in a painless, easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personal website will help you to connect with clients on a very emotional level, as you don&amp;#39;t only display the professional aspects of your life, but also give insights into who you are, your interests and visions. This emotional link will help to build trust and a deeper personal relationship with your audience. Emotions are a very subjective component of every sales process, but none the less weight heavily when taking decisions. At the same time your personal website displays all your on- and offline contact data. Unlike on a paper business card, virtually displayed contact data can easily be kept up-to-date and can showcase everything from your social media links to phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point people to one simple place where they can find your complete range of communication options, and can easily choose which way is the most comfortable for them to contact you. DooID allows to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/dooid-on-your-domain&quot;&gt;use your own domain name&lt;/a&gt; with the created personal website, which is a big advantage and adds professionalism when using your site for business purposes. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/08/5-domain-extensions-for-your-personal-website.html&quot;&gt;personal domain name&lt;/a&gt; like &amp;quot;yourname.me&amp;quot; will make your site easier to remember and look more professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just teamed up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dooid.com&quot;&gt;DooID&lt;/a&gt; to help you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/dooid-on-your-domain&quot;&gt;set up your new domain and add it to your DooID site&lt;/a&gt; with one click -- without any technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Photo Hosting Service 500px Increases Exposure</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-02-16-500px.png&quot; alt=&quot;500px.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often we come across a web app that simply blows our socks off. &lt;a href=&quot;http://500px.com/&quot;&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt; is one such. It&amp;#39;s a portfolio offering for photographers that is jam packed full of absolutely gorgeous images. Of course we simply had to add it to our recommendation list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;hosted services&lt;/a&gt; and it has been great to see users taking early advantage of our easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio/500px-custom-domain-registration&quot;&gt;domain customization facility for 500px&lt;/a&gt; portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;500px is a community and a meritocracy as well, so the most popular shots get featured and promoted on the site. They also upgraded their &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/500px/id471965292?mt=8&quot;&gt;iPad App&lt;/a&gt; recently which is proving to be popular. The site has frequently been described as a Flickr killer, but there really is no comparison. 500px is squarely aimed at professional or more serious amateur photographers. So you won&amp;#39;t find yourself overwhelmed by pics of kittens and cute babies. This is serious content from dedicated, creative and hard working photographers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell these guys are serious about promoting their craft. The 500px app has now been optimized to deliver a better experience across all mobile platforms and they also built a nifty plug-in that allows pros to export image files directly from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/&quot;&gt;Adobe Lightroom&lt;/a&gt;. No doubt other enhancements are in the pipeline. In the same way that Instagram is revolutionizing mobile image sharing and with a reputed 8 million plus visitors daily, 500px looks unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Christchurch Startup Weekend Warm Up</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-02-09-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitement is mounting as &lt;a href=&quot;http://christchurch.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Christchurch Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; draws closer. Once again we are looking forward to supporting the event, which kicks off on Friday, February 24th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host city is about to embark on a rebirth of sorts after suffering an unprecedented series of devastating earthquakes that left the business district and many suburbs shattered and residents in shock. Building personal networks and cultivating a sense of hope through new entrepreneurship are two great ways to boost economic opportunities in the city - and Startup Weekend delivers admirably on both fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve had &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/11/usnapus-snaps-up-startup-weekend-prize.html&quot;&gt;loads of fun&lt;/a&gt; at previous Startup Weekends around New Zealand and through these events have been providing mentorship and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html&quot;&gt;start-up advice&lt;/a&gt; to young tech entrepreneurs as well as giving away free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain registrations&lt;/a&gt; to all the teams involved. Some of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;crew members&lt;/a&gt; will be in Christchurch, so look out for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; banner or let the organisers know if you need a domain for your brilliant Christchurch Startup Weekend project. We also recommend a bunch of cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;domain customisable developer apps&lt;/a&gt; that are great for getting you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from enjoying ourselves immensely, engaging with events like Startup Weekend is part of our drive to get closer to our customers in the developer community. Good start-ups learn lessons from their users, so we love getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; (good or bad) as we evolve iWantMyName to meet your needs better. It&amp;#39;s not too late to &lt;a href=&quot;http://christchurch.startupweekend.org/tickets/&quot;&gt;grab a ticket&lt;/a&gt; for this southern Startup Weekend. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Digesting An Eventful Month</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;February is shaping up as an inspiring month on the start-up, technology and innovation event calendar throughout New Zealand, illustrating that our tech scene is alive and well and continuing to grow. Here&amp;#39;s a quick summary of what&amp;#39;s on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The busy month kicks off with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/playmaker/&quot;&gt;Game Developers Meetup&lt;/a&gt; in Auckland organised by &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://playmaker.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Playmaker&lt;/a&gt; the proactive community for independent games developers. Main topic of conversation will involve finding out about all the cool games built during Global Game Jam. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/11/rails-camp-on-track.html&quot;&gt;Rails Camp&lt;/a&gt; weekend is underway from 10th February with Ruby on Rails fans heading up to Mt. Cheeseman in Canterbury for their annual bush bash. The week of 13-17th Feb is reserved for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstock.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Webstock&lt;/a&gt; so the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iWantMyName crew&lt;/a&gt; will definitely be wandering over to the Wellington Town Hall to see who&amp;#39;s rocking the world of web design and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following week the tables will be turned and it will be us in the limelight. We&amp;#39;re shouting a few beers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/events/tech_founder_blast_talks&quot;&gt;Unlimited Potential&amp;#39;s Tech Founder Blast Talks&lt;/a&gt; and our CTO will also be speaking. Blast Talks looks like a big night out with some of Wellington&amp;#39;s leading developers and tech company founders on hand. We are also getting right behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://christchurch.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Christchurch Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt;, which launches on the weekend of 24th February. One or two of us will be on hand to provide some free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt; and offer coaching to help project teams get off to a good start. It&amp;#39;s a small contribution we can make towards encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit to rise once again in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep in touch with these events and many others, &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupdigest.com/subscribe/&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to the New Zealand edition of Startup Digest.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New: .EC Domains From Ecuador</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-ecuadorian-domain-name-registration-for-ecuador&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-01-30-Ecuador-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ecuador Domain Name&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now register the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-ecuadorian-domain-name-registration-for-ecuador&quot;&gt;.EC domain extension&lt;/a&gt; from the Republic of Ecuador. After .CO (Colombia) and .PE (Peru), it is the third TLD (top-level domain) from the northwest of South America in our ever growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;list of domains&lt;/a&gt; at iWantMyName.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the .EC web address is mainly used within the country itself, registration is open for businesses, organizations and private persons worldwide. This makes .EC an attractive domain for URL shorteners or vanity domains. New registrations and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-domain-registrar-transfer-ecuador&quot;&gt;transfers for the Ecudorian TLD&lt;/a&gt; are available at an introductory price of $79.00 USD. Get started and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-ecuadorian-domain-name-registration-for-ecuador&quot;&gt;purchase your own .EC domain name today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iWantMyName Applauds Startup Alley Finalists</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-01-26-webstock.png&quot; alt=&quot;webstock.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstock.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Webstock&lt;/a&gt; is a world class web usability and design conference being held right here in our own back yard. This year Kiwi web companies attending the event are getting a leg up through an initiative called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstock.org.nz/12/bnz-startup-alley.php&quot;&gt;Startup Alley&lt;/a&gt; which is generously offering return flights to San Francisco and a short residency at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.klp.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Kiwi Landing Pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.webstock.org.nz/blog/2012/the-bnz-start-up-alley-finalists/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the six tech company finalists underlined what we already suspected. Pretty much all the coolest &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/11/usnapus-snaps-up-startup-weekend-prize.html&quot;&gt;emerging tech companies&lt;/a&gt; around are switching on to iWantMyName for easy and secure domain and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/simplify-your-domain-dns-management.html&quot;&gt;DNS management&lt;/a&gt; services. That&amp;#39;s a testament to our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&quot;&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; to supporting the web start-up community in New Zealand and an acknowledgement that we are delivering a refreshing service offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the finalists, best of luck for the Startup Alley pitching session at Webstock and we look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Domain For Chinese New Year</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-01-26-dragon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dragon&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week sees the start of the Chinese or Lunar New Year with 2012 being a &amp;quot;most auspicious&amp;quot; year of the dragon. There&amp;#39;s no denying that China remains an economic juggernaut and despite the uncertain global economic outlook, growth is expected to exceed 8% this year. So what is the best way for companies trading there to build a secure web profile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two considerations for businesses wishing to set up a web presence in China or other Chinese speaking markets. Firstly, what are safe domains to use? The .cn domain is a well established domain with over 3 million (mostly domestic) users, but which is under the strict control of the government Information Ministry. We have chosen not to offer the .cn domain at this time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies outside China however are making use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia&quot;&gt;.asia domain&lt;/a&gt; which is a completely independent domain that became available in 2008 and has almost 200,000 registrants around the Asia-Pacific region. Because .asia is a relatively young registry, there remains the opportunity to secure some good quality domains. Another U.S. based registry that we recommend is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&quot;&gt;cn.com domain&lt;/a&gt; which we are currently offering at a huge discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second consideration is language. Internationalized domain names (IDN) have arrived and you can now have your favorite domain in non-Latin scripts - example &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=%E5%B9%B8%E8%BF%90%E7%9A%84%E7%BA%A2%E9%BE%99.com&quot;&gt;幸运的红龙.com&lt;/a&gt;. IDNs are available across a limited (but growing) number of the most popular registries. If you have a non-English brand name that you wish to promote, this is a great way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Blackout Sheds Light On SOPA Madness</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-01-18-stop.png&quot; alt=&quot;stop.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by major Internet sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, January 18th is now shaping up as a major online protest event aimed at raising public awareness regarding the highly controversial Stop Online Piracy (SOPA) bill that is before the U.S. congress at present. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enacting SOPA in its current form will undoubtedly have major implications for Internet companies globally. It could also potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/10/sopa-hollywood-finally-gets-chance-break-internet&quot;&gt;crush freedom and innovation&lt;/a&gt; on the Web through draconian measures designed to promote a &amp;quot;shoot first, ask questions later&amp;quot; approach to addressing content piracy. That is why we recently invited domain owners to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/make-a-move-for-good.html&quot;&gt;Make A Move For Good&lt;/a&gt; away from fat cat companies that were backing SOPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer backlash against SOPA stopped some of its corporate sponsors dead in their tracks, proving that Internet activism really can make a difference. But the war is not yet won. In fact it is feared that supporters of the bill such as media dinosaur Rupert Murdoch and his powerful friends in the motion picture industry are scrambling to mount an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/17/stop-sopa-or-web-will-go-dark&quot;&gt;orchestrated&lt;/a&gt; counter-attack. It is important to show that we don&amp;#39;t want an Internet censored by governments at the behest of corporate lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can show your support for the blackout in many ways. Firstly (and most importantly) blog about it and share opinions and discussion widely through social media as well as offline. Secondly, you may wish to add an image to your site supporting the protest. Our friends over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-accelerator/torbit&quot;&gt;web optimizer Torbit&lt;/a&gt; have created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torbit.com/blog/2012/01/15/stop-sopa-js/&quot;&gt;nifty Javascript popup&lt;/a&gt; that does exactly that. Be informed and keep on fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dot Kiwi Domain Takes Flight</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-01-18-DotKiwi-Logo-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DotKiwi-Logo-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vancouver based ex-pat New Zealander Tim Johnson wanted to do something to help out his quake damaged hometown of Christchurch, so he set up a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://dot-kiwi.com/&quot;&gt;Dot Kiwi&lt;/a&gt; to create and administer a new domain name. Appropriately, a portion of the profit from sales of the proposed .kiwi domain will be earmarked for the Christchurch recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dotkiwi&quot;&gt;.kiwi domain&lt;/a&gt; proposal has been made possible by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html&quot;&gt;last year&amp;#39;s policy changes&lt;/a&gt; within Internet governance body ICANN that cleared the way for the development of more Internet real estate in the form of new generic top level domains (gTLDs). Dot Kiwi is well positioned to address the technical and legal challenges involved, having &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keanewzealand.com/wcnz&quot;&gt;KEA World Class New Zealander&lt;/a&gt; and immediate past Chairman of ICANN, Peter Dengate-Thrush on board as a director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Johnson, who has a background in software development and technology business management, was at the forefront of efforts to rally Canada-based New Zealanders in the wake of the Christchurch quake disaster. In his role as CEO of Dot Kiwi, Johnson sees a bright future for the new domain, which he expects to complete initial regulatory hurdles around early 2013. With over a million Kiwi ex-pats abroad the .kiwi domain obviously lends itself to individuals or businesses who want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;create a unique online profile&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. &amp;quot;We also think .kiwi will redefine the domain name market in New Zealand and lead to a wave of innovation in new services and applications&amp;quot;, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to be notified just as soon as .kiwi becomes available? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dotkiwi&quot;&gt;Leave your contact emai&lt;/a&gt;l here with us and we will keep you informed of developments.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Welcome 2012, And A Thank You To All Our Customers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2012-01-06-fireworks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fireworks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wilkommen Bienvenido 欢迎光临  Kia Ora Velkommen Namastey Добро пожаловать Selamat Datang Bienvenue Welcome!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a busy New Year period, iWantMyName welcomes all new customers and recent arrivals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; ended with some political fireworks in the domain industry as the world&amp;#39;s largest domain registrar attempted to recover from the crisis arising from its support of the misguided &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/make-a-move-for-good.html&quot;&gt;SOPA legislation&lt;/a&gt;. For many registrants it was the last straw after years of poor service and painful image blunders. The result was a flood of customers initiating &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; in protest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a relatively new player in the market (3 years now!) we were thrilled to see lots of enthusiastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt; flying around the Interwebs, with our existing customers heartily recommending iWantMyName to their friends. We even got a mention in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2011/12/29/how-to-move-your-domain-name-account/&quot;&gt;Mashable&amp;#39;s article&lt;/a&gt; detailing how to move your domains - a nice acknowledgement. So, thanks everyone for your continued support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we&amp;#39;ve got big plans with new additions to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;app marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, improvements to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/new-faster-domain-search.html&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; functionality and some feature redesigns as we look towards the introduction of new generic top level domains. Onwards and upwards into 2012!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Year For The People</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-31-demo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;demo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a remarkable year in many respects with a continuing catalogue of financial, political and environmental upheavals that affected both New Zealand and many other nations across the planet. However, it has been both inspiring and satisfying to witness the extent to which the Internet played a significant role in the human responses to such challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as Kiwis were sitting down for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/a-christmas-mission.html&quot;&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; dinner a wave of consumer activism was spreading around the world in response to the proposed SOPA bill in the United States which proposes far reaching reforms in an effort to counter intellectual property piracy. The much criticised bill seeks to protect digital rights for artists, but ironically imposes a burden on all Internet companies that enable the creation, sharing and hosting of online content. That&amp;#39;s a situation which New Zealanders already have some familiarity with when we think about the impact of the so-called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://3strikes.net.nz/&quot;&gt;Three Strikes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; legislation enacted here this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global Internet community was stunned to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/godaddys_sopa_support_sparks_calls_for_boycotts_an.php&quot;&gt;learn the names&lt;/a&gt; of some of the large technology corporations that were backing the bill, including the world&amp;#39;s largest domain registrar, and a rallying cry went out to support a consumer boycott. For many it was the last straw as dissatisfaction with that company had been growing for some time. Consequently we&amp;#39;ve set up a service to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; easy over the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some commentators questioning whether or not a protest would be meaningful, the boycott appears to have made some major tech businesses sit up and take notice. With Sony, EA and Nintendo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-largest-game-companies-in-the-world-have-dropped-their-support-for-a-bill-the-internet-hates-2011-12&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; back-peddling on supporting SOPA in its current form it seems like the business world has been forced to think more seriously about the wider implications in terms of how the bill affects Internet freedom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there were far more dramatic cases of Internet activism in 2011, with corrupt regimes dropping like dead flies as social media fueled protest drew thousands of disaffected citizens onto the streets. 2012 will no doubt continue to illustrate why we need a free and open Internet unfettered by governments and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year and Best Wishes for 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Helping Hand For Domain Transfers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-29-robot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Domain Robot&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ve decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/make-a-move-for-good.html&quot;&gt;join the movement&lt;/a&gt; against your old fashioned, SOPA-loving (or not loving, or maybe loving), redneck domain registrar &amp;mdash; but are not quite sure how to transfer your precious domains. Never fear, we&amp;#39;ve created a special &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;automatic domain transfer service&lt;/a&gt; just for you. iWantMyName aims to make domain management painless, simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;fill out the form&lt;/a&gt; and let us deal with all the messy details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately transferring a domain from one registrar to another is not always a straightforward exercise. However, our team of industry veterans are expert in untangling red tape and solving life&amp;#39;s little administrative problems. Provided you are willing to supply us with access to your existing account, we can handle everything for you. That leaves you more time to spend enjoying your holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do for you? First we will send you a quote for the cost of transfer (you get a 12 month extension with each transfer). Once you agree to the quote, we contact your existing registrar and gain all the required codes and permissions to make the transfer of your domains. Of course we will also migrate any DNS settings, so you get a completely seamless changeover. We&amp;#39;ve included a detailed FAQ on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;domain transfer page&lt;/a&gt; in case you have any questions or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, at iWantMyName we will never try to up-sell you with stuff you don&amp;#39;t need, plus we make domain and DNS management a breeze with our clean dashboard and simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;one-click DNS set-up&lt;/a&gt; on your favourite hosted apps.

				<title>Make A Move For Good</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re starting a movement and here&amp;#39;s why.
Recently you may have become aware of a list of corporations that are supporting the so called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act&quot;&gt;SOPA legislation&lt;/a&gt;. SOPA proposes much stronger responses for countering illicit trade in intellectual property, including far reaching measures that could impact a wide range of online service providers and indeed disrupt the safety and trust within the entire domain name system. We&amp;#39;ve been following the debate around SOPA from here in New Zealand, because it also potentially impacts on global Internet companies like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists, developers and other creatives certainly have a right to be fairly remunerated for their work. But the SOPA legislation, in its current form, has huge negative implications for digital innovation and personal freedoms globally. The Internet evolved largely on the basis of trust and openness and we get nervous when governments and corporations make up more rules that threaten those freedoms. If 2011 taught us nothing else, it was that the Internet has become the global vanguard of social democracy and a force for good. Let&amp;#39;s not give up those rights without a struggle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of good people are voting with their feet now and saying hey we don&amp;#39;t want to support big companies that are against Internet freedom. It&amp;#39;s hard to believe that any company would undermine the very industry that it purports to enable - but it seems to be the case. So if you have strong views on this topic and you are thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transferring your domain&lt;/a&gt; portfolio to a company that respects Internet freedom and opposes censorship, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;we&amp;#39;d love to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: In case you need a hand making a domain transfer, we&amp;#39;ve set up a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&quot;&gt;domain concierge&lt;/a&gt; service to alleviate any hassles.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Christmas Mission</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-22-pohu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pohu.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it&amp;#39;s that time of year once again when both credit card limits and shoppers&amp;#39; good humour are stretched to breaking point. Are you dreading your next excursion to the overcrowded shopping mall? No fear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing trend towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting/&quot;&gt;online shopping&lt;/a&gt; helps avoid long checkout queues and gives you better control over budgets, from the comfort of your lounge settee. In fact this year we&amp;#39;ve even &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/a-christmas-cracker.html&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; some cool Kiwi online games companies to our United States customers in search of unique gifts for their kids. Have you thought about giving a domain name as a pressie? We recently had a customer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address&quot;&gt;build and domain customise a Weebly website&lt;/a&gt; to give away as a clever Christmas gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s not forget what the true spirit of Christmas is all about. After a very busy and eventful &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; we should all take time to reflect on our blessings and spare a thought for others who are less fortunate. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellingtoncitymission.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Wellington City Mission&lt;/a&gt; is an iconic and much loved institution that assists many people in need, especially at this time of year. From food banks to mission for elderly programmes, the City Mission does a power of good across society working with lonely, hungry or displaced people that need a helping hand. It&amp;#39;s very easy to get caught up in the commercial hoop-la associated with Christmastime. But for a meaningful gift, why not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wellingtoncitymission.org.nz/public/help-us&quot;&gt;donate to the City Mission&lt;/a&gt; or another caring charity in your area?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a Safe and Enjoyable Festive Holiday Everyone!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Christmas Cracker</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-16-blog-christmas-santa.png&quot; alt=&quot;blog-christmas-santa.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/the-domain-name-year-2011-highlights.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; is already drawing to a close and even if you don&amp;#39;t celebrate Christmas in your household, you are probably finding yourself swept up in the &amp;quot;spirit of Christmas&amp;quot; as we stumble headlong towards the holidays. Here&amp;#39;s some digital gift giving solutions to make your Christmas go off with a bang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that kids spend 96% of their waking hours &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMf40ORFE8&quot;&gt;bug eyed&lt;/a&gt; in front of a computer screen these days, so base your gift purchasing decisions around feeding their online addiction. You&amp;#39;ll instantly become their favorite aunt/uncle whilst saving your shoe leather from miles of exhausting mall marching. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smallworlds.com/&quot;&gt;SmallWorlds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://minimonos.com/&quot;&gt;Minimonos&lt;/a&gt; are fantastic, safe browser based games that have millions of teenage players globally. Set up a funky game character and drop some credits on the account for in-game purchasing of digital merchandise. For young readers and learners, check out 8Interactive&amp;#39;s outstanding &lt;a href=&quot;http://8interactive.com/&quot;&gt;talking books&lt;/a&gt; on both iOS and Android. Great distractions for long car trips and waiting at the doctor for inoculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-16-icon-gift-apps-christmas-present.png&quot; alt=&quot;icon-gift-apps-christmas-present.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For adult friends and family what could be more personal than a new domain name managed right here at iWantMyName? Traditionally, most &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;new family blogs&lt;/a&gt; are set up over the holidays when Mom &amp;amp; Dad are busy snapping photographs. So it&amp;#39;s a great time to give away a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift&quot;&gt;domain name Christmas present&lt;/a&gt;. Got friends or family setting up a small business? Grab an appropriately branded domain and get them set up online with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/featured&quot;&gt;best business apps&lt;/a&gt;. Remember we offer almost 100 different domain extensions to choose from and easy one-click DNS setup for the best hosted apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the gifts are revealed and everyone&amp;#39;s feeling a little fatigued from too much egg nog and brandy infused Christmas pudding, grab your favorite web device and escape to a quiet spot for some online Christmas entertainment. We heartily recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt; for irreverent (and sometimes mildly disturbing) holiday reading for geeks. Gizmodo is the home of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5867026/its-time-to-win-lego-santa-yoda&quot;&gt;Lego Yoda Santa&lt;/a&gt;, so it must be cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a safe and happy festive season everyone!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New, Faster Domain Search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re excited to release a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/nsearch&quot;&gt;new version of the iWantMyName domain search&lt;/a&gt; today. During 2011 we&amp;#39;ve been paying a lot of attention to all the great feedback we&amp;#39;ve been getting from you about our service. Over the last few weeks we&amp;#39;ve worked really hard to implement some new ideas on the site that we think you&amp;#39;ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost 100 different domain extensions on offer, the main focus has been on improving speed and more efficiently displaying the search results on a single page. We&amp;#39;ve also added several different optional display filters such as categories and domain availability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-13-blog-new-domain-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;blog-new-domain-search.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s now also easier to search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;two-letter domain names&lt;/a&gt; as we will only show TLDs supporting these little goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/nsearch&quot;&gt;new search&lt;/a&gt; currently runs in public beta mode, so please let us know if you run into any issues &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;via our support center&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re looking forward to your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Flipboard Fan File</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-08-flipboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flipboard.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/12/07/flipboard-comes-to-the-iphone-and-you-can-download-it-now/&quot;&gt;buzz&lt;/a&gt; around this week about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8&quot;&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt; offering.The technology editor at UK&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-app-reviews/8941206/Flipboard-for-iPhone-review.html&quot;&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; calls it &amp;quot;one of the essential iPad Apps&amp;quot;. So with the iPhone version now launched, its quite likely to gather a huge following. But does Flipboard have universal appeal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flipboard is a &amp;quot;social magazine&amp;quot; iOS app that aggregates leading website and social media content. There&amp;#39;s no denying that Flipboard has a gorgeous look and feel on the iPad. But personally I find Flipboard&amp;#39;s magazine style layout a little random, making it less interesting for me. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just how my brain works, but I tend to follow specific verticals rather than put my faith in variety. If I was on a long flight, I&amp;#39;d read Wired and Nat. Geo. from cover to cover, because that&amp;#39;s what interests me. If I&amp;#39;m playing online, I want to thoroughly check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#%21/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; and the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/flipboard_iphone_app.php&quot;&gt;Read Write Web&lt;/a&gt; articles directly without the temptation to well...flip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no question that content based apps are now leading the charge in the media wars and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;hosted apps for business&lt;/a&gt; continue to gain traction globally as well. That&amp;#39;s why more and more media organisations are pushing their own apps out into the wild. It&amp;#39;s also why we launched our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone&quot;&gt;domain registrar iPhone App&lt;/a&gt; very early on. Do we need a single point of reference for all this content? Clearly, some think so, but I guess it&amp;#39;s no coincidence that many of the news organisations that have been raving about Flipboard are also signed up as content partners. Flipboard was not the first magazine app of course, there have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.appboy.com/2011/02/is-flyscreen-for-iphone-the-flipboard-we-never-got/&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;. But Flipboard has certainly had the most success in building out its partner relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Flipboard will probably grow on me over time the more I experiment with it. Have you downloaded the Flipboard iPhone App yet? What has your experience been like?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Domain Name Year 2011 In Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With the end of the year rapidly approaching, it&amp;#39;s timely to now look back on the events that defined the domain name industry in 2011. What a year it has been, notably with the approval of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). The long anticipated new domains will bring a flood of choices for naming your home on the web and an increasing need for next generation domain management tools and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are our domain industry highlights for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. New Generic Top-Level Domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet regulatory body &lt;a href=&quot;http://icann.org&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, concluded a lengthy history of internal debate and negotiation with multiple stakeholders that began with its formation in 1998. The organization unleashed approval to allow anybody to apply for a top-level domain. The historic move opens the doors to specifically branded domains, such as .ibm or .bmw, as well as new domains aimed at more general verticals, such as .hotel or .sport. There are also moves afoot to create domain brands for geographic regions, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotberlin.org/&quot;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotnyc.net/&quot;&gt;.nyc&lt;/a&gt;. The application window begins January 2012, but industry observers predict that it may be 2013 before the first new domains roll off the production line. It is anticipated that the new offerings will encompass internationalised domain name (IDN) facilities, incorporating non-Latin scripts from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTvmhk1Fqns&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Rising Popularity of Internationalized Country Domain Extensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 saw a marked rise in the adoption of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) across the globe; a trend likely to be accelerated as new top level domains begin to emerge. Registries from countries embracing a diversity of ethnicity and languages have been quick to become involved, with a total of 29 country code domains having been evaluated by ICANN. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idnnews.com/?p=9947&quot;&gt;Malaysia has been the most recently added&lt;/a&gt;, enabling fuller representation of Internet names across a nation of four different official languages and numerous regional dialects. Russia operates one of the most successful domains achieving over 800,000 registrations of Cyrillic domains on the transliterated .ru country code. More recently the Russians achieved dual listing status with the launch of the top level national domain .PФ (Российская Федерация).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bytelevel.com/map/IDN.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-12-08-idn-map-final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;idn-map-final.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bytelevel.com/map/IDN.html&quot;&gt;IDN map from Byte Level Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. .COM Reaching 100 Million Registered Names (almost)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we there yet? The familiar and reliable &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM domain&lt;/a&gt; has been around 26 years and is by far the most popular domain with nearly half of all global registrations. Whilst Planet Earth clocked up its 7 billionth citizen in 2011, .COM is expected to attain &lt;a href=&quot;http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/10/19/huge-internet-milestone-100-million-com-domain-names/&quot;&gt;100 million unique domains&lt;/a&gt; around about the end of the year (give or take a week). It is almost unbelievable to think that this plucky little generic top level domain (gTLD) had less than 10,000 registrants back in 1995, but has now become the standard for almost every &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/&quot;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;home user&lt;/a&gt; on the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Domain Name Sales Still Going Strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domainers, traders and domain real estate investors had a buoyant 2011, despite perturbations in the global economy. It seems some domains appreciate in value (a lot!). But the trick of course is to figure out which ones. In a year which saw both a Facebook movie and a staggering IPO by business network LinkedIn, it came as no surprise to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dnjournal.com/archive/lowdown/2011/dailyposts/20110621.htm&quot;&gt;social.com change hands for a cool $2.6 million&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of new gTLDs will no doubt stimulate and expand the market for highly sought after domains.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Rails Camp On Track</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-11-30-rails.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rails.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Ruby going from strength to strength as a web development environment, it&amp;#39;s encouraging to see plans for &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/railscamp&quot;&gt;Rails Camp 2012&lt;/a&gt; are already in full swing. The camp is an &amp;quot;unconference&amp;quot; style event that convenes Ruby On Rails hackers for a weekend of talking, coding and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 event held in the bush just up the road near Kaitoke was reportedly lots of fun. But next year the New Zealand meetup is heading down south to scenic Mt Cheeseman in the Craigieburn Range, Canterbury. The lodge there normally caters for skiiers, but being February, we doubt that snow will be too much of an issue. Rails Camps are deliberately held in remote locations away from earthly distractions such as TV, phone and Internet. It probably ensures only pure code is created (is there any other kind?) and temporarily eliminates annoyances such as ex-partners, kids and talkback hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; getting involved and local heroes &lt;a href=&quot;http://trineo.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Trineo&lt;/a&gt; also backing the event. We think these are both exciting companies worth watching. Heroku provides everything you need to securely deploy and scale applications and it has been pretty cool to see a steady stream of Rails developers &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&quot;&gt;domain customising Heroku&lt;/a&gt; set-ups with us. For those coming from far afield, Rails Camp also dovetails nicely with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webstock.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Webstock&lt;/a&gt;, the primo web design and development event for all the gifted and beautiful people, hosted right here in Wellington each year. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Vote iWantMyName</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Election 2011 weekend in New Zealand and almost anything could happen. Until the &amp;quot;tea-pot tapes&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3news.co.nz/Teapot-tapes-raise-questions/tabid/370/articleID/232724/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;debacle&lt;/a&gt;, many pundits were resoundingly predicting no change of government. But as they say, &amp;quot;a week is a long time in politics&amp;quot;. Last minute resurgences by the minor parties have thrown the cat amongst the pigeons, with political &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; running hot with commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiwis have been using a mixed member proportional voting system (MMP) since 1996, but the current government agreed to deliver a referendum this year to allow voters an opportunity to express their satisfaction (or otherwise) with the current system. MMP is very similar to the way our friends in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinname.com/&quot;&gt;domain of Germany&lt;/a&gt; vote and, whilst not without its faults, has provided relatively stable coalition style governments that build consensus with input from a diversity of political viewpoints. Even if there is a vote for change, it will be 2017 before a different voting system would be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening should be entertaining as the results are announced. In particular we will be hoping to see good returns for those parties that prioritise environmental issues and are promoting more investment in research, science and technology as an economic growth platform. But whatever your political hue, as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&quot;&gt;community-minded&lt;/a&gt; company, we think the most important thing is to get out there and exercise your democratic right on the day. Remember there are many less fortunate societies that do not provide such an option to their people.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dashboard Updates: Improved Heroku DNS Setup, Notes &amp; Marketplace Search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week we&amp;#39;ve been working on improving our dashboard in response to great feedback you have given us during &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend Wellington&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ability to add notes for a domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now add free-form notes to any of your domains with additional information. Fill in whatever you want, e.g your girlfriend&amp;#39;s birthday (you can never have enough reminders), links to external services (you can use basic HTML) or hosting-related information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-11-12-domain-notes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Notes To Your Domain&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Marketplace App search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost 100 entries in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;iWantMyName marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, it has become increasingly more difficult to find the app or service you&amp;#39;re looking for. The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps&quot;&gt;marketplace search&lt;/a&gt; will help you to set up domains even faster from your dashboard now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-11-12-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;iWantMyName Marketplace Search&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Choose your Heroku application stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&quot;&gt;setting up custom domains for Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;#39;s now a drop-down menu that let&amp;#39;s you choose whether you&amp;#39;re using the Cedar or Aspen / Bamboo stack. This will add the necessary CNAME and A record DNS settings for your app on Heroku automatically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-11-12-heroku.png&quot; alt=&quot;Heroku DNS Setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more to come in November, you should especially keep an eye on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=ThisSearchWillBeAwesomeSoon&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>uSnap.Us Snaps Up Startup Weekend Prize</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-11-07-usnap.png&quot; alt=&quot;usnap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a huge amount of fun during Wellington Startup Weekend and were greatly pleased that we were able to contribute time and resources towards making it such a successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was especially gratifying to have been able to supply a cute domain hack for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://usnap.us/&quot;&gt;uSnap.Us&lt;/a&gt; team who eventually won the event. uSnap.Us offers a clever photo aggregation service allowing wedding guests to upload digital images to a predetermined online location. The initial &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot; will be wedding parties, but the company has plans to offer the service for other kinds of events as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uSnap.Us team included a number of identities from the Wellington &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; community including Owen Evans (chief architect at Xero) and Jacob Creech (co-founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/intuitionhq-gets-landing-pad-boost.html&quot;&gt;IntuitionHQ&lt;/a&gt;). The Startup Weekend judging panel featured an impressive lineup including founding editor of tech blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/&quot;&gt;Read Write Web&lt;/a&gt;, Richard MacManus.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Startup Weekend Brings Entrepreneurial Buzz To Capital</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-31-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost time for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and we are once again getting excited about being involved in the initiative. Startup Weekend is a global phenomenon that assists entrepreneurial designers, developers and business heads to devise, build and launch a product in the short space of 54 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName is shouting drinks for all participants on Friday evening when the event will be opened by Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown. Several of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&quot;&gt;iWantMyName team&lt;/a&gt; will also be on hand throughout the weekend to help with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html&quot;&gt;business and technical advice&lt;/a&gt; whenever called upon. Of course we will also be providing each of the teams with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/iwantmyname-backs-startup-weekend.html&quot;&gt;free domain name&lt;/a&gt; for the new project in the same manner that we did for Auckland Startup Weekend and Startup Weekend Mega in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&quot;&gt;community-minded&lt;/a&gt; company we love to get behind events and initiatives that are of special interest to developers and designers in particular, especially where we can roll our sleeves up and get involved too! Of course we&amp;#39;ve also aggregated a huge selection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;domain customisable developer apps&lt;/a&gt; that are really handy for getting shiny new web projects up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Introducing Free Whois Address Masking To Protect Your Privacy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Domain privacy has been a long-awaited feature at iWantMyName and we&amp;#39;re happy to now give you an option to mask your home address in the public whois record without giving up ownership or transfer control. The service is free of charge and can be easily added to your domains from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/domains&quot;&gt;iWantMyName dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, domain registrations require your contact information to be provided for storage and display in the international whois database. This means that anyone in the world can view your address and phone number without restriction.
We appreciate that some of you may not want this due to obvious privacy reasons such as identity theft, fraud or stalking. By using our free whois protection, individuals can hide their address details (street, city and phone number) from unwanted eyes for the following domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gTLDs (generic top-level domains)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&quot;&gt;.BIZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mobi-domain-name-registration-for-mobile&quot;&gt;.MOBI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccTLDs (country code top-level domains)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands&quot;&gt;.CC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&quot;&gt;.LA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&quot;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ag-domain-name-registration-for-antigua-and-barbuda&quot;&gt;.AG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize&quot;&gt;.BZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lc-saint-lucian-domain-name-registration-for-saint-lucia&quot;&gt;.LC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mn-mongolian-domain-name-registration-for-mongolia&quot;&gt;.MN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sc-seychellois-domain-name-registration-for-seychelles&quot;&gt;.SC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/vc-domain-name-registration-for-saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines&quot;&gt;.VC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/so-somali-domain-name-registration-for-somalia&quot;&gt;.SO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enabling whois masking for one of your domains, you will still be the legal owner (registrant) and have access to all email addresses should you want to move to a different registrar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-26-whois-masking.png&quot; alt=&quot;Unprotected whois vs. protected whois entry&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Being Good Neighbours</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-21-event.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;event.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an emerging company within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;New Zealand domain&lt;/a&gt; technology industry, we take our community responsibilities seriously. But there&amp;#39;s a sound business strategy behind being a friendly neighbour. We are only as good as the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iWantMyName we are firmly committed to engaging with our local tech community. That&amp;#39;s why we are right behind event organisers such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Unlimited Potential&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/iwantmyname-backs-startup-weekend.html&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt;. Such events fit nicely with our own &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://blog.ideegeo.com/2011/01/04/ideegeo-consult-sniffing-out-ideas/&quot;&gt;tech mentorship&lt;/a&gt; initiative too. We organise and contribute to one or two tech meetups around Wellington because &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; are a core audience for us. We also get a huge thrill seeing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/intuitionhq-gets-landing-pad-boost.html&quot;&gt;successes&lt;/a&gt; of other tech firms and sharing the good news with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have selfish reasons as well. Starting and growing a tech company is a big job that requires entrepreneurs to draw on external skill sets and knowledge sometimes. It&amp;#39;s good for any new venture to get to know its neighbours. We also love getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; about new features; and when things go wrong (as they occasionally do with most tech sites) we&amp;#39;d rather hear about it from our friends first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from supporting community events we also use local businesses. In fact we are excited to be working with one of the coolest little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbybit.io/&quot;&gt;Wellington web design&lt;/a&gt; companies around as we give our site search functionality a Spring clean and makeover. After a hard day&amp;#39;s blogging and hacking we also hang out at craft beer pub &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlebeerquarter.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Little Beer Quarter&lt;/a&gt; and we do most of our coffee meetings over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welovemeow.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Meow Cafe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is facing a lot of challenges at present and it is only 
through building strong communities and supporting local businesses that we can make progress. We will be at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/events/up_agm_beer_tasting&quot;&gt;UP AGM and Beer Tasting&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/2011/10/13/startup-social-gets-creative-juices-flowing/&quot;&gt;Startup Social&lt;/a&gt; next week. Maybe, see you there?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Six Revisions Promotes Site Builder Trial</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-12-squarespace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;squarespace.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an inspired multi-media match, popular web design and development blog site &lt;a href=&quot;http://sixrevisions.com/&quot;&gt;Six Revisions&lt;/a&gt; has teamed up with one of our favourite apps Squarespace to offer a one year &lt;a href=&quot;http://sixrevisions.com/contests/giveaway-3-subscriptions-to-squarespace-website-builder/#more-5999&quot;&gt;free account subscription&lt;/a&gt; for three lucky users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six Revisions engages writers, who are also developers and designers in real life, to thoughtfully craft comprehensive articles across a wide spectrum of topics on web development. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com/&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; provides an outstanding hosted website builder application that has sky-rocketed in popularity these last few years. In fact Squarespace was one of the first apps that we implemented, allowing easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&quot;&gt;one-click set-up of a Squarespace site&lt;/a&gt; on your chosen domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of Squarespace is an interesting one that somewhat mirrors our own, having also begun life bootstrapped from a suburban bedroom. Despite advice to the contrary, Squarespace moved very early to distance itself from advertising based revenue. Founder Anthony Casalena soon realised that customers would pay for excellence, so consequently focused on building an easy-to-use interface that allowed people to have fun building cool websites for themselves. By 2009 Squarespace found itself on the Inc. magazine Fast 500 list and was soon attracting the attention of some seriously influential investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace offers a trial account, so users can play and check out the service without obligation. But the Six Revisions offer extends to a full service subscription for a whole year. Simply add a comment to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sixrevisions.com/contests/giveaway-3-subscriptions-to-squarespace-website-builder/#more-5999&quot;&gt;Six Revisions blog article&lt;/a&gt; explaining why you&amp;#39;d love a free Squarespace account. The competition closes on October 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SEO Advantages Of Your Own Video Site</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest post by Ray Pawulich, VidCaster.com:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At VidCaster, we give our users the tools to &lt;a href=&quot;http://vidcaster.com&quot;&gt;build their own video site&lt;/a&gt;. We focus on making this process as easy and painless as possible, but also loaded with advanced features that help you maximize your ROI from online video publishing. One of these features is video SEO that &amp;quot;just works&amp;quot; right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Key to Video SEO: The Video Sitemap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, video SEO is a subcategory of SEO (search engine optimization) focused on video. Unlike text-based content, video content is not inherently indexable by search engine crawlers. Just uploading a video file to your web-server is not enough for today&amp;#39;s search engines to index that content as a video &amp;mdash; if you want your content to come up when a user does a video search, you need to provide search engines with something called a &amp;quot;video sitemap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the advent of tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://vidcaster.com&quot;&gt;VidCaster&lt;/a&gt;, creating a video sitemap was a complicated, manual process. To make matters worse, search engines are constantly changing their desired format for a video sitemap, forcing you to stay on top of those changes and update your video sitemap yourself &amp;mdash; not a great proposition if your goal is to focus on creating &amp;amp; promoting your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of this way of doing things is that the vast majority of videos search results are driving traffic to video sharing sites like Vimeo and YouTube &amp;mdash; not the sites of the creators of that content!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, VidCaster has revolutionized the creation of the video sitemap by making it automatic and invisible to the user, allowing video publishers to drive traffic to their own site without any additional effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video SEO at Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at an example of how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackersandfounders.com/&quot;&gt;Hackers and Founders&lt;/a&gt;, a current VidCaster client, is leveraging video SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because their video site is set up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackersandfounders.tv/&quot;&gt;hackersandfounders.tv&lt;/a&gt; (which means their brand name is right there in the URL), if we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=hackers+and+founders&quot;&gt;search for &amp;quot;Hackers and Founders&amp;quot; in Google&lt;/a&gt;, right on the first page of results we see a video coming from their site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-08-vidcaster-blog_post_3.rtfd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search Result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this the only video result shown on the page, but as an individual searching that brand name, I instantly know from the URL that this is official content coming directly from that brand &amp;mdash; not user-generated content on a video-sharing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we click through, we are taken to a landing page on that site: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-08-hackersfounders.png&quot; alt=&quot;hackersfounders.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all the related videos are videos from Hackers &amp;amp; Founders &amp;mdash; there is no way that the viewer can get lost to someone else&amp;#39;s video. Try doing that on a video-sharing site!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By presenting the video in an environment over which they have full control, Hackers and Founders gives themselves the opportunity to use their video content to further a business goal &amp;mdash; which, in this case, is to drive traffic toward their sponsor, Microsoft BizSpark. As you can see, they&amp;#39;re doing though VidCaster&amp;#39;s in-player call-to-action capabilities as well as with a traditional banner ad on the site (something that&amp;#39;s also not possible on traditional video-sharing sites).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advanced video SEO: leveraging the video site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For SEO experts, the concept of their own &amp;quot;video site&amp;quot; opens up many possibilities for boosting the organic ranking of not only their video site, but their main site as well. This is because, whether you have your video site set up on its own domain (such as &lt;strong&gt;hackersandfounders.tv&lt;/strong&gt;) or as a subdomain (such as &lt;strong&gt;tv.airbnb.com&lt;/strong&gt;), search engines will consider your video site wholly separate from your main site &amp;mdash; even though you control both! This allows to strategically use cross-linking between the two in order to share the &amp;quot;SEO juice&amp;quot; one site might get to rank the other site higher for particular search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Now even easier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video SEO is a new and interesting space and VidCaster is proud to apply our &amp;quot;it just works&amp;quot; philosophy to this category. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re also proud to announce a new partnership with iWantMyName &amp;mdash; now if you use iWantMyName for domain name management, our service can be easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/video/vidcaster-custom-domain&quot;&gt;added to your domains with just one single click&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-10-04-yep.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;yep&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;#39;s featured website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecraft.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Codecraft&lt;/a&gt;, a group that has become a focus point for happenings in the software innovation scene around Dunedin. Codecraft is part of an active information technology &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://codecraft.org.nz/?q=node/8&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; in the region and is based at Otago University&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.otago.ac.nz/centreforinnovation/&quot;&gt;Centre for Innovation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group promotes &amp;quot;software craftmanship&amp;quot; as an underlying philosophy, invoking a sense of community and professionalism amongst members in their efforts to develop well crafted software. To support this approach Codecraft offers regular technical seminars for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt;, the details of which are posted on the website. Codecraft also encourages mentor-student relationships and works with other groups in the local software industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codecraft has connections with The Distiller an initiative that coaches &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.thedistiller.org/startups&quot;&gt;newly launched&lt;/a&gt; technology start-up businesses and which has recently extended its influence to Auckland. One of the earliest ventures to emerge from The Distiller was Pocketsmith a successful web based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pocketsmith.com/&quot;&gt;personal finance and budgeting&lt;/a&gt; app that has achieved some very positive &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/start-saving-pocketsmith-is-a-crystal-ball-for-your-bank-accounts/&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. Francois Bondiguel, a co-founder of Pocketsmith and omnipresent tech networker is a big fan of growing more software companies. It certainly shows with the contribution he and the team have made. The Deep South not only has outstanding wildlife, but also a vibrant &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/iwantmyname-backs-startup-weekend.html&quot;&gt;software start-up&lt;/a&gt; and innovation community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month has seen an increase in the variety of country code top level domains (ccTLD) on offer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyname&lt;/a&gt;. With four new domains joining us, it means we have by far the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;largest selection of domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; of any New Zealand registrar, with almost 100 on offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France played its first ever rugby test match against a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; side in 1906 and was soundly thrashed. History repeated itself in 2011 during their recent pool match encounter with the All Blacks at the Rugby World Cup. So we figured the least we could do was to add .FR to our list of domains. Rugby has a huge following amongst the French and many fans have made the pilgrimage Downunder to support &amp;quot;Le Bleus&amp;quot;, as the French national team are affectionately known. So if you are planning to export sporting goods or other services to Europe in the future, now is a great time secure a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;French domain name&lt;/a&gt; for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has done well against Cup minnows Russia and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/us-american-domain-name-registration-for-usa&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, but struggled against the Aussies. Perhaps that&amp;#39;s because, although she shares a border with France, Italy has a slightly different sporting culture. Football is the overriding passion, slightly ahead of making fun of their risque politicians. But we added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&quot;&gt;Italian domain&lt;/a&gt; to our United Nations of domains because .IT offers lots of crazy word play for domain hacks and is a great domain to own if you operate an information technology (I.T.) company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvia doesn&amp;#39;t feature in the World Cup. In fact they probably never even heard of the game of rugby. But we &amp;quot;luv&amp;quot; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/lv-latvian-domain-name-registration-for-latvia&quot;&gt;.LV domain &lt;/a&gt;and think their maroon and white national flag is rather cute too. The emerging Baltic state, whose inhabitants have strong ethnic links to both Russia and Germany, has been part of the European Union since 2004. Finally, somewhat closer to home, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html&quot;&gt;added a little oomph!&lt;/a&gt; by including .PH the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/ph-filipino-domain-name-registration-for-philippines&quot;&gt;domain name of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Assistly Takes Lead In Customer Service Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-30-logo-customer-support-assistly.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo-customer-support-assistly.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the Remington shaver man, high flying hosted enterprise software provider Salesforce.com loved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.assistly.com/&quot;&gt;Assistly&lt;/a&gt; so much that they acquired the company. It&amp;#39;s no surprise really. Assistly hits the sweet spot for small businesses using social software for customer support and looks set to take off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like Assistly too and recently integrated it into our technical support infrastructure which also includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://olark.com&quot;&gt;Olark&lt;/a&gt;, a cool live chat service. Offering friendly, rapid and engaging customer service is a non-negotiable item for the iWantMyName team, so we appreciate the way Assistly helps us record, track and action customer enquiries from our various &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;customer support&lt;/a&gt; channels and social feeds. In fact we also offer easy one-click DNS set-up on your domain through our app marketplace; so you too can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/helpdesk/custom-domain-assistly&quot;&gt;use Assistly for your own business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also recommend a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/&quot;&gt;hosted business services&lt;/a&gt; that can be domain customized and implemented within minutes. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; is a great e-commerce platform that gets online micro businesses up and running at very low cost. Naturally you&amp;#39;ll also be needing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; a nifty hosted office toolkit providing secure webmail, document sharing and a handy e-calendar. Want to create your own simple website to showcase your business? There&amp;#39;s no shortage of easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;website builders&lt;/a&gt; to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never been easier or cheaper to set up and operate your own web enabled, domain customized business.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.IT &amp; .FR Domain Registration For Everyone, Without Country Restrictions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;September has been our &amp;quot;TLD month&amp;quot; so far, with popular European extensions &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&quot;&gt;.IT (Italy)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;.FR (France)&lt;/a&gt; joining the previous additions &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/lv-domain-extension-now-available.html&quot;&gt;.LV (Latvia)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html&quot;&gt;.PH (Philippines)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; of newly available country code extensions at iWantMyName. And there&amp;#39;s more good news! Both the Italian and French suffix &lt;strong&gt;can be registered by anybody worldwide, the mandatory local presence is provided by a trustee partner&lt;/strong&gt; and already included in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain pricing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Italy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-29-Italy-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Italy-Flag-128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a population of just over 60 million, the Italian Republic is the 4th largest member state of the European Union (EU). The country shares borders with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. Most Italians prefer .IT domains over international domain extensions such as .COM, .NET or .ORG making it a must-have for companies or organizations who want to be present in the local market. Internationally, .IT domains are also popular for IT companies and domain hacks such as dlvr.it, play.it or fold.it which contributes to the growing number of 2.3 million registered domains in Italy. So join the club and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&quot;&gt;purchase your .IT domain today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-29-France-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;France-Flag-128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French Republic is number 2 in Europe when it comes to population size (64 million) but the biggest Western European country and largest member of the EU. With borders to Germany, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg and Belgium, the nation is literally located in the heart of Europe. Despite being a relatively large country, the French domain suffix only recently passed the milestone of 2 million registered domains having been held back by more stringent regulations in the past. However, these days, there is much greater &amp;quot;libert&amp;eacute;&amp;quot; in the .FR domain if you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&quot;&gt;establish your brand in France&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iWantMyName Backs Startup Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-20-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend is a global initiative that sees entrepreneurial developers, designers and business heads conceptualise, build and launch a tech venture over the space of a single weekend. We&amp;#39;ve been involved with the New Zealand events from day one with our free domain name offer for participating teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently also supported teams at Startup Weekend Mega, based in Silicon Valley. &amp;quot;Creativity occurs when ideas have sex&amp;quot;, says Tony Young Lyu whose company AdGame was &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/14/adgame-goes-from-zero-to-startup-hero-in-one-week/&quot;&gt;born at SW Mega&lt;/a&gt; and went on to be showcased at Demo Conference later that same week. Startup Weekend offers a supported environment for emerging tech entrepreneurs to network, build teams and meet amazing mentors, advisors and sometimes even investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we know how challenging it is to cut through the noise, build and launch a company on the web, we think Startup Weekend is a great project to get behind. Apart from our free domain offer, we&amp;#39;re involved in the New Zealand SW organising team and we have posted some great &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html&quot;&gt;online resources&lt;/a&gt; for budding entrepreneurs. Of course, we also recommend a swag load of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&quot;&gt;developer apps&lt;/a&gt; to help you build stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://auckland.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; Startup Weekend - 23-25 September&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; Startup Weekend - 4-6 November&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are offering a free one year registration of a .COM, .NET, .ORG or .ME domain name for each of the teams that goes beyond the Friday evening selection rounds. Event organisers will supply a code word so team members can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; to claim their domain during the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.LV Domain Extension Now Available</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-19-Latvia-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Latvia-Flag-256.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lv-latvian-domain-name-registration-for-latvia&quot;&gt;buy the .LV domain suffix&lt;/a&gt; from the Republic of Latvia. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lt-lithuanian-domain-name-registration-for-lithuania&quot;&gt;.LT (Lithuania)&lt;/a&gt;, it is the second TLD from the Baltic region in our growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;list of domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; at iWantMyName.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvia is bordered by Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus and the Russian Federation. With a total population of 2.2 million people, it counts to the smallest member states of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While .LV domains are mainly used in the country, registration is unrestricted for companies, organizations and individuals worldwide. This makes .LV an attractive TLD for URL shorteners or vanity URLs, e.g. from Las Vegas. Get started and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lv-latvian-domain-name-registration-for-latvia&quot;&gt;search for your own .LV web address today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.PH Domains Added</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-15-ph.png&quot; alt=&quot;ph.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve added some oom.ph to our extensive list of almost 100 unique Internet &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; by adding .PH the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ph-filipino-domain-name-registration-for-philippines&quot;&gt;Philippines domain&lt;/a&gt;. So now&amp;#39;s a great time to dream up some crazy domain hacks or perhaps a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=acidic.ph&quot;&gt;scientific domain names&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republic of the Philippines is a populous Southeast Asian island nation with an interesting political history. Occupied at various times by Spanish, American and Japanese, The Philippines lies in the warm waters of the Western Pacific Ocean and is subject to one or two severe tropical storms each year. The forested archipelago contains a rich array of flora and fauna, although logging and other activities have placed severe pressures on its biodiversity. There are a number of active volcanoes and in 1991 one of the largest eruptions in recorded history took place at Mount Pinatubo, less than 100km from the capital city Manila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of political upheaval and economic stagnation during the latter half of the 20th Century, The Philippines has shown signs of an economic rebound in the last decade. There are an estimated 10 million Filipinos working offshore who support families at home and an increasingly sophisticated manufacturing and service sector that leverages strong business relationships with nearby neighbours China, Hong Kong and Singpore and with its former colonist United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines domain is managed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://dotph.domains.ph/about-dotph/&quot;&gt;dotPH&lt;/a&gt; which had its orgins in a company formed in 1994. The domain registry has had a fully automated management system in place since 1999 and was one of the earliest to implement a shared registry system to streamline transactions with global registrars. Anyone may register a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ph-filipino-domain-name-registration-for-philippines&quot;&gt;.PH domain&lt;/a&gt;, although government domains, such as for education and military use, are restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making Magic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-09-07-toolbox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;toolbox.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh from the 3D scan and &amp;quot;make-off&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makers.org.nz/2011/08/15/3d-scan-and-print-showdown/&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, the Makers Movement is gathering steam in New Zealand - so to speak. Now the Makers are forging a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makers.org.nz/&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; to encourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://makers.org.nz/forums/&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; and collaboration amongst people who like to design and make stuff digitally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making and building things is in danger of becoming a lost art form as we become more and more reliant on pre-packaged, processed and pre-fabricated goods and with people spending more time with online entertainment. But the Maker community are fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With digital making service &lt;a href=&quot;http://ponoko.com/&quot;&gt;Ponoko&lt;/a&gt; based in Wellington, not to mention truck loads of creative and artistic types, it&amp;#39;s no surprise that the capital city has a core group of followers. There is even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonMakers/&quot;&gt;weekly meetup&lt;/a&gt; where you can catch up on everything that&amp;#39;s new in the world of making. Aucklanders are also building and creating, both digitally and in real life. There are frequent project sessions held at a physical maker space called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tangleball.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Tangleball&lt;/a&gt; for artists, builders and writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makers.org.nz/&quot;&gt;NZ Makers&lt;/a&gt; is our featured site for September. Want to share your next project with others? iWantMyName offers easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;one-click DNS set-up&lt;/a&gt; on your domain name for most popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;personal profile&lt;/a&gt; sites. We also offer almost 100 different &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; extensions to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>IntuitionHQ Gets Landing Pad Boost</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-08-31-ihq.png&quot; alt=&quot;ihq.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could Boost New Media be the next 37 Signals? The emerging Wellington company not only has a collection of award winning web design and development &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.boost.co.nz/work&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; under its belt, but the Boost team have also been working on a suite of web-based software products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the forefront of Boost&amp;#39;s push into productisation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intuitionhq.com/&quot;&gt;IntuitionHQ&lt;/a&gt;, offering web based usability software as a service. IntuitionHQ recently shot to prominence after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intuitionhq.com/blog/2011/08/good-news-everybody/&quot;&gt;winning&lt;/a&gt; the coveted Booster Seat 2011 prize against stiff competition from dozens of other aspiring New Zealand web and software start-ups. The competition was established by Rich Chetwynd and Nicole Fougere after a successful trade sale of their own web product Litmos. It means that IntuitionHQ gets a crack at the U.S. market through an all expenses paid month based at &lt;a href=&quot;http://unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/growth/us-landing-pad-taking-off?Opendocument&amp;amp;HighLight=2,landing,pad&quot;&gt;Landing Pad&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, that&amp;#39;s not all! Parent company Boost are deeply involved in community initiatives in the Capital and have thrown open their doors through a co-working space called &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.boost.co.nz/jelly&quot;&gt;Jelly&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer occasional free seminars in Agile development methodologies.

				<title>Startup Weekend Science</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-08-30-swmega.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;swmega.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test tube experiment. Assemble 300 keen young entrepreneurs in the same town as a world famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.demo.com/&quot;&gt;tech conference&lt;/a&gt;, invite one of Silicon Valley&amp;#39;s leading identities to speak and stir vigorously. Sounds like a recipe for success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mega.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend Mega&lt;/a&gt; will be the biggest (and coolest) Startup Weekend ever, so we are thrilled to be supporting the event. iWantMyName has been selected as the official supplier of domain names to all of the teams that go forward from the pitching session. That means we will be online throughout the event supporting our offer of a free year&amp;#39;s domain name registration of a .COM, .NET, .ORG or .ME domain to each team. We will also offer some discounts on the less common species of domains. But you have to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://mega.startupweekend.org/tickets/&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; at SW Mega, to take advantage of this offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;iWantMyName team&lt;/a&gt; know all about the challenges of building and growing a new tech venture. So we offer a whole bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/14-new-hosting-services-applications-for-your-domains.html&quot;&gt;hosted services&lt;/a&gt; in our app marketplace specifically aimed at assisting developers getting new ventures up and running; including easy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;one-click DNS set-up on your domain&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you already have a registrar, you can still use our nifty &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/introducing-dns-hosting-for-external-domains.html&quot;&gt;DNS management&lt;/a&gt; service across your domain portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend is a global phenomenon that invites entrepreneurial developers, designers and business heads to form teams, build a product and launch it in the space of a weekend. SW Mega is focusing this time on health, education and gaming - with the category winners earning an amazing opportunity to pitch at DEMO conference later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What&#39;s Your Point Of Difference?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When we share with others about the product we are building at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;, we often hear the question - &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s your point of difference?&amp;quot; There are dozens of resellers in New Zealand and literally thousands of domain registrars globally, so it&amp;#39;s a really good question that challenges us every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the industry there were only a handful of domains and a single service provider. But by the time the new millennium clicked over management of domain registration had become fully commercialised, with a regulatory body to make rules and adjudicate. Early players at the table became entrenched and the industry saw little innovation for the following decade. We wanted to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years we pioneered the concept of an app marketplace and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;one-click DNS set-up&lt;/a&gt; on your domain. That was a first for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;New Zealand domain registrar&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention the fact that iWantMyName offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;huge selection&lt;/a&gt; of almost 100 different domain extensions. Another recent development involved offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dns&quot;&gt;managed DNS hosting&lt;/a&gt;, a service we also make available to customers of other registrars. We also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; extensively as a support channel across all our sites globally and consistently aim for high satisfaction rates amongst our customers, many of whom have become friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are constantly reviewing our product offering in response to customer &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; and we have an ongoing product development roadmap to keep us busy, including big plans for a redesign and some cool new features for our search interface later this year. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Use !bang Commands To Manage Your Domain Names</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the primary goals at iWantMyName is getting out of the way of our customers when it comes to purchasing and managing domain names. We&amp;#39;re also big fans of &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;search engine DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; which inspired us to add some special sauce to our domain search, called !bang commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these !bang commands, you can easily add DNS records or other services such as Amazon S3, Github Pages or Tumblr to your domains directly &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;from the search box on iWantMyName homepage&lt;/a&gt;. The following !bang commands are currently supported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!edit domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; brings you to the domain status page where you can edit all settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!dns domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; forwards you to our DNS manager for adding new records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!nameserver domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; allows you to update the nameservers for a domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!transfer domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; immediately starts a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain transfer to iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!hostdns domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; creates a zone on our nameservers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dns&quot;&gt;host any external domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!updatewhois domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; change the whois data for a particular name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!gapps domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; easily set up Google Apps for your domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!s3 domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; lets you add Amazon S3 to your domain or subdomain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!github domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; adds Github Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!tumblr domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; adds Tumblr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip: DuckDuckGo !bang command chaining&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo users can also use !bang command chaining, for example try entering &amp;quot;!iwant !nsupdate domain.com&amp;quot; in the DuckDuckGo search field and you will end up at the nameserver update page in your iWantMyName dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be constantly adding new commands to our domain search and would also love to hear your suggestions in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Google Partners With Motorola</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-08-18-gplusm.png&quot; alt=&quot;gplusm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHiPs&quot;&gt;C.H.iPs&lt;/a&gt;, the popular 1970s cop show? Lead characters Jon and Ponch had Motorola radios prominently displayed on their police motorbikes. Now Motorola makes a different kind of chip and has just sold it&amp;#39;s mobile division to cash rich Google in a US $12.5 billion mega deal that pulls no punches about where the online behemoth is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial deal has raised eyebrows amongst some analysts who fear that Google will alienate other hardware manufacturers just as sales growth of its Android based platforms has taken off. On the other hand, the deal allows Google to have far greater control over its mobile product supply chain; meaning it can compete with Apple more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry critics have been focusing on the mobile story and the opportunity for Google to gobble up swags of proprietary patents with the acquisition; but there is another story that has been somewhat overlooked. Motorola Mobility also manufactures set-top boxes and IPTV equipment, a whole new area that Google has yet turn its full attention towards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an unrelated move, Google also recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/gco-official-url-shortcut-for-google.html&quot;&gt;acquired the G.co domain&lt;/a&gt; for use as a url shortener. This will allow it to offer more secure short links to its branded sites as social content sharing continues to grow. The domain purchase is a big win for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO domain&lt;/a&gt; registry that is rapidly gaining traction as a successful and trusted service provider with many big name customers. Already purchased your .CO domain elsewhere? Take advantage of this month&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;domain transfer&lt;/a&gt; offer or alternatively stay with your existing registrar whilst still enjoying easy DNS management with our no obligation &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/simplify-your-domain-dns-management.html&quot;&gt;hosted DNS management&lt;/a&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t Squash Your Customers Dreams</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest post by Josh Ledgard - founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kickofflabs.com&quot;&gt;KickoffLabs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your customers have a vision that&amp;#39;s uniquely theirs.  Your goal as a product or service provider is to fulfill that dream by getting out of the way and making it easier to achieve than your competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 18 month old son and one of my recent dreams involved teaching him to hit a ball off of a tee.  My wife told me I was crazy and that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to grasp the concept.  Then the first couple of tee-ball sets I saw said &amp;quot;Ages 3+&amp;quot;.  The result was that my dream was squashed and I didn&amp;#39;t buy anything.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found a tee-ball set that put the age at &amp;quot;18 months + &amp;quot;.  My dream was alive and I bought it right away. Sure enough, after an hour of practice my son can put the ball on the tee, grab the bat with two hands, and hit home runs over the couch.  Dream realized... happy customer. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At KickoffLabs we first based our pricing around the number of customer sign-ups on your landing page.  Even paid accounts were limited to tracking X number of customer signups and emailed newsletters.  But no matter how high we put that number people told us &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll have more than 100,000 customers quickly... what then?&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rationally I knew how hard it would be for ANYONE with a new/small business using our product to hit that kind of number.  But we were killing our customers dreams and that made them less likely to buy our product.  So we changed our pricing model to support unlimited customers so we weren&amp;#39;t squashing our customers dreams.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend going through your customer experience today and ask yourself... am I killing a dream? One better... ask your customers what they are dreaming about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Ledgard is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kickofflabs.com&quot;&gt;KickoffLabs&lt;/a&gt;. KickoffLabs makes creating landing pages and newsletters for new/small businesses super easy.  KickoffLabs and iWantMyName have teamed up to make your dreams easier to realize by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/kickofflabs-own-domain&quot;&gt;making it a quick two step process to wire your domain up to Kickofflabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>10 Good Reasons To Host Your DNS With iWantMyName</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Now that you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dns&quot;&gt;manage your DNS at iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;, here are some use cases for this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use our managed DNS hosting when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your current registrar does not include DNS management with your domain and you have to get it as an expensive add-on service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You would have to buy another add-on for URL forwarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ve registered a domain with your web host and they only allow full DNS access if you have a hosting package with them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not have the ability to add advanced record types such as TXT, SRV, AAAA or NAPTR. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an exotic domain that can only be registered at the registry directly, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cenpac.net.nr/dns/&quot;&gt;.NR (Nauru)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nic.as/&quot;&gt;.AS (American Samoa)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You would like to manage the DNS for domains which are not supported by us yet (we&amp;#39;re constantly working on adding more extensions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want easy domain setup for 70+ hosted services &amp;mdash; we make &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dns&quot;&gt;DNS simple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are planning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer a domain to iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; at a later stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You prefer to have all your domains listed in one &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/signin&quot;&gt;management dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are sick of the slow, cluttered and old-fashioned interface of your existing DNS host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the DNS hosting add-on and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dns&quot;&gt;start managing your domains at iWantMyName today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Simplify Your Domain DNS Management</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve just begun offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dns&quot;&gt;managed DNS hosting&lt;/a&gt; for domains not already registered through iWantMyName. So you can now manage domain names independently from a registrar or registry, as well as benefit from easy domain customisation of your preferred apps offered on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;iWantMyName marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new low cost DNS hosting add-on allows you to set A, CNAME, MX, AAAA, SRV, TXT, NAPTR record types in real-time and make use of URL forwarding services. Additional domain information such as current registrar, ownership details and expiration dates are also provided to users who purchase this service. You can effectively aggregate the management of any domains that you already 
have sitting with multiple registrar providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin&quot;&gt;Open&lt;/a&gt; a free account at iWantMyName, then purchase the DNS hosting add-on ($3.50/yr) for the domain you would like to manage via your iWantMyName dashboard.

				<title>Zerply Implements Profile Domain Customization</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-07-31-z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zerply.com&quot;&gt;Zerply&lt;/a&gt; is an online personal profile service that is rapidly gaining traction with creatives and young Internet users. The company has just launched domain customization, which means you can direct a chosen domain to your Zerply profile site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based at Mountain View venture incubator 500 Startups, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zerply.com/&quot;&gt;Zerply&lt;/a&gt; is an exciting new contender making waves in the digital profile space. Why wait until you need to look for a job before you start building an online profile? At &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;, we love stuff that takes away pain and drudgery. If you already have a personal profile elsewhere and want to move over to Zerply, they make this painless by offering an import process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zerply and LinkedIn are often mentioned in the same sentence. But where LinkedIn caters for corporate networkers and business professionals, Zerply pitches itself more as a solution for promoting one&amp;#39;s vocation generally. It also offers attractive design templates that users can tailor to their own specifications, differentiating it from the cookie-cutter approach of LinkedIn. This makes Zerply a more interesting proposition for folks wanting to express a little more individuality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the attraction with Zerply is that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zerply.com/premium/custom_domains&quot;&gt;unlike many other social network sites&lt;/a&gt;, you can now overlay your own personal domain name across your Zerply profile site. This adds a personal touch that continues to evade other similar services such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://about.me&quot;&gt;about.me&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Profiles&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, we&amp;#39;ve made it really easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/domain-customize-zerply&quot;&gt;connect your domain to Zerply&lt;/a&gt; by adding it to our growing list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;hosted services and apps&lt;/a&gt; in the iWantMyName marketplace. One click and you&amp;#39;re away laughing!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>NASA Cloud Collaboration Launches</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-07-22-shuttle70.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;shuttle70.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the final space shuttle mission completed, one could be forgiven for thinking NASA might be looking around for a new line of business altogether - but it&amp;#39;s not. In a collaboration with rock star hosting provider Rackspace, the American space explorer is launching into the cloud, to underpin its core business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a surprising move NASA and Rackspace have been working together for &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2011/07/19/what-a-year%C2%A0-openstack-at-one/&quot;&gt;over a year&lt;/a&gt; on a project called Open Stack that utilises software from both organisations. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/open-source/&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;  infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform technology will be made available through an Apache 2.0 license. Rackspace staff have been providing project governance, but the company anticipates other development leaders will come on board as the initiative evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstack.org/&quot;&gt;Open Stack&lt;/a&gt; is pitched firmly at other governmental agencies who will be comforted no doubt by the participation of one of the world&amp;#39;s leading edge, publicly funded technology providers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/072111-rackspace-cloud-openstack.html&quot;&gt;Rackspace announced&lt;/a&gt;recently that it will deploy Open Stack across its own infrastructure. It&amp;#39;s a cost effective win-win for NASA as well who expect to generate some useful crowd-sourced code development in return. With its sights firmly set on Mars and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;celestial domains&lt;/a&gt;, NASA will be needing a very robust computing platform to take the business of space exploration into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Registrations Reflect Web Commerce Explosion</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-07-13-growth.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;growth.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of registered domains grew by over 4.5 million in the first three months of 2011, suggesting that the industry remains in good heart. Despite other businesses emerging only tentatively from global economic recession, domain registrars clocked up almost 8% in growth over the previous 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain registration growth rates parallel a burgeoning Internet scene as web services continue to eat into traditional business models. Rapid growth in mobile and social content also draw in ever greater numbers of consumers. Internet infrastructure provider Verisign manages provisioning for .com and .net domains, which make up around half of all registrations and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/why-verisign/research-trends/domain-name-industry-brief/index.xhtml&quot;&gt;reports quarterly&lt;/a&gt; on Internet growth. On average Verisign currently handles an astounding 57 billion domain name system queries each day. At peak levels of demand this can reach 67 billion transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of Global web commerce is expected to reach almost US$1 Trillion within a couple of years and will be a key driver in overall growth of the Internet. Annual mobile commerce currently sits at a mere 2% of consumer sales transactions, but is expected to grow to US$15 billion in value within 5 years in the United States alone. So there remains plenty of scope for growth in new web and mobile commerce Internet offerings - and in the demand for domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Web Domain Underpins Social Media Stream</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-30-network.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;network.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media Day&lt;/strong&gt; kicks off around the world today with a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/events/social_media_day_mashup&quot;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; aimed at promoting discussion about social media. So now with the prospect of many &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/new-era-unfolds-for-domains.html&quot;&gt;new domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon, it is timely to think about the importance of a good domain name in relation to social media. Whether you are promoting a business or a personal brand, your domain name ultimately forms the foundation for all your online marketing initiatives because the website you own should be the confluence of your social media stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rand Fishkin, founder and CEO of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seomoz.org/blog&quot;&gt;SEOMoz web community&lt;/a&gt; and analytics summed it up nicely when asked recently about his preference between a self-managed website and using social media solely to promote a brand. Whilst he stresses that social media has huge reach, he also cautions us that none of the major social media platforms will ever be customisable in the same way as if you actually control your own site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&amp;quot;With a website, you can custom build virtually any form of analytics, leverage any type of web technology to display/deliver content and control your own destiny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Whether you are building an online business or simply growing your own personal brand, if your website remains the focus then by extension your web domain is the fundamental basis for your online brand initiatives. In fact there are many domain customisable &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;web services&lt;/a&gt; that can help you project your brand image online. These range from &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;personal profile sites&lt;/a&gt; that aggregate your social media stream through to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; and simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&quot;&gt;site builders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/strong&gt; offers almost &lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt; different domain extensions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;choose&lt;/a&gt; from and easy one click set-up for dozens of cool web services.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why You Should Not Rely On Your Social Media Presence Only</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Rand Fishkin of &lt;a href=&quot;http://seomoz.org/&quot;&gt;SEOmoz&lt;/a&gt; fame hits the nail on the head with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seomoz.org/blog/answers-to-4-excellent-seo-questions&quot;&gt;his answer&lt;/a&gt; to the following Tweet: &amp;quot;if he could have just one: site or social media presence. Which one would he choose and why!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/pedrodias/status/82902994831687680&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-29-seoquestion1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter Question Own Site Or Social Media Presence&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rand&amp;#39;s excellent answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d always bias to taking the website over the social media presence. It&amp;#39;s not that a great Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare or LinkedIn account aren&amp;#39;t great, it&amp;#39;s just that the flexibility, power, branding and measurability of a website has yet to be matched on any platform. With a website, you can custom build virtually any form of analytics, leverage any type of web technology to display/deliver content and control your own destiny. Even if Facebook or some other new, wholly flexible platform allowed for all of these features, you would still never truly own your home on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a huge supporter of and advocate for social media marketing, but I don&amp;#39;t think I could ever endorse having your primary base of marketing and acquisition happen anywhere but on a site you fully own and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is exactly why should have &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;your own domain name&lt;/a&gt; which easily allows you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;switch services&lt;/a&gt; at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Cyclist Peddles Goods With Shopify</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-28-cycle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cycle.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claire Pascoe loved bicycles and cycling so much that when she left New Zealand to go on her travels she soon spotted a unique opportunity for an importing business. Impressed by the multitude of artistic pannier bags available for riders overseas, she decided to bring some home and open her own online shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But setting up an e-commerce site is really hard isn&amp;#39;t it? Turns out that it&amp;#39;s not hard at all. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; is a hosted service that lets you easily set up your own &amp;quot;e-tail&amp;quot; store on the Internet. We think Shopify is great, so we included it within our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;services suite&lt;/a&gt;. That means once you&amp;#39;ve opened your Shopify store, you can easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&quot;&gt;add a Shopify set-up&lt;/a&gt; to your new domain with a single click. We&amp;#39;ve even included a video to talk you through the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claire thinks Shopify is great too and now uses it to run &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beautifulbikebags.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Beautiful Bike Bags&lt;/a&gt; where you can check out her wonderful selection of creative cycle bags. Now (unlike our friend pictured above) there&amp;#39;s simply no excuse for cyclists to feel overburdened on the way home after a spot of shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tumblr changes custom domain setup</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Blog hosting service Tumblr recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://staff.tumblr.com/post/6390139071/upgrading-messages&quot;&gt;released a new dashboard version&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately making it harder to find the settings for adding your custom domain to their system. The feature moved from the easy to remember URL &lt;code&gt;tumblr.com/customize&lt;/code&gt; to the setting page for a specific Tumblr site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a quick tutorial on how you can domain customize your Tumblr web address in their new dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-28-new-tumblr-setup-small-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;New Tumblr Dashboard Custom Domain Setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-28-new-tumblr-setup-small-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Change Your Tumblr URL&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have your own custom domain yet? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Change your Tumblr URL in 3 simple steps today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Introduction To New Top-Level Domains [VIDEO]</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Good introductory video on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/new-top-level-domain-extensions-are-coming.html&quot;&gt;new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs):&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Amex Checks In To Four Square</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-23-mobi-thumb-150x150-112.png&quot; alt=&quot;mobi.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/&quot;&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; deal between Four Square and American Express deepens the context of the connection between retailers and location based games and services and is another step towards fulfilling the promise of mobile commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years there has been an expectation that your mobile phone would become your wallet, map directory and purveyor of deals and discounts. That vision is finally being realised as mobile platforms rapidly mature in sophistication and power. Even five years ago, you&amp;#39;d be hard pressed to find a good phone that could accurately identify location and contactless payment systems were pie-in-the-sky. Now service providers are able to add layers of convenience through powerful but lightweight mobile applications that travel with you everywhere. Retailers, banks and other businesses are rapidly coming to terms with the opportunities this presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments only strengthen the case for companies and individuals to secure and protect their &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/11/anchor-your-social-media-presence-with-a-domain.html&quot;&gt;digital branding&lt;/a&gt; presence by managing their own Internet domain. Retailers in particular that fail to do so are missing out on a world of opportunity. QR codes are another method of connecting businesses to mobile users, which is why we auto-magically provide these codes for each domain within your iWantMyName dashboard. Dont forget, you can also search, check and manage domains on the go with our trusty &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone&quot;&gt;iPhone App&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New Top Level Domain Extensions Are Coming!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-21-icann.png&quot; alt=&quot;ICANN Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet body &lt;a href=&quot;http://icann.org&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; meeting in Singapore this week is presiding over the most significant opening up of the domain name system (DNS) for many years. ICANN has agreed in principle to allow &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html&quot;&gt;new top-level domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; known as generic top level domains (gTLDs). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approval for new gTLDs has been long awaited by entrepreneurs and digital branding pundits who plan to create domains for cities, global corporations and popular commercial products such as food (.food, .restaurant), sports (.basketball, .ski), banks (.bank, .secure) or airlines (.united, .lufthansa). But the new TLDs also have their critics who claim the initiative is simply a money grabbing exercise and that the emphasis should be towards addressing better security and making the Internet more inclusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However ICANN has responded by ensuring that the cost and regulatory barriers to forming a new domain suffix are substantial. In reality there is unlikely to be an avalanche of new gTLDs and in the meantime there has also been progress on DNS security and the provision of internationalized character sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your views on ICANN and its elephantine bureaucracy, we are sure to see some changes in the domain landscape over the next few years. Major corporates such as IBM, Canon, Apple and BMW are looking at securing their own TLD whilst forward thinking cities like Berlin (.berlin) or New York (.nyc) may soon have a custom domain extension. In many cases gTLD owners will acquire domains strictly for their own internal use. But brand managers around the world will need to keep a close eye on other suffixes that emerge in public. Individual users should also think about how they can leverage the new domain endings to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile&quot;&gt;personal brand presence&lt;/a&gt; online.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-06-13-Guyana-Flag-128.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flag Guyana Domain Name&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.LY, the Lybian domain extension which is popular (but not uncontroversial) among startups is getting domain hack competition from the South American country of Guyana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guyanese top-level domain suffix .GY can now be registered at iWantMyName without restrictions and by anybody worldwide. If you have registered one with another registrar, you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gy-domain-registrar-transfer-guyana&quot;&gt;transfer .GY domains&lt;/a&gt; to our service at a discounted price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re sure .GY domain hacks will go quickly so don&amp;#39;t wait and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gy-guyanese-domain-name-registration-for-guyana&quot;&gt;buy your desired .GY domain&lt;/a&gt; for your app, website or URL shortener today!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Airline Builds Brand With Domains</title>

Highly successful media, travel and entertainment group Virgin operates literally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virgin.com/company/&quot;&gt;dozens of companies&lt;/a&gt;, but obviously you can only be a Virgin once. So how did they solve the problem of finding and securing unique domain names for the many businesses and markets the company was engaged in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although .COM remains the most popular domain extension and offers the fastest way to generate website traffic, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure unique domains that fully represent a business brand. When Virgin took up the challenge of building a new airline in Australia, they sought out a brand name that both reflected the company&amp;#39;s heritage and meant something to parochial Australians - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virginblue.com/&quot;&gt;Virgin Blue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Virgin decided to launch subsidiary &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://flypacificblue.com/&quot;&gt;Pacific Blue&lt;/a&gt; to offer services around New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Unfortunately at that time Pacific Blue also happened to be the name of a well known American television soap opera. But by adding the word &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; to their domain, Virgin created a unique web branding tool that didn&amp;#39;t conflict. Another technique used by the airline&amp;#39;s marketers involves securing related domains and making sure they also point to the Pacific Blue site, for example www.pacificblueairlines.com. Now the airline group  is in the process of re-branding once again as Virgin Australia. That will no doubt keep their marketers, web developers and domain registrar very busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that you can still secure a great domain for your business brand, with a little extra creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Easily Move Domains Between iWantMyName Accounts</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After last week&amp;#39;s announcement of some &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/05/free-domain-transfer-uk-nz-io-domains.html&quot;&gt;newly transferable domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;, it is now also possible to move domains within iWantMyName from one customer to another. This is especially helpful if you want to separate domain management for clients or if you have sold a web address to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To internally move a domain, the new account holder simply can use our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;regular website transfer procedure&lt;/a&gt;. All that is needed to start the process is the authorization code from the current owner which can be found on the domain status page in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard&quot;&gt;iWantMyName dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. Internal transfers are processed in real-time meaning the new owner has immediate access to all domain settings. Now that&amp;#39;s easy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Free .CO.UK, .CO.NZ &amp; .IO Domain Transfers + Newly Transferable Extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re happy to announce that you can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer&lt;/a&gt; a whole bunch of new country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) to iWantMyName. Most importantly,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-registrar-transfer-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.UK transfers&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; often requested by our friends in the United Kingdom &amp;mdash; and other European suffixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These domains are newly transferable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-domain-registrar-transfer-belgium&quot;&gt;.BE (Belgium)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-registrar-transfer-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.CO.UK (United Kingdom)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me.uk-domain-registrar-transfer-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.ME.UK&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.uk-domain-registrar-transfer-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.ORG.UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-domain-registrar-transfer-spain&quot;&gt;.ES (Spain)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-domain-registrar-transfer-europe&quot;&gt;.EU (Europe)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Transfer Your Kiwi Domain For A Song</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;May is New Zealand Music Month. What began as an initiative to promote more airtime for Kiwi artists has evolved into a full blown celebration of talent from our local music industry. In the current economic climate it&amp;#39;s more important than ever to support local artists. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzmusicmonth.co.nz/&quot;&gt;NZ Music Month website&lt;/a&gt; has all the gen including a comprehensive gig guide, news and multi-media content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locally developed music portal &lt;a href=&quot;http://musichype.com/&quot;&gt;MusicHype&lt;/a&gt; loves Kiwi music too and is helping fans to connect with both New Zealand and global artists. They even scored a very cool domain musichy.pe by cleverly using .PE the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/pe-peruvian-domain-name-registration-for-peru&quot;&gt;Peruvian domain extension&lt;/a&gt;. Bands and musicians can also easily set up their own promotional sites using their chosen domain name with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/music/&quot;&gt;great services&lt;/a&gt; such as BandCamp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A memorable domain makes heaps of difference when it comes to expressing yourself creatively on the web. Being able to manage your domain easily with a friendly local registrar makes a big difference too. So iWantMyName is rocking your world by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;dropping the transfer fee&lt;/a&gt; on all .NZ domains from this month. We&amp;#39;ve also seriously whacked the fees on transfers for other kinds of global domains. That&amp;#39;s got to be music to anyone&amp;#39;s ears.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>We&#39;re Going To ICANN San Francisco</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-03-11-svsf-logo-final-330x194-08feb11.png&quot; alt=&quot;svsf-logo-final-330x194-08feb11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iWantMyName team will attend next week&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://svsf40.icann.org/&quot;&gt;ICANN meeting in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; (13-18 March) to meet with domain industry professionals and catch up on the latest developments in ICANN&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtld-program.htm&quot;&gt;new gTLD program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are interested in &lt;del&gt;partying&lt;/del&gt; meeting with us, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;ping us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:timo@iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;timo@iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Online Profile Services Easy To Customise</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-03-07-flavors50.png&quot; alt=&quot;flavors50.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iWantMyName we make it really easy to personalise your web profile service with a domain of your choice. A number of the big social networking sites don&amp;#39;t allow this, so where do you go if you want a profile site that reflects your personality? We&amp;#39;ve dug up some &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;cool web profile services&lt;/a&gt; that we think you&amp;#39;ll love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up we are big &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; fans and have to say it makes a great profile service as well as a blogging site. It&amp;#39;s really easy to tailor your Tumblr site with nice images or backgrounds and posting is a breeze too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/customize-flavors.me-website-with-your-own-domain&quot;&gt;Flavors.me&lt;/a&gt; is also a great way to go, but differs in that it aggregates all your content in one place. Flavors.me is especially handy if you have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flavors.me/jboydphoto&quot;&gt;creative business&lt;/a&gt; and want to show off your talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personal domain &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/11/anchor-your-social-media-presence-with-a-domain.html&quot;&gt;anchors and protects&lt;/a&gt; your presence online and best of all its portable. There&amp;#39;s a bunch of other services on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/&quot;&gt;profile services page&lt;/a&gt; that you can have fun exploring as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The .AF TLD can be registered by anybody worldwide. It also supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;2-letter domain registration&lt;/a&gt; for short domains and a popular choice for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt;. Our domain pricing for the .AF web address is $125 USD for new registrations and renewals.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Startups - Let&#39;s Get Cracking!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-26-sw65.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sw65.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand is expected to take a big economic growth hit after a second devastating &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/christchurch-quake-shock.html&quot;&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; in Christchurch. The seriousness of this catastrophe cannot be overstated. That&amp;#39;s why we urge everyone to get behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://auckland.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; a networking and web venture catalyst event being held in Auckland on the weekend of &lt;strong&gt;1st-3rd April&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever before in New Zealand&amp;#39;s history we all have to pull together to help keep the ship afloat. Entrepreneurs have the power to lead us out of recession and to generate new wealth that will help rebuild Christchurch. But we need to actively cultivate communities of interest and leverage the wonderful talent we have here in New Zealand. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; we already mentor young web entrepreneurs and are deeply involved in community building within the ICT industry. That&amp;#39;s why we are so pleased to be able to support the inaugural New Zealand Startup Weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for smart and entrepreneurial developers, designers, web strategists, marketers and investors from all over the country to rock up, collaborate and build stuff. Bring an existing team or just turn up and volunteer your business or tech skills to a brand new project on the day. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you can help out with cash sponsorship or services that would be brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>32 static website generators for your site, blog or wiki</title>

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, all a geek needs is a quick way to generate a static site and put it up on a server or hosting service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/setup-custom-domain-amazon-s3&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.

				<title>Christchurch Quake Shock</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-22-redcross.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cross&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will be aware New Zealand suffered one of it&amp;#39;s most devastating natural disasters of modern times earlier today when our second largest city Christchurch was struck by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/TVNewZealand#p/a/u/2/KetOf15Q3lc&quot;&gt;severe earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. We already know that many small historic buildings were badly damaged, several large office buildings were completely destroyed and sadly it appears likely that the number of deaths will rise substantially from the first estimate of 65. The region had only just begun to recover from a quite severe quake event in September 2010, but this time it is much more serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts go out to the people of Christchurch and especially to our friends and customers from that region. At this stage of the crisis the main focus is on rescue amidst the debris. If you are worried about a missing friend or family member or would like to help in a practical way, there are a number of resources available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Google have set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://christchurch-2011.person-finder.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;person finder site&lt;/a&gt; that may be of some use.*   Red Cross missing persons phone line 0800 733 276 or +64 7 850 2199&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Other Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/christchurch_earthquake.html&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;.*   Crisis Commons &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/CrisisCampNZ&quot;&gt;wiki site&lt;/a&gt; available online.*   TradeMe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trademe.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-support&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; with helpful links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Ushahidi &lt;a href=&quot;http://eq.org.nz/&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; with localised information and civil defence updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  To make an offer of accomodation in &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.wellington.govt.nz/news/display-item.php?id=4334&quot;&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; for evacuees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;NEW&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://findaroom.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Findaroom&lt;/a&gt; accomodation site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Offers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.aucklandnz.com/index.php/content_B/?L1=36&amp;amp;L2=27&amp;amp;L3=&amp;amp;id=6160&quot;&gt;accommodation&lt;/a&gt; in Auckland for evacuees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  To arrange to donate blood in NZ call 0800 GIVE BLOOD (0800 448 325).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Donate cash to assist the Salvation Army&amp;#39;s efforts in Chrischurch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Local New Zealand government phone emergency helpline for people affected by the quake &lt;strong&gt;0800 779 997&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: 2pm Thur 24 Feb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to donate cash to help the relief effort, we recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redcross.org.nz/&quot;&gt;New Zealand Red Cross website&lt;/a&gt; which is now fully operational again thanks to a collaborative effort amongst techies here in Wellington. We&amp;#39;ve also helped out with getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://eq.org.nz/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eq.org.nz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Check Domains Using Your Browser&#39;s Address Bar, AlfredApp and DuckDuckGo</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to quickly search for domain names from the address bar of your favorite browser, app launcher or search engine, we have some tips how to set things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Safari (using Glims)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.machangout.com/&quot;&gt;Glims&lt;/a&gt; is not only useful for custom keyword search but also adds lots of other helpful features to Safari. You need to install this plugin first to do the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-21-search-domain-glims.png&quot; alt=&quot;search-domain-glims.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve installed Glims go to you Safari preferences, add iWantMyName to the search engine list using the URL &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=#query#&lt;/code&gt; and choose the keyword for your custom query. All you have to do now is enter &lt;code&gt;iwmn domainname&lt;/code&gt; (or any other keyword of your choice) in your browser&amp;#39;s address bar and you will get our domain search result in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a bookmark in Firefox and replace the domain in our search URL, e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=yourdomainname&lt;/code&gt; needs to be replaced with &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=%s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-21-firefox-custom-search-add.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox-custom-search-add.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding a tag of your choice, you can now type &lt;code&gt;tagname domainname&lt;/code&gt; in your address bar which will give you the results for your domain search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycroft.mozdev.org/search-engines.html?category=29&quot;&gt;iWantMyName Open Search plugin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jannisgundermann.com&quot;&gt;Jannis Gundermann&lt;/a&gt; to add our domain search to Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A right-click in your address bar lets you edit the search engines Chrome uses. Simply add our search URL &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=%s&lt;/code&gt; and add the keyword you would like to use for your custom search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-21-google-chrome-domain-search-iwantmyname.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-chrome-domain-search-iwantmyname.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/muloka&quot;&gt;Louis Galipeau&lt;/a&gt;, you can also search for domains at iWantMyName directly from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; search box. Just enter &lt;code&gt;!iwant domainname&lt;/code&gt; and you will be forwarded to the search result page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-21-duckduckgo-domain-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;duckduckgo-domain-search.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;AlfredApp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Swiss knife of all app launchers&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to add custom searches. Go to &lt;em&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Features &amp;gt; Custom Searches&lt;/em&gt; and add the following domain search URL: &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain={query}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now define a keyword and you can immediately search from the AlfredApp window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-21-alfred-app-domain-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;alfred-app-domain-search.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other suggestions, tips or tricks we&amp;#39;d love to hear them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Also, don&amp;#39;t forget the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&quot;&gt;iWantMyName DomainApp for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; for domain checks and registration on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Stellar Cast Headlines Kiwi WordCamp</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2011-02-18-wp35.png&quot; alt=&quot;wp35.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 25 million users globally have set up web sites using open source CMS &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. So we are greatly pleased to be a micro-sponsor at this weekend&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcamp.org.nz/&quot;&gt;WordCamp New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;ve made a bunch of domains available as prize giveaways for conference delegates. Planning a new WordPress site? You might just score yourself a free 12 month domain registration on us. The offer extends to .COM, .NET, .ORG, .ME and .NZ domains. Conference organisers will provide more information on the day. But you need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcamp.org.nz/products-page-2/&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; and attend WordCamp NZ to be in the running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#39;s event is being held in the Oceania Room at Te Papa in Wellington which has superb harbour views and is only a few minutes walk from the central city. The speaker line-up is outstanding, including local hero Richard MacManus, founding editor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://readwriteweb.com/&quot;&gt;Read Write Web&lt;/a&gt; and John Ford whose current project is &lt;a href=&quot;http://vaultpress.com/&quot;&gt;VaultPress&lt;/a&gt; a back-up site for WordPress users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordCamp New Zealand is curated by Dan Milward, developer of the WordPress e-Commerce plug-in &lt;a href=&quot;http://getshopped.org/&quot;&gt;Get Shopped&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dialogcrm.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Jason Kemp&lt;/a&gt; who have done a wonderful job of attracting great speakers and building support. After a rather soggy 2010 experience the event was moved to summertime - so let&amp;#39;s hope Wellington puts on her best frock and red lippy and shows WordCampers a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Featured Domain: youMust.me - A Simple Recommendation Site</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://youmust.me&quot;&gt;youMust.me&lt;/a&gt; from 18-year old &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/zackfern&quot;&gt;Zack Fernandez&lt;/a&gt; is a simple tool to get all sorts of recommendations by sharing a personal URL with your friends. Zack was inspired by the recent success of &lt;a href=&quot;http://threewords.me&quot;&gt;threewords.me&lt;/a&gt; so he decided to launch his own project. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;registered the domain&lt;/a&gt;, created the site and tied everything together using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&quot;&gt;simplified Heroku DNS setup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how youMust.me works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your personal URL youmust.me/yourusername with your friends and ask them what you must &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;hear&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the results on your personal youMust.me homepage:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats to Zack for launching his site! Want to have your domain featured on our blog? Send me an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:timo@iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;timo@iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Some Browser Statistics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought this two years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com/chrome&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; was accounting for 41% of our visitors in December with &lt;a href=&quot;http://firefox.com&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; ranking 2nd (27%) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.com/safari&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; 3rd (21.50%). From the 5% using Internet Explorer, 70% are browsing with IE8+.
We quite like this.

				<description>&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName featured site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://365.io&quot;&gt;365.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Get A Personal Domain Christmas Gift</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-12-21-icon-gift-present.png&quot; alt=&quot;icon-gift-present.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas 2010 is getting close and we all know the rush for the last presents a few days before the gift-giving time. But why should you shop at overcrowded malls when you can buy the best Christmas gifts online? If you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;register a personal domain&lt;/a&gt; with iWantMyName, you don&amp;#39;t even have to be worried about delivery times or shipping costs because all domains are instantly activated - perfect for your last minute Christmas gift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get some personal web address ideas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Register FirstnameLastname for a truly unique and professional online experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Popular domain name extension for personal websites are .COM, .ME, .NAME, .IM, .INFO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Purchase an exotic country domain, e.g. .CX (Christmas Island) or .IO (Indian Ocean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personalize your domain Christmas present even more and add one of the web services from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;app directory&lt;/a&gt;. There are plenty of applications that can be easily customized with a personal domain name directly from the iWantMyName dashboard. Don&amp;#39;t worry, there are no technical skills required so anybody can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;easily register and set up a domain&lt;/a&gt; for their loved ones. Happy gift giving!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pukekos and Pongas</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-12-20-santa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;santa.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t manage to spot any pukekos in ponga trees on the First Day of Christmas, but otherwise it has certainly been quite a year of achievements at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;. Not only did we refine our service offering by overhauling the technology, but we also delivered seamless and straightforward domain management to many new Kiwi customers through the launch of our New Zealand domain registrar site. Even better, we were able to contribute to our local community with tech talks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/09/family-fun-forecast-for-software-freedom-day.html&quot;&gt;event sponsorships&lt;/a&gt; and behind the scenes project management support for some very &lt;a href=&quot;http://up.org.nz/media/news/wellington_to_the_world_2010_review&quot;&gt;cool events&lt;/a&gt; promoting technology entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having successfully rolled out our registrar technology into four markets globally we have begun to turn our attention to finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/10/domain-registrar-solution.html&quot;&gt;new partnerships&lt;/a&gt;. Got web industry or hosting experience and want to operate your own branded version of iWantMyName? No problem. The domain industry withstood the &amp;quot;Great Recession&amp;quot; throughout 2010 and continues to grow at more than 7% per annum with over 200 million domains. The current market leaders have been slow to innovate but are now looking to exit at high valuations. We think this will create a huge amount of buzz in our industry in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time now to take a few days off and play at the beach, enjoy some good food and drink and spend time with family. But our domain elves will still be keeping an eye on things. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if we can help in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much to everyone who signed up with us in 2010. Best wishes for a safe and happy Christmas holiday and a choice New Year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Big Thank You For 2010</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName is turning 2 years old in December 2010 and I&amp;#39;d like to personally thank you for supporting us thus far. While our first year was focused on getting everything up and running, the second year has been mainly about improving the stability and performance of iWantMyName. We are now already looking forward to 2011 with further improvements in mind, especially to the dashboard, domain search and overall usability of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would also love to receive comments from our valued customers. If you have any technical issues or complaints, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;tell us what we can do better&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you had a good experience, please share with your friends. Every referral and every piece of feedback helps us to build the best experience for domain seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable holiday season &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;from the whole team&lt;/a&gt; at iWantMyName!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timo Reitnauer&lt;/strong&gt;

				<title>Anchor Your Social Media Presence With A Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-11-29-anchor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;anchor.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mashable just published an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2010/11/28/small-business-resources/&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of its recent best articles on how small business can leverage social media. Whether it be using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/iWantMyName-NZ/118040718222943&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or learning how to get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone&quot;&gt;mobile app&lt;/a&gt; for your business, it&amp;#39;s a great set of resources. But it is important to remember that your domain is the brand anchor for all these services - choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some social media &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; allow you to use your own personal domain. Tumblr is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/10/tell-us-your-tumblr-tales.html&quot;&gt;good example&lt;/a&gt; of this and is an attractive, easy-to-use blogging service that is quick to set up. The beauty of owning and managing your domain is that you have complete control. Even if you need to change services, your domain remains constant. Improving your search ranking takes time and effort; owning your domain minimises the risk of falling into a black hole if you move house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration for small business is the ownership and protection of intellectual property. We heard of a case where a couple set up and grew a successful online business selling clothing. Sadly when the relationship ended, one party had complete control over the domain, hosting and content management and simply shut down the entire operation. Although the website brand and domain was actually the real life name of the aggrieved party, there was no legal recourse. Insisting on domain ownership and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iponz.govt.nz/cms/trade-marks/trade-marks-homepage&quot;&gt;filing a trademark&lt;/a&gt; would have prevented a lot of heart break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; has the widest range of domains available in New Zealand and is simply the best place to start your search for the perfect domain to anchor your online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New Tumblr? Get Your Own Domain!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ve just signed up for Tumblr and you are thinking of customizing your new website with a domain name? Then look no further, we have a special custom domain promotion for new (and of course existing) Tumblr users. Simply use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/tumblr&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and we will apply a 20% discount on your domain registration with iWantMyName.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-11-10-tumblr-domains-promo.png&quot; alt=&quot;tumblr-domains-promo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5 reasons why you should buy your own domain name for Tumblr:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YourName.com is a shorter web address than yourname.tumblr.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use custom email addresses @yourname.com with your domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not happy with Tumblr? Keep the domain and switch to another service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you to rank better in Google so that people can find you easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And last but not least - you can own a domain name, it&amp;#39;s all yours!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With iWantMyName, it&amp;#39;s dead-easy to register your domain name and set it up for your Tumblr page. Feel free to share this Tumblr custom domain promotion with your friends. All they have to do is visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/tumblr&quot;&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and they will get 20% off on any new domain purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Featured Site: Facelette.com</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The iWantMyName team got a huge buzz last week when we saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/2010/10/facelette-on-techcrunch-in-three-hours-and-zero-dollars/&quot;&gt;this post by Zach Holman&lt;/a&gt; explaining how he launched a new service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://facelette.com/&quot;&gt;Facelette&lt;/a&gt; after Apple&amp;#39;s recent FaceTime launch. Basically FaceTime simplifies video calls between any Apple device. Holman whipped up a neat application that helps you randomly meet other FaceTime users and interact with them. The funniest part of this story is that the whole project got built, launched and then received a TechCrunch review within three hours and at no development cost whatsoever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love Zach&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;just get on and do it&amp;quot; attitude and that he didn&amp;#39;t begin Facelette by writing a boring business plan and hawking it around fifty different VC companies in the hope of getting funding. There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with hacking a fun project and just putting it out there to see what happens. It&amp;#39;s called creativity and it&amp;#39;s something intangible that occasionally gets lost in the headlong rush towards start-up nirvana. We also love the fact that Facelette makes use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot; title=&quot;GitHub&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; for code-hosting and collaboration as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; for Rails magic; both of which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer&quot;&gt;developer services&lt;/a&gt; we cover with our Domains for Apps offering. There&amp;#39;s a lot to be said for open technologies and communities. If you want to build and share an application widely we think it&amp;#39;s probably a good thing to take an open approach to doing business from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach humbly describes his project as a &amp;quot;dumb experiment&amp;quot;. Now he&amp;#39;s got reviewers and advertisers tripping over themselves to get on-board. Who knows if he will decide to turn Facelette into the next big thing. But who cares? The important thing is that he&amp;#39;s having a lot of fun and doing something he&amp;#39;s really passionate about. #like&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tell Us Your Tumblr Tales</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Owning a personal or business related domain name is the first step to controlling your identity online. It also makes personally branded material more discoverable, reaching a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; is great blogging platform that lets you easily share stories, images and other digital content with the world. Everything about Tumblr makes setting up and managing a blog easy.  We now have a special custom domain promotion for both new and existing Tumblr users. Simply use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/tumblr&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and we will apply a 20% discount on your domain registration with iWantMyName.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-10-30-tumblr-domains-promo.png&quot; alt=&quot;tumblr-domains-promo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 good reasons why you should secure your own domain name for your Tumblr:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YourName.com is a shorter web address than &lt;code&gt;yourname.tumblr.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use custom email addresses &lt;code&gt;@yourname.com&lt;/code&gt; with your domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can keep the domain and switch to another service at any time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you to rank better in Google so that people can find you easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And last but not least - you have complete control of your domain name, it&amp;#39;s all yours!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With iWantMyName &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;web services&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s super easy to register your domain name and set it up for your Tumblr page. Feel free to share this Tumblr custom domain promotion with your friends. All they have to do is visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/tumblr&quot;&gt;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and they will get 20% off on any new domain registrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that domain-customising your tumble log literally only takes a few seconds to set up. Make sure you select &amp;quot;use a custom domain&amp;quot; option under the customize / info dropdown when you first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/register&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; for Tumblr. Enter your chosen domain name at this point. Then from within your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; dashboard simply click on &amp;quot;domains&amp;quot; then &amp;quot;install new service&amp;quot; to direct your domain to Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us your Tumblr tales in November and &lt;strong&gt;WIN&lt;/strong&gt; a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME domain&lt;/a&gt; for your new or existing Tumblr blog. Simply re-tweet or blog the short link for this article [see below] and we will put you in the prize draw and also share your Tumblr site with our followers.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SSL, Cookies and Caching</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we go again, the SSL topic is up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1827928&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and we couldn&amp;#39;t agree more! &lt;a href=&quot;http://codebutler.com/firesheep&quot;&gt;Firesheep&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful tool to play with and once again we are in the middle of the security versus performance discussion. Session hijacking is a serious threat, but whether or not it is a threat to you really depends heavily on the environment you operate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief issue with SSL is that today&amp;#39;s Javascript heavy pages load slowly because caching does not work under SSL. This brings down the performance significantly and may be a reason for those who don&amp;#39;t care about security to go elsewhere (and there are many who are willing to trade speed for security). A hybrid approach, involving loading the page itself in HTTPS and the Javascript and CSS files in HTTP, does not work either because it breaks the HTTPS browser security and confuses visitors more than it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this dilemma we decided that because we are in the fortunate situation that our customers are generally more of a tech savvy crowd - we can let them choose. If you are in the safe environment of your office, where you trust the ones who listen to your traffic, you may choose to trade security for speed and switch off the SSL protection for URLs that are considered safe. But if you are in a conference where normally some script kiddies listen to your traffic, it is a good idea to switch on the new session protection so that all traffic is SSL encrypted from the moment you log into our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does the standard SSL protection work on iWantMyName? We decided that some pages hold sensitive information and that we will only ever display them on HTTPS secured pages. However, others are not as sensitive and we display them on plain HTTP to gain some speed. All pages that handle passwords of any kind (including authorization codes for domain transfers) or billing information are secure, whereas others like your dashboard that only hold general information are served via HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this gives security for the individual pages it does not secure against session hijacking. To enable SSL for the entire time your session is authorized on our page we added a new switch. In your Dashboard under &amp;quot;Account -&amp;gt; Settings&amp;quot; is a switch for security settings. Enabling this switch will set your entire session to SSL irrespective of whether you are browsing our public website or looking at your credit card data. While this might slow down things a bit, it protects effectively against session hijacking and makes sure your domains are as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing you with this option we think that we can give you the flexibility to decide what level of security you need and then take the appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Registrar Storefront</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; we feel strongly that more innovation is needed within the global domain registrar industry. That&amp;#39;s why we developed our registrar platform from the ground up. Our philosophy revolves around providing a spam free, easy to use interface that doesn&amp;#39;t get in the way of the customer. Acquiring and managing domains shouldn&amp;#39;t be hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of customers worldwide already use our services and the number is growing daily. This extraordinary level of growth has encouraged us to continually add new features and to improve the existing technology. We launched sites in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinname.de/&quot;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://benikvrij.nl/&quot;&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; markets and new partners can roll out the platform in their own language within a few hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big opportunities that we see on the horizon is Internationalised Domain Names (IDN). This allows domain seekers to secure their digital identity using non-Latin character sets such as Arabic, Chinese or Cyrillic for example. Unlike many registrars, iWantMyName is already fully enabled for IDN. Want to allow your business customers to search for and register 新年快乐.com? No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sites have received &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;glowing reviews&lt;/a&gt; from many satisfied users all around the world. Now we are actively seeking &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/partner&quot;&gt;partnerships&lt;/a&gt; both in New Zealand and abroad. For bloggers and other high traffic sites we can offer a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/affiliate&quot;&gt;affiliate program&lt;/a&gt; that only takes minutes to set up. We pay you for any sales that are completed after click-throughs from your own website. The programme is managed by a completely independent service provider who works everything out and then sends you a cheque periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For technical deployments such as integrating our API, white label reseller solution or a tailor made site that reflects a particular language or cultural setting, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>All New DNS</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks we experienced some issues with our DNS manager. The result was that a small number of our customers could not update DNS records properly. For this we sincerely apologize. First our back end played up, later it was a problem with the user interface after we changed our website form framework. We should stress that the continuity of the DNS service was maintained at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing our website forms also resulted in some of your support inquiries not reaching us. So if you did not receive an email response to a support request within 24 hours, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;please re-submit your message&lt;/a&gt;. Again, we are sorry for this problem and the delay in getting back to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take our responsibilities to our customers very seriously, so we have made some changes to set things straight. We&amp;#39;ve now released a new iteration of our DNS manager and also switched to a more scalable back end. As a result, all domain registrations will use the following nameservers hostnames from now on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns1.iwantmyname.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns2.iwantmyname.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns3.iwantmyname.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns4.iwantmyname.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing domain names will be migrated to the new DNS infrastructure over the next few days without any service interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for your support and patience whilst we experienced these growing pains. Responding to feedback from our customers is how we improve, so please feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;yell at us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;drop us an email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;leave feedback&lt;/a&gt; if you encounter any problems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>88 Cool Domain Hacks Using The .GL TLD</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re big fans of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; at iWantMyName and would like to share a list of geeky short domains using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland&quot;&gt;Greenlandic domain extension&lt;/a&gt; with you today. The .GL domain suffix from Greenland is our newest ccTLD (country code top-level domain) available for registration and makes really cool domain hacks possible, with some of our staff favorites being bur.gl, don.gl, ille.gl, smug.gl, stran.gl, strug.gl or tog.gl.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Family Fun Forecast For Software Freedom Day</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are hugely pleased to be able to support &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwarefreedomday.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Software Freedom Day&lt;/a&gt; again this year. SFD aims to educate the public about the 
benefits of using high quality free and open source software in education, government, at 
home, and in business. As a business ourselves whose technical team are heavily involved in the open source developer community, we thought it highly appropriate to get involved. It&amp;#39;s great to see this event going from strength to strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be turning out at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.softwarefreedomday.org.nz/Wellington&quot;&gt;Wellington Software Freedom Day event&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday 19th September. The event is being held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Victoria+University+Pipitea+Campus&amp;amp;sll=-41.288255,174.777482&amp;amp;sspn=0.00732,0.021136&amp;amp;gl=nz&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=Victoria+University+Pipitea+Campus&amp;amp;hnear=&amp;amp;ll=-41.274678,174.778233&amp;amp;spn=0.013837,0.042272&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;iwloc=A&quot;&gt;Victoria University&amp;#39;s city campus &lt;/a&gt;next to the Wellington Railway Station. Look out for the iWantMyName banner and a big bowl of choccies. For fun we will also bring our QR code printer along. If you have a favourite web address, we are very happy to print off a free QR code sticker for you. Smartphone users snap the QR code image and go directly to your site. Incidentally, we provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code&quot;&gt;QR codes&lt;/a&gt; to all our customers through their individual domain management dashboard. It&amp;#39;s all part of the friendly service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software Freedom events around New Zealand are very much a family affair and there will be loads of fun activities, games and giveaways for kids. Come along and catch up with the iWantMyName crew or follow our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;live tweets&lt;/a&gt; on the day. We&amp;#39;d love to get your feedback on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone&quot;&gt;iPhone Domain App&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain registrar site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Vox.com Users: Now Is Your Chance To Upgrade To A Custom Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Six Apart announced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://closing.vox.com/&quot;&gt;shutdown of their free Vox.com blog service&lt;/a&gt;. One shortcoming of the system was the inability to use a custom domain name for a blog which means that users have no other choice than changing their web address should they decide to move to another service such as Six Apart&amp;#39;s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/typepad-professional-blog-service-dns-setup&quot;&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt;, newcomer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/posterous-blog-photos-mp3-video-by-email&quot;&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows again the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html&quot;&gt;having control over your web address&lt;/a&gt; with a custom domain name. Similar to phone numbers, domains can be transferred between providers (registrars) and more importantly you can point them to any &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;service of your liking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are a Vox.com user, before &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://closing.vox.com/en/move-to-posterous-or-wordpress.html&quot;&gt;migrating your blog to another service&lt;/a&gt; you should think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;buying your own domain name first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Free Online Brand Building Video Series From Loic Le Meur</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Online branding goes well beyond &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, they are an integral part of brand building and should be secured early on in the branding process. Entrepreneur &lt;a href=&quot;http://loiclemeur.com&quot;&gt;Loic Le Meur&lt;/a&gt; shares some useful advice in his video series on how to build your own brand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More episodes can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.buildyourownbrand.tv/&quot;&gt;BuildYourOwnBrand.tv&lt;/a&gt;, a great example for domain branding with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.TV web address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Where It&#39;s .AT</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-09-07-austria.png&quot; alt=&quot;austria&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month we launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria&quot;&gt;promotion for the .AT domain&lt;/a&gt;. For only $19 you can score a nifty domain that can offer many permutations for word play and domain hacks, especially in English. The .AT domain of Austria also has some quirky facts behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gre.at example of how to use this domain can be found .at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letseat.at/&quot;&gt;LetsEat&lt;/a&gt;. The site offers a website builder service specifically targeted .at restaurant owners. Once they sign up for the free service, users end up with a web address that looks like this: http://letseat.at/restaurantname. Incidentally there are many excellent free online services such as this available to help small businesses. In fact with iWantMyName &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;Domains for Apps&lt;/a&gt; we make it easy to domain customise a whole bunch of useful services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austria is a landlocked mountainous nation in central Europe with a population of 8.3 million. Bordering south-east Germany, but with its own distinct culture, Austria has one of the highest per capita incomes globally and an enviable standard of living. Obviously the world agrees th.at .AT is a useful domain too. There are well 
over 900,000 .AT domains registered globally. That&amp;#39;s about three times 
the size of the .NZ registry. The number of registered .AT domains is expected to reach 1 million around the end of this year. Germans own about 20% of all .AT domains, but the little Austrian town of Holzhausen (pop. 800) holds the record for the largest number of .AT domains per capita with over 1200 .AT domains registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;#39;s a good time to join in the fun with this month&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria&quot;&gt;huge price reduction&lt;/a&gt; on this popular and nimble domain.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Top 10 Domain Rankings 2010: .NET Soon To Be Second Largest Namespace?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The .NET domain extension might soon overtake Germany&amp;#39;s .DE as second largest top-level domain after the market leading .COM web address according to the latest domain name statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.COM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;88.7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;13.7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;13.3 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.UK&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;8.7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.ORG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;8.5 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.CN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.9 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.INFO&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;6.6 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;4.0 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.EU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;3.2 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.RU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;2.9 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hosterstats.com/DomainNameCounts2010.php&quot;&gt;Hoster Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting to see how some positions have changed in comparison to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&quot;&gt;top 10 domain name statistics from last year&lt;/a&gt;. While most domain extensions growing strongly, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/there-are-now-8-5-million-org-domains-and-growth-is-accelerating/&quot;&gt;.ORG grew from 7.7 to 8.5 million names&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese .CN suffix dropped from 2nd into 6th place after having changed the registration rules a few months back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another milestone for the domain name industry will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainincite.com/top-level-domain-count-likely-to-top-300-this-year/&quot;&gt;the passing of 300 domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; with the introduction of more internationalized country code domains. A number we will likely see increase over the coming years with the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html&quot;&gt;new top-level domains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Busted!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Our strategy of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; as a secondary support channel paid off at the weekend when our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;online support page&lt;/a&gt; threw a wobbly and crashed in a steaming heap of crud. Fortunately we received some tweet alerts from friends and were able to get cracking and sort out the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; we pride ourselves on providing a rapid response to service enquiries because it is one of the ways we can differentiate ourselves in the domain registrar marketplace. So we really appreciated that people were able to let us know about the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to report that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; is working again. During normal working hours we generally respond within two hours. At weekends or overnight you should receive a response within 24 hours. However if you posted a request over the weekend and feel that it has not yet been addressed, please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Simple Custom Domain Tweet Button With Bit.ly Pro</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bit.ly/post/1003484046/more-tips-for-using-bit-ly-with-publishing-tools&quot;&gt;tip on the bit.ly blog&lt;/a&gt; about how to use your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;custom short domain&lt;/a&gt; for link sharing via the Twitter Tweet Button in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&quot;&gt;bit.ly Pro&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For smaller publishers who cannot cache links on their backend, we are now providing a simple JavaScript wrapper for sharing bit.ly links using the Twitter Tweet Button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;https://api.bit.ly/v3/twitter&lt;em&gt;tweet&lt;/em&gt;button.js?login=bitlyapidemo&amp;amp;apiKey=R_0da49e0a9118ff35f52f629d2d71bf07&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://twitter.com/share&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;twitter-share-button&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tweet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to use your bit.ly login and API Key (which you can always find at http://www.bit.ly/a/your&lt;em&gt;api&lt;/em&gt;key) with the code above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implementation simply shortens the page URL and then displays the Twitter Tweet Button in its standard fashion. All Tweet Button functionality is maintained.  And, since our JavaScript wrapper uses your bit.ly login and API Key, it will automatically return custom bit.ly short domains for Pro and Enterprise users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a short domain name for your own URL shortener? These domain extensions allow &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;2-letter domain registration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>5 Personal Domain Extensions Other Than .COM</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you already own your name as a personal domain name? If not, is it because your FirstnameLastname.com was taken? That shouldn&amp;#39;t be a reason to dismiss the idea just yet! Today, we show you five great domain alternatives to .COM for your home base on the web:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. .ME Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-08-26-logo-dot-me-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;.me logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; has grown in popularity as a personal web address since its launch in 2008. It&amp;#39;s officially the country code top-level domain for Montenegro, but what could describe you better online than a nice sounding FirstnameLastname.me for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder&quot;&gt;your own website&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/customize-flavors.me-website-with-your-own-domain&quot;&gt;Flavors.me&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. .NAME Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-08-26-logo-dot-name-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;.name logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot;&gt;.NAME extension&lt;/a&gt; has existed since 2001 and was specifically introduced for individuals. Perfectly suited for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile&quot;&gt;personal site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting&quot;&gt;your own email address&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. hello@joesmith.name in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. .TEL Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-08-26-logo-dot-tel-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;.tel logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialized domain to store and share your contact details with others. All data is presented on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/03/your-tel-website-has-a-shiny-new-design.html&quot;&gt;easy and clean website&lt;/a&gt; that is included with every &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&quot;&gt;.TEL domain&lt;/a&gt; so you do not need to purchase any additional hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. .INFO Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-08-26-logo-dot-info-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;.info logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inform people about who you are. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;Register a .INFO domain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/04/10-most-popular-services-to-forward-your-domain-url-to.html&quot;&gt;forward it to other online profiles&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/wiki-hosting&quot;&gt;family wiki&lt;/a&gt; for example. Everything that contains information about you is a perfect fit for your personal .INFO web address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. .IM Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-08-26-logo-dot-im-domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;.im logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man&quot;&gt;Isle of Man&amp;#39;s domain suffix&lt;/a&gt; can be used as short form of &amp;quot;I am&amp;quot;. Many family names are still available so you could set up sub domains in the form joe.smith.im for family members. Another idea is to get a .IM domain as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener&quot;&gt;personal URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/free-hosting&quot;&gt;free services&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&quot;&gt;bit.ly Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/customize-droplr-with-your-own-domain&quot;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see it doesn&amp;#39;t always have to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, especially for your individual web presence. Of course you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;register the top-level domain from your country&lt;/a&gt; if you do not have any plans to go international with your personal brand. Some countries even have specialized web addresses for individuals such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.ME.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/geek.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.GEEK.NZ&lt;/a&gt; (New Zealand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing is to own your name online and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html&quot;&gt;not to rely on a third party web address&lt;/a&gt; such as facebook.com/username. Be creative in the choice of your personal domain name and check if it is still available with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Securing Your Domain Identity in China</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-08-20-prc.png&quot; alt=&quot;prc.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year the Chinese government instituted some law changes that led to .CN domain registrations by overseas registrars being blocked. For a period of time foreign individuals were effectively prevented from registering a domain name within China. For the time being this restriction has been lifted but extensive documentation is still required from foreign businesses before .CN domains are released. Unfortunately, as a result of these issues, we decided to remove the .CN domain extension from iWantMyName. However, China is a rapidly growing market and many New Zealand businesses now have extensive interests there. These companies should be considering how best to protect their identity online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other options available if you wish to secure a safe and recognisable domain identity in China or North Asia generally. We recommend registering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) or making use of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot;&gt;.ORG IDNs&lt;/a&gt; with Chinese characters instead. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pir.org/&quot;&gt;PIR&lt;/a&gt;, the registry for .ORG, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pir.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is now allowing IDNs with both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables/tables/cn_zh-cn_4.0.html&quot;&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables/tables/tw_zh-tw_4.0.html&quot;&gt;Traditional Chinese&lt;/a&gt; character sets. Another alternative is &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&quot;&gt;.CN.COM&lt;/a&gt;, a great domain for doing business in China. We are currently offering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&quot;&gt;massive discount&lt;/a&gt; to drive interest in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also strongly support .ASIA . This is a relatively new domain, so there are still many good names available. It is also very reasonably priced. Using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia&quot;&gt;.ASIA domain&lt;/a&gt; assists greatly with search engine ranking within the Asia region as well. All of the registries mentioned above operate outside of Mainland China and are not subject to the same constraints as .CN domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese character .ORG domains and most other Chinese character domains can be discovered and registered through our standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; which is already fully IDN enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/search?domain=%E7%89%9B+%E5%90%89&quot;&gt;an example of a search&lt;/a&gt; for a Chinese character domain.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why some domain extensions are more expensive than others</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When you have a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain price list&lt;/a&gt;, you will notice that some domain name extensions are more expensive than others. So why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three factors that determine our domain name pricing (apart from the fixed costs of running the business):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registry price&lt;/strong&gt; - this is the price a domain registrar is charged by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry&quot;&gt;registries&lt;/a&gt;. What you may not be aware of is that it is not us who are actually holding your domain name but a designated registry such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://verisign.com&quot;&gt;VeriSign&lt;/a&gt; (.COM/.NET), &lt;a href=&quot;http://pir.org&quot;&gt;PIR&lt;/a&gt; (.ORG), &lt;a href=&quot;http://nominet.org.uk&quot;&gt;Nominet&lt;/a&gt; (.UK) or &lt;a href=&quot;http://denic.de&quot;&gt;Denic&lt;/a&gt; (.DE). These registries charge a fee per domain to registrars which can vary considerably from one top-level domain to another. Ultimately, it is up to the registries how much they charge. This varies according to their operational cost, whether they are community-driven organizations or regulated by the government for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currency&lt;/strong&gt; - we usually buy domains in the local currency of a country. Most European country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are in Euro, while others are not part of the Eurozone e.g. Denmark uses Danish Crowns, the Czech Registry is paid in Czech Crowns, so they can all be subject to currency fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support cost&lt;/strong&gt; - some top-level domains have special registration procedures, for others you need to fulfill certain requirements for nameservers changes or whois contact updates, e.g. .EU domain updates are handled in a unique way. The world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;country code domains&lt;/a&gt; is full of exceptional cases which have to be factored as additional support cost into the yearly registration fee as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are a number of variables that influence the price for domains. We believe transparency is important, so we hope this article has given you some insight into &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain name pricing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland&quot;&gt;.GL Domains&lt;/a&gt; (from Greenland) are the latest &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; addition to the ever growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;list of TLDs&lt;/a&gt; (Top-Level Domains) available for registration at iWantMyName. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there are no restrictions or special requirements, anyone worldwide is permitted to register the .GL country domain.

&lt;p&gt;The internet extension of Greenland can be registered for $149.00 NZD. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland&quot;&gt;Secure your .GL domain now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internationalized Domain Names Launch in New Zealand</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.korero.maori.nz/news/mlw&quot;&gt;Māori Language Week&lt;/a&gt; begins in New Zealand, it is now possible to register &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;.NZ domain names&lt;/a&gt; with Macrons. The technology behind these new addresses are so-called Internationalized Domain Names (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name&quot; title=&quot;Internationalized domain name&quot;&gt;IDNs&lt;/a&gt;) which translate the special characters into a computer readable format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationalized Domain Names are available for all second-level .NZ domains available at iWantMyName: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.CO.NZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.NET.NZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.ORG.NZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/maori.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.MAORI.NZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/geek.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.GEEK.NZ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/school.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.SCHOOL.NZ&lt;/a&gt;. The new system makes it also possible to access domains under MĀORI.NZ so you can even enter a web address such as tēnākoe.māori.nz (note the ā in the second-level domain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the process. This is a significant step for Māori on the internet which began with the introduction of the .MAORI.NZ domain a few years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taiuru.maori.nz&quot;&gt;Karaitiana Taiuru&lt;/a&gt;, a leading advocate for the multi-lingual internat says that, other &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://blog.taiuru.maori.nz/2010/07/decade-of-advocating-for-maori.html&quot;&gt;milestones for the Māori language&lt;/a&gt; over the last 10 years have been the availability of Google, Microsoft Windows and many Open Source projects in Māori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NZ IDNs can be registered at an industry-low price of $19.00 USD (if you prefer to register your domains in Kiwi dollars, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&quot;&gt;iWantMyName NZ&lt;/a&gt;). So if you&amp;#39;re based in New Zealand you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;buy your Māori domain name&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Register .NZ Domain Names With Māori Macron Characters</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.korero.maori.nz/news/mlw&quot;&gt;Māori Language Week&lt;/a&gt; begins it is now possible to register .&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;NZ domain names&lt;/a&gt; with Macrons.

				<title>How To Use Descriptive Subdomains For Your Online Profiles</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we want to share with you a small branding advice that can be easily applied to your domain names and takes you only 2-3 minutes to set up. Subdomains such as blog.domainname.com or wiki.domainname.com are often used to map domain names to specific services but it&amp;#39;s also possible to simply forward them to another web address.
This is how the URL forwardings to your social network profiles could look like:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-07-24-blog-forward-social-usernames.png&quot; alt=&quot;blog-forward-social-usernames.png&quot;&gt;
For example, you can like iWantMyName on Facebook (please do!) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://like.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;like.iwantmyname.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or follow us on Twitter via &lt;a href=&quot;http://follow.iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;follow.iwantmyname.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So should your preferred social network change back to MySpace or Twitter be renamed to Twoogle you don&amp;#39;t have to adjust all your links except the new target web address for the subdomains. This makes your link branding completely third-party independent since you have full control over your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;own domain name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tech Behind The Scenes: CouchDB Case Study</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-07-22-Couchdb-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apache CouchDB logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://couch.io&quot;&gt;Couch.io&lt;/a&gt; for publishing their case study about &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.couch.io/case-study-iwantmyname&quot;&gt;CouchDB at iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;. We started using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://couchdb.apache.org/&quot;&gt;NoSQL database&lt;/a&gt; mainly for serving content but meanwhile switched nearly all site functionality from PostgreSQL to CouchDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, recently our shopping cart got replaced with a simple map/reduce based CouchDB solution that only needs some small glue and interface code. Before, it used to be a quite complex piece of code and database magic so for us the transition from traditional software design to a document based approach was mainly getting rid of heaps of code and logic.
If you&amp;#39;re a techie, you should read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.couch.io/case-study-iwantmyname&quot;&gt;iWantMyName case study on Couch.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New: .CO Domain Name Registration (Colombia)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now register &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;.CO domains (Colombia)&lt;/a&gt; at iWantMyName. The .CO extension is not only the official Colombian country code top-level domain (ccTLD) but also a shorter alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; or other ccTLDs such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.CO.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.CO.NZ&lt;/a&gt; (New Zealand). New domain name registrations are available at an affordable price of $34.90 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can .CO stand for? Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Cooperation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also follow Twitter&amp;#39;s example which registered the t.co domain name for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener&quot;&gt;own URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; or have a look at the following lists with domains to get an idea of what&amp;#39;s still available after the initial Sunrise and Landrush registration phase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2010/07/18/265-co-domains-that-werent-registered-in-landrush/&quot;&gt;265 .Co Domains That Weren&amp;#39;t Registered in Landrush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.dotsauce.com/2010/07/18/us-cities-over-100000-population/&quot;&gt;233 U.S. Cities Over 100,000 Population Available to Register As .CO Domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there&amp;#39;s one or the other neat domain hack that&amp;#39;s interesting for you too: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/co/&quot;&gt;words ending with &amp;#39;co&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, many opportunities are still out there, so don&amp;#39;t wait too long (the best ones are going fast) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;register your own .CO domain&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.CO Launches</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now register
&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt; .CO domains (Colombia)&lt;/a&gt; at iWantMyName. The .CO extension is not only 
the official Colombian country code top-level domain (ccTLD) but also a 
shorter alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; or other ccTLDs such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.CO.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United 
Kingdom) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.CO.NZ&lt;/a&gt; (New Zealand). New domain name registrations are 
available at an affordable price of $49.00&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can .CO 
stand for? Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooperation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You 
could also follow Twitter&amp;#39;s example which registered the t.co domain 
name for their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/url-shortener&quot;&gt;URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; or have a look at the following lists 
with domains that are still available after the initial Sunrise and 
Landrush registration phase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domainnamewire.com/2010/07/18/265-co-domains-that-werent-registered-in-landrush/&quot;&gt;233 U.S. Cities Over 100,000
Population Available to Register As .CO Domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there&amp;#39;s 
one or the other neat domain hack that&amp;#39;s interesting for you too: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/co/&quot;&gt;words 
ending with &amp;#39;co&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, many opportunities are still out
 there, so don&amp;#39;t wait too long (the best ones are going fast) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&quot;&gt;

				<title>Beer Necessities</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://brewersguild.org.nz/beervana2010&quot;&gt;Beervana Festival&lt;/a&gt; looming on the horizon we thought it timely to run another beer giveaway promotion through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;Twitter channel&lt;/a&gt;. Simply re-tweet the link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName blog&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;#39;ll be in the draw for another pack of delightful Mata Beer. At the end of Wednesday we will pull a winner out of the hat and then arrange to drop the beer off to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you don&amp;#39;t win the Mata Beer, you can still get along to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forum.realbeer.co.nz/events/west-coast-ipa-challenge&quot;&gt;West Coast IPA Challenge&lt;/a&gt; this weekend down at Wellington&amp;#39;s Malthouse in Courtenay Place. Since the Malthouse moved to their new digs the pub has emerged as the unofficial &amp;quot;party central&amp;quot; for local beer aficionados and connoisseurs. What better place to enjoy the hoppy delights of your favourite Kiwi made beers? Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mid-Winter Specials Already A Winner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;foul&lt;/strong&gt; weather may have scored an &lt;strong&gt;own goal&lt;/strong&gt; lately, but there&amp;#39;s no need to remain glum. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; our &lt;strong&gt;team&lt;/strong&gt; put their thinking hats on to see if we could come up with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;mid-winter specials&lt;/a&gt; to keep our friends and customers &lt;strong&gt;on side&lt;/strong&gt; and give mid-winter blues a &lt;strong&gt;red card&lt;/strong&gt;. Following on from the success of our Go .NZ! &lt;strong&gt;All Whites World Cup campaign&lt;/strong&gt; we decided to set all our .NZ domain prices at $25.90, marked down from $29. Because our &lt;strong&gt;goal&lt;/strong&gt; is to deliver great value, even at this price you still get all our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;free services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;thrown in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we thought, why stop there? With our marketing &lt;strong&gt;manager&lt;/strong&gt; out of town &lt;strong&gt;on tour&lt;/strong&gt; we figured now is a great time to &lt;strong&gt;tackle&lt;/strong&gt; prices on some other popular lines, to prove we can foot it with the other &lt;strong&gt;players&lt;/strong&gt; out there. These promo prices &lt;strong&gt;kick off&lt;/strong&gt; immediately and will remain &lt;strong&gt;on side&lt;/strong&gt; until July 31st. Avoid the &lt;strong&gt;penalties&lt;/strong&gt; imposed by other registrars and &lt;strong&gt;score&lt;/strong&gt; some great winter specials. Of course if you already own a cool domain you can take advantage of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;great &lt;strong&gt;transfer&lt;/strong&gt; offer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve &lt;strong&gt;booted&lt;/strong&gt; a massive 63% off &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&quot;&gt;.TV domains&lt;/a&gt;, making them available at $29, you &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; $50! If you are setting up a mobile site or just want to add some &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/mobi-domain-name-registration-for-mobile&quot;&gt;.MOBI domains&lt;/a&gt; to your portfolio then check out savings of up to 48%. There are also huge reductions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man&quot;&gt;.IM&lt;/a&gt; domains. We won&amp;#39;t be giving these bargains any &lt;strong&gt;extra time&lt;/strong&gt; so make sure you get in before the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domains On Your iPhone</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you been out somewhere or chatting to friends when a great idea for a domain name popped into your head? With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone&quot;&gt;iWantMyName DomainApp&lt;/a&gt; you can search for and register domains from your iPhone anywhere, anytime. It&amp;#39;s a great free tool that has had thousands of downloads and some great reviews since we first launched iWantMyName globally. DomainApp even got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2009/03/26/iphone-job-search-apps/&quot;&gt;nice mention on Mashable&lt;/a&gt; last year as a &amp;#39;must have&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With millions of Apple iPhone 4 flying out the door now, the market for mobile search and registration can only grow. Incidently &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; looks great on the iPad too. We&amp;#39;ve designed the DomainApp so that it interacts with the iWantMyName platform in a swift and seamless fashion and offer customers a much nicer way to handle domain registration. So next time you are hatching a plan for your next big web project over a couple of beers, there is no excuse for not securing the domain you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-06-15-tel-domain-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;tel-domain-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting on June 15, you will be able to register &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&quot;&gt;.TEL domains&lt;/a&gt; in the following languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chinese, Danish, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.TEL is the domain for all contact information under your name. It&amp;#39;s perfect for both individuals and small businesses to quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/03/your-tel-website-has-a-shiny-new-design.html&quot;&gt;set up a simple website&lt;/a&gt; without the need to buy any additional web hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.CO - the Colombian country code extension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-06-15-co-domain-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;co-domain-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top-level domain (TLD) of Colombia is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cointernet.co/domain/launch/general-availability&quot;&gt;opening up to anyone worldwide&lt;/a&gt; on July 20, 2010. While the registry &lt;a href=&quot;http://cointernet.co&quot;&gt;.CO Internet&lt;/a&gt; is marketing the TLD as a domain extension for general use, you should be aware that it is in fact a country code suffix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information on pricing at iWantMyName will be available shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Go .NZ!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Football World Cup event is a wonderful spectacle that both our Kiwi and German 
founders are enjoying. New Zealand team The All Whites play Slovakia tonight at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Cup&quot;&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa in a match that is sure to be full of passion. For New Zealand it will be their first appearance at the event since 1982. For Slovakia it will be their first outing as an independent nation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate The All Whites kicking off in their first World Cup clash we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;special offer running on some .nz domains&lt;/a&gt; throughout June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;Grab yourself a .co.nz, .net.nz or .org.nz domain&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;only $22.90&lt;/strong&gt; saving a whopping 21% on the regular price. And remember - you still get access to all our free services through your neat domain management interface at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;. Save on software, hosting and updates by utilising a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory&quot;&gt;huge range of web apps&lt;/a&gt; such as GMail, Google Docs and Blogger and let us hook the whole lot up to your own chosen domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which team you are supporting during the World Cup, it makes great sense from a productivity point of view to make use of all the cool web &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; on offer out there. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions#co.nz-new%20zealand&quot;&gt;.nz specials&lt;/a&gt; make it even more worthwhile. Go .NZ!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bugger.me</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been having some fun today playing with the search settings at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting how language changes over the years and Kiwi English is no exception. Words that might have been unacceptable or uncommon twenty years ago sometimes end up becoming the norm. A certain fruity term received a boost a few years ago with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R1JOcl0VlA&quot;&gt;controversial TV ad&lt;/a&gt; aimed at selling Toyota trucks to farmers. In fact the moral outrage that ensued probably caused the phrase to be cemented as part of our Kiwi lexicon, rather than discouraging its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be very frustrating when you dream up a brilliant new web address
 only to discover that someone already secured it. We empathise with your
 disappointment so we changed our search response to reflect 
accordingly. For example if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/search?domain=allwhites&quot;&gt;search for 
&amp;quot;All Whites&amp;quot; related domains&lt;/a&gt; - see what happens. And speaking of All Whites, keep an eye on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz&quot;&gt;twitter channel&lt;/a&gt; for some special deals during the Football World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cheers! Tasty Tweets for Kiwis</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no question that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier and faster to register and manage domain names in New Zealand. Now we are making it easy to win some delicious New Zealand brewed boutique product from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mata.net.nz/&quot;&gt;Mata Beer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName is a global registrar platform technology also created right here in New Zealand. We&amp;#39;ve been quite chuffed with the enthusiastic response we&amp;#39;ve had from our Kiwi customers, so we thought we would give something back. Because we are a Kiwi-German team and are discerning about what we drink, we selected the delicious Mata Artesian German style lager to give away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;New Zealand blog&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to give feedback and to keep in touch with new services on the site. If you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and then re-tweet our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&quot;&gt;blog url&lt;/a&gt; during Wednesday 2nd of June, you will go in the draw for a pack of Mata Artesian. Winners announced at 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kiwi Schools Make Savings With Web Apps</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently implemented the &lt;strong&gt;.school.nz&lt;/strong&gt; domain on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; platform and it&amp;#39;s great to see some Kiwi schools have quickly identified the cost saving benefits. iWantMyName offers a unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;web apps customisation service&lt;/a&gt; that allows organisations and individuals to operate a wide range of popular web-based enterprise applications entirely within their own domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now schools can benefit from major productivity gains associated with utilising free or low cost web apps such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder&quot;&gt;website builders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting&quot;&gt;webmail&lt;/a&gt;, whilst protecting their brand identity online. Using web apps means fewer software overheads, better security and less maintenance for school I.T. administrators. For schools that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/school.nz-domain-registrar-transfer-new-zealand&quot;&gt;transfer&lt;/a&gt; across their existing domain there is a free one year extension.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Improved Web Application Setup &amp; New DNS Manager</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve recently released major upgrades to our dashboard which dramatically improve the setup and management of your domain names. Hopefully this will make things even easier for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web application setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Simplifying DNS and Domain Management</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; we want to make it a lot easier to hook up your favourite web apps to your chosen domain. Our web app directory already contains &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory&quot;&gt;more than 30 services&lt;/a&gt; including the following categories: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder&quot;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/forum-hosting&quot;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting&quot;&gt;ecommerce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting&quot;&gt;portfolios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/social-network&quot;&gt;social networks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/url-shortener&quot;&gt;url shortener&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/wiki-hosting&quot;&gt;wikis&lt;/a&gt;. There is a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory&quot;&gt;overview page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all the available apps and services. In addition to the web apps we&amp;#39;ve also provided additional documentation and information within the user dashboard to assist with more specific custom domain mapping of your favourite service. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin&quot;&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt; and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these major upgrades to the dashboard we&amp;#39;ve made it a whole lot easier, not only for website administrators, developers or sys admins who require greater control over domain set-up, but also for users with a non-technical background. These changes are intended to dramatically improve the ability of our customers to manage their domain names and personalise services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-05-19-services-setup1-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;services setup&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS management tool has been completely re-written and is available from the dashboard when logged in. It offers an easy-peasy way to handle domain set-ups in more detail. Let us know if you have any troubles using it - we always love to get feedback so we can further improve the iWantMyName platform. There are some big future plans for DNS management on the site, which will be especially interesting for developers. We will let you know, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kiwi Born iWantMyName Returns From Big O.E.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName is the world&amp;#39;s most innovative domain registrar platform and was developed by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideegeo.com&quot;&gt;parent company&lt;/a&gt; based right here in Wellington, New Zealand. With a new wave of web-based ventures emerging on the New Zealand tech scene and a paradigm shift underway in the way we access distributed computing services globally, it seems like a good time to introduce our domain registrar platform to our home audience.
We first launched iWantMyName into the U.S. market at the end of 2008 with the aim of satisfying a growing demand from customers for a cleaner, quicker way to register domains. As we anticipated, there was an enthusiastic uptake, especially from the web developer and designer community who immediately grasped the benefits of a much more user-friendly interface. Our offer of some free services not provided by many of the big domain registrars sealed the deal in the minds of many.
During 2009 we were hard at work listening to our users, refining the platform technology and looking into other markets. We were soon approached by a partner in the Netherlands who had an existing hosting business and was keen to set up a Dutch language version of the site on a license basis. A German version of iWantMyName followed shortly afterwards. With sites operating successfully in three of the largest global markets for domains, it was time to refocus our attention on the local market.
A lot of our Kiwi friends had begun to discover iWantMyName offshore and we had received an increasing number of requests for a New Zealand dollar denominated site. Like many Kiwis that venture offshore, it was time for iWantMyName to return home. The January Linux Conference proved to be the perfect opportunity to launch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&quot;&gt;New Zealand version of iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; and to get some nice feedback from actual users who visited our trade stand at the event.
If you have already used the NZ site - thank-you for supporting a local business! If you only just heard about us, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin&quot;&gt;try a free account&lt;/a&gt; and check out our current &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domain-promo-nz&quot;&gt;special offers&lt;/a&gt;. You can even be our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/iWantMyName-NZ/118040718222943?ref=ts&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; friend - we love feedback! Remember we have New Zealand&amp;#39;s largest range of domain extensions by far and lightning fast customer support that the big guys can only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internationalized Domain Name Extensions Are Coming Soon [VIDEO]</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;CNN Live News interview with Tina Dam from ICANN on topic of new Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) suffixes. The new development results in domain extensions such as .CN (China) or .GR (Greece) being available for users, expressed in their native languages and scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgQ16Bwj3sw&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following internationalized country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) have already been approved by ICANN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  United Arab Emirates (ae): .امارات&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  China (cn): .中國 (traditional); .中国 (simplified)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Egypt (eg): .مصر&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Hong Kong (hk): .香港&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Jordan (.jo): .الاردن&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Sri Lanka (lk): .ලංකා (Sinhalese); .இலங்கை (Tamil)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;  Thailand (th): .ไทย&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tunisia (tn): .تونس&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Become An iWantMyName Language Partner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Much of our time in 2009 was spent on refining our domain management service to make it more attractive to partners around the globe. Consequently we launched a Dutch language partner site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://benikvrij.nl&quot;&gt;Benikvrij&lt;/a&gt; and a German site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinname.com&quot;&gt;meinName&lt;/a&gt;. We also designed a system that means we can roll out a new implementation of the iWantMyName platform within a few days and scale up rapidly as customer demand grows. We provide our partner companies with a complete set of front end templates and they make the necessary translation into their home language. Of course we handle the billing set-up including whatever currency is required and make it compatible with any existing systems. You are also free in the choice of any domain registrar back end on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ICANN moving steadily towards full implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), it is encouraging to know that we have already invested in a fully IDN capable system. The Russian and Arabic language domain name space looks set to heat up for this reason very soon. But we also see great opportunities in parts of Asia such as Japan and Korea where high average incomes and heavy internet usage combine to present an attractive proposition for a niche registrar player. South America looks like an interesting story as well. With an increasingly affluent middle class population and a highly developed mobile internet infrastructure, we&amp;#39;d love to see a Spanish or Portuguese language version of iWantMyName in that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that users all around the world will continue to demand a better experience when it comes to domain registration and management and we believe that iWantMyName provides a unique, easy-to-use package that helps domain registrars and resellers to grow market share. In particular our innovative &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;web app domain customization service&lt;/a&gt; gives registrars a competitive advantage. Therefore we are now inviting expressions of interest from companies interested in deploying a customized version of iWantMyName in a foreign language market to meet the needs of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to discuss a partnership opportunity further, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:timo@ideegeo.com&quot;&gt;timo@ideegeo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>3 Awesomely Simple Tumblr Themes Designed by Jarred Bishop</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not often that you meet talented people with an eye for real simple designs. We were lucky to catch up with one of them last week. Local designer &lt;a href=&quot;http://jarredbishop.info&quot;&gt;Jarred Bishop&lt;/a&gt; developed three custom Tumblr themes and his &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/theme/8948&quot;&gt;Wordographic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; theme was selected by Tumblr as one of the few templates available in their new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/themes/premium&quot;&gt;premium theme garden&lt;/a&gt;. Jarred also told us that he&amp;#39;s got other themes cooking so stay tuned for more excellent customization options (besides &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;your own domain name&lt;/a&gt;) for your blog or portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>10 Most Popular Services To Forward Your Domain To</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Domain name redirection or web (URL) forwarding is one of the easiest ways to start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;your own web address&lt;/a&gt; and is a service we provide free to all customers at iWantMyName. With this option you can forward domains to any other public location on the internet. Although it shouldn&amp;#39;t be the preferred setup, it makes perfect sense under some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would you choose to redirect a domain name? First, some web services do not support &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;custom domains&lt;/a&gt; but only offer to get a username tied to their web address in the form of &lt;em&gt;domain.com/username&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. &lt;em&gt;twitter.com/username&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;facebook.com/username&lt;/em&gt;. In this case forwarding is the only option to point a domain to the respective site. Secondly, a redirection comes in handy if you haven&amp;#39;t decided what to do with a new internet address yet. By forwarding a domain, you could let all visitors go to a Facebook page or LinkedIn profile instead of presenting them with a blank site or an error message in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s our top 10 list of services to forward to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; profile / page -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://facebook.com/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; _https://twitter.com/username _&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://linkedin.com&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; http://linkedin.com/in/username&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://profiles.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Profiles&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://profiles.google.com/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; fotos -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://flickr.com/photos/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; videos -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://youtube.com/user/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; videos -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://vimeo.com/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://last.fm&quot;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; music -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://last.fm/user/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://myspace.com&quot;&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://myspace.com/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://identi.ca&quot;&gt;Identi.ca&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;http://identi.ca/username&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides linking your domain to only one of the mentioned services, you could also create your own namespace like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/status&lt;/em&gt; - forward to Twitter or Identi.ca
&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/profile&lt;/em&gt; - forward to LinkedIn or Google Profiles
&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/video&lt;/em&gt; - forward to Youtube or Vimeo
&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/music&lt;/em&gt; - forward to Last.fm or MySpace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the drift... only by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;owning a domain name&lt;/a&gt; and having control over the full web address, are you actually able to change the destination at any point in time. Don&amp;#39;t like Twitter anymore? Simply change &lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/status&lt;/em&gt; to another service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up free domain forwarding through your domain management interface at iWantMyName.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using A Custom Domain Can Boost Your Website Traffic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Two of the services recommended in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;web application directory&lt;/a&gt; offer some valuable insights on how using your own domain name, instead of a sub-domain, can boost your website traffic and / or increase sales. But this is not the only advantage. With a custom domain you also have ownership and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html&quot;&gt;control over your online identity&lt;/a&gt; so that if necessary you could move from one service to another, whilst retaining your branding. On top of that, you can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;change your domain name provider&lt;/a&gt; and take your web address with you similar to switching your number between mobile phone companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what hosted e-commerce solution &lt;a href=&quot;http://shopify.com&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; and social network hosting service &lt;a href=&quot;http://grou.ps&quot;&gt;grou.ps&lt;/a&gt; are saying about using custom domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Choose a good domain name for your store. Having your own domain rather than using the subdomain supplied with your store adds credibility and professionalism. Choosing a good name can also increase visitors to your store. When I registered DrChristophersHerbs.com I saw an increase in sales due to the keyword density of the name itself. In fact, 66.74% of my traffic comes from search engines, most of them searching for &amp;quot;dr christophers herbs&amp;quot; which corresponds with my domain name. - Addison Kirk of DrChristophersHerbs.com&amp;quot; - via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.shopify.com/2010/3/15/two-greats-tips-from-store-owners&quot;&gt;Shopify blog&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;quot;Fact: our custom domain users generate 4x more traffic than our users who are use the grou.ps domain name.&amp;quot; - via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grou_ps/status/10503117650&quot;&gt;@grou_ps Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are serious about your online presence, it clearly makes sense to invest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;your own web address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Your .TEL Domain&#39;s Website Has A Shiny New Design</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&quot;&gt;.TEL top-level domain&lt;/a&gt;, an easy way to publish contact information online, has just released a new design for all users. Your domain name&amp;#39;s website can now be customized with different color schemes and your personal avatar, photo or logo. If you enter links to your Twitter, Facebook profile or other services it also shows custom icons when your .TEL page is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how our company .TEL website &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideegeo.tel&quot;&gt;ideegeo.tel&lt;/a&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ideegeo.tel&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-03-12-ideegeo-tel-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;ideegeo.tel&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.TEL is a simple and affordable solution to own and manage a website without the need of having additional webhosting. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/03/mytel-iphone-app-now-integrates-with-domainapp.html&quot;&gt;update your contact information and location from your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. The new design and personalization options make .TEL pages much more interesting for both individuals and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if your personal or company name is still available with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>China Domain Name Alternatives, Part 2: .ASIA</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The saga around China domain names continues with this week&amp;#39;s rumour that every .CN website owner may have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stephanevangelder.com/archives/308-Chinese-authorities-want-to-meet-every-new-.CN-website-owner-in-person!.html&quot;&gt;apply in person for a web address&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily there is another unrestricted alternative, in addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&quot;&gt;.CN.COM&lt;/a&gt;, suitable for the Chinese market: the generic .ASIA top-level domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5 reasons why you should consider .ASIA for your website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  .ASIA is governed by international authorities outside of China. It provides security, stability and is used and commonly known for the Asian region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A .ASIA domain can be registered by anybody, quickly and easily without the hassle of documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Asia is the market of tomorrow. Did you know, that .ASIA domains can improve the search engine ranking for queries relevant to the Asian market? The term &amp;quot;asia&amp;quot; itself is already one of the most popular search keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The .ASIA namespace is still young so the chances of getting your desired domain name beneath .ASIA are more likely than in the .COM or .NET extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  .ASIA registrations help fund community work in the Asian region such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://relief.asia&quot;&gt;Relief.asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://isif.asia&quot;&gt;ISIF.asia&lt;/a&gt; (R&amp;amp;D Grants Fund), &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://creativecommons.asia&quot;&gt;CreativeCommons.asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://olpc.asia&quot;&gt;OLPC.asia&lt;/a&gt; (One-Laptop-Per-Child initiative in Asia).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to our special offer for .CN.COM domains, we will also run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-promos&quot;&gt;promotion for the .ASIA extension&lt;/a&gt;. All new registrations will only be $14.90 USD from March 1st, 2010. Go and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;get your .ASIA domain now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>China Domain Name Alternatives, Part 1: .CN.COM</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Registering a domain name under the official China country code top-level domain (ccTLD) .CN will not get easier anytime soon. Latest news is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9155358/China_s_.cn_cleanup_shows_politics_behind_Web_rules&quot;&gt;.CN registry has employed 600 workers&lt;/a&gt; to manually check all domain registrations for policy violations such as pornographic content and inaccurate records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, we have decided not to offer .CN domains as long as any restrictions are in place. However, if China is your destination market, we would like to suggest two alternative solutions: .CN.COM and .ASIA web addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.CN.COM: An unrestricted domain extension for China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative .CN.COM internet extension is managed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://centralnic.com&quot;&gt;CentralNic&lt;/a&gt;, the registry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-domain-name-registration-for-lao-peoples-democratic-republic&quot;&gt;.LA (Laos)&lt;/a&gt; and many other popular second-level domain suffixes such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu.com-domain-name-registration-for-european-union&quot;&gt;.EU.COM (European Union)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us.com-american-domain-name-registration-for-united-states-of-america&quot;&gt;.US.COM (United States)&lt;/a&gt;. Domains under .CN.COM are completely unrestricted, enabled for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), including Chinese character sets, and can be registered by anybody worldwide. This makes it the perfect web address if you do not want a domain name that is heavily regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now enabled .CN.COM at iWantMyName with a special introductory offer. All new registrations are only $19.90 USD until the end of April. Please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-promo&quot;&gt;domain promotions&lt;/a&gt; for further details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our next article about .CN domain alternatives we will talk about .ASIA, the new generic top-level domain (gTLD) for the Asian community.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Your Username Does Not Belong To You</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The widely &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumbledore.tumblr.com/post/393030100/tumblr-stole-my-domain-at-the-behest-of-a-corporation&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; recent case of a Tumblr user summarily losing control of a sub-domain and related blog has fanned the flames of discontent amongst users of hosted applications worldwide. The rumblings emerged again last year with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/23/facebook-gives-harman-his-name-back-apologizes/&quot;&gt;Facebook&amp;#39;s back down&lt;/a&gt; in the face of a user revolt. The more recent Tumblr case also reinvigorates the debate over the subtle difference between a name squat and genuine usage. In any event this incident reminds us exactly how frail the laws of ownership seem to be across the nebulous world of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it be Facebook, Twitter, Ning or any other service provider, they all have a point in common. You cannot own a web address such as http://facebook.com/yourusername or http://yourusername.tumblr.com because it is tied to THEIR domain name. If the domain (or company) fails for some reason you are not in control of your user-name and your content. Folks invest a lot of time building their online content and a deletion can be horrifying. So how does one go about protecting digital identity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domain name system (DNS) was invented in 1983 and .COM celebrates its &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://25yearsof.com&quot;&gt;25th birthday&lt;/a&gt; this year. By 2012 there will be over 200 million domain names in use. Despite its age the DNS continues to provide reliable service to domain owners who enjoy complete control over how they use and manage their own domains. Unlike usernames, a domain is a secure asset whose operation is governed by a universal set of rules that registrars must operate within. The rules not only protect ownership, but also allow for full portability. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer to a better registrar&lt;/a&gt; at any time and you can redirect your domain to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services&quot;&gt;any online service&lt;/a&gt; that you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You don&amp;#39;t control your username...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-02-19-username-facebook.png&quot; alt=&quot;username-facebook.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;...but you can control your own domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2010-02-19-domainname-dns.png&quot; alt=&quot;domainname-dns.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the full implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot;&gt;internationalized domain names (IDNs)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html&quot;&gt;introduction of new top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; the diversity of available domain branding options will continue to grow. Many companies keep a small portfolio of branded domains for future use and to protect their digital identity from being misused. Under the domain industry rules a user may secure their personal domain without any obligation to apply it immediately. If an ownership dispute arises, there are rules governing this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think your preferred user name might be controversial, at risk or already taken, why not choose a more generic name and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;register a domain&lt;/a&gt; to control your digital identity instead?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Short URL Domain Name Ideas for Customizing bit.ly Pro</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Popular URL shortening service &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly&quot; title=&quot;bit.ly&quot;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; is launching an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bit.ly/post/356400453/bit-ly-pro-open-beta-and-enterprise-service&quot; title=&quot;bit.ly Pro open beta&quot;&gt;open beta&lt;/a&gt; of its long-awaited Pro version with custom domain option soon. This will allow you to use your own domain name for a personally branded URL instead of the standard shortened addresses starting with bit.ly or j.mp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  bit.ly Pro is completely free and has the following features included:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  10,000 requests / day for your custom short URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Access to the bit.ly Pro dashboard with detailed statistics on your branded links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  bit.ly button to allow users share links on Twitter / Facebook with your custom domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be an Enterprise edition with support for multiple domains, advanced dashboard features, full end-to-end branding and a customer service support plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Short URL Domain Name Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some domain name ideas for you to find a memorable short domain. You should try to keep it simple yet still readable. Do not obsess to much about the length, 5-7 characters will still work fine. It is not so much the brevity that is important but the recognition value of your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Use abbreviations / misspellings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- Company: comp or cmpny
- YourDesignBlog: yodebl or yrdsgn
- iWantMyName: iwmn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Play with initials:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- FirstnameLastname: FL or FiLa
- New York Agency: NYA
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Find a domain hack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- iPeople: ipeo.pl
- Youtube: youtu.be
- YourName: yrna.me (domain hack / misspelling combined)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Register a boutique domain extension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) (It&amp;#39;s me...)
- [.IM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man) (I&amp;#39;m)

- [.TW](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tw-taiwanese-domain-name-registration-for-taiwan) (for Twitter!)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

				<title>.LU (Luxembourg) Opens Up Its Domain Extension To The World</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As of February 1, 2010, it will be possible to register the Luxembourgish .LU domain name extension without a local address in Luxembourg. This means that anyone worldwide can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lu-luxembourgian-domain-name-registration-for-luxembourg&quot;&gt;register .LU domains&lt;/a&gt; for personal or business use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new rule allows us to reduce the price for our valued customers. All new domain registrations and renewals will be reduced from $59.00 to $49.00 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .LU registry also announced the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot;&gt;Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)&lt;/a&gt; starting in April. More details on this coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.ORG Chinese Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) Available Shortly</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have heard, China recently changed the rules for .CN domain registrations blocking overseas registrars, excluding individuals from registering a domain name and requiring extensive documentation from businesses before domains are accepted. Thus, we have removed the .CN domain extension from our website completely until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to secure your online identity in China, we recommend registering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) or soon to be available &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot;&gt;.ORG IDNs&lt;/a&gt; with Chinese characters instead. The registry for .ORG, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pir.org&quot;&gt;PIR&lt;/a&gt;, is allowing IDNs with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables/tables/cn_zh-cn_4.0.html&quot;&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables/tables/tw_zh-tw_4.0.html&quot;&gt;Traditional Chinese&lt;/a&gt; character sets from January 23rd 2010, 19:00 UTC. Please note that .ORG Chinese IDNs registered in the first 30 days, will have restriction placed upon them by the registry to allow for intellectual property interests to file UDRP actions if warranted. You will not be able to delete, transfer or update a domain during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese character .ORG domains can be registered through our standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; which is already fully IDN enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;中文国际域名 (IDNs) .ORG 很快开放&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;中国当局最近更改了.CN 域名注册规则。由于这些变更我们不得不暂时将 .CN 域名从我们的网站上移除。但是，如果阁下希望确保您在中国的在线身份，我们建议阁下用中文汉字注册 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; 域名。同时 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt; 域名也将作为国际域名 (IDN) 很快开放。敦请阁下注意，中文 IDNs 的 .ORG 域名自注册之日起30天内会受到限制。期间您将无法删除，传输或者上传。中文汉字域名 .ORG 可以通过我们的带有完整 IDN 功能的标准域名搜索来注册。例如 阳光.org&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Download The QR Code For Your Domain Name</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now download an auto-generated QR code for every domain name in your iWantMyName dashboard. QR codes or 2D barcodes are square images that can contain different data, e.g. URLs, an email address or phone numbers. The &amp;quot;QR&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;Quick Response&amp;quot; and was created by Japanese corporation Denso-Wave in 1994. They are very common in Japan already but start gaining popularity in the western world as well with the wide adoption of the iPhone and Android-powered mobile camera phones such as Google&amp;#39;s Nexus One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your domain QR code can be obtained by clicking on the respective domain name in the iWantMyName dashboard. Feel free to download, print or put it on a sticker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many use cases for QR codes. One of our favorite blogs ReadWriteWeb had an excellent article series on &amp;quot;The Scannable World&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iWantMyName crew will be at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lca2010.org.nz&quot;&gt;LCA2010 Open Day&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 23rd January at the Wellington Town Hall. Be sure to stop by our booth, supply us with your favourite URL address and we will print a free QR code sticker for you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Supporting Open Source at</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After a very wet and stormy weekend here in Wellington it was with a palpable sense of relief that the heavens parted and sunshine once again blessed the city as delegates filed into the Convention Centre for the opening of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lca2010.org.nz/&quot;&gt;Australasian Linux Conference LCA2010&lt;/a&gt;. As locally based event co-sponsors, we are especially keen for visiting delegates to enjoy a taste of the natural environment in our scenic hometown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is a commercial developer of domain registrar software supporting an open source event? Perhaps that question is best answered by our chief technologist Lenz Gschwendtner who will be speaking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://multicorenz.wordpress.com/lca2010-miniconf/&quot;&gt;LCA Miniconf on Parallel Computing&lt;/a&gt; 10.30am Tuesday 18th January. Lenz recently wrote an article explaining how we managed to roll out the iWantMyName platform into &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://norbu09.org/2010/01/15/3-new-destination-markets-in-some-weeks.html&quot;&gt;three new destination markets&lt;/a&gt; in the short space of just a few weeks. Being a modular platform, we make use of some fantastic open source projects (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://couchdb.apache.org/&quot;&gt;CouchDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rabbitmq.com/&quot;&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalystframework.org/&quot;&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;) to implement and run the system. But we also give back to the community, by adding various source libraries to CPAN and &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/norbu09&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as we extend our skill set and progressively develop the platform further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business of open source is an important theme that cuts across the entire conference this year and that is another reason why iWantMyName is supporting this event. We think it&amp;#39;s cool that the acceptance of open source technology is growing across business and government in Australia and New Zealand. Not only will it lead to greater business productivity, but it will almost certainly allow much greater innovation and diversity as developer communities flourish. In fact our parent company ideegeo set up an &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/erlounge-wellington&quot;&gt;Erlang user group&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 and we are very active in other ICT groups around Wellington. No doubt many new ideas will be born in the conference hallways this week as various global communities come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help these ideas along we are running some great offers on our newly launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&quot;&gt;Kiwi iWantMyName site&lt;/a&gt;. Of course we have a great deal for our homegrown and much loved &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/geek.nz-geeky-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.geek.nz&lt;/a&gt; domain or if you need a domain for a community project, check out what we can offer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand&quot;&gt;.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; domains. For perl hackers we offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/pl-polish-domain-name-registration-for-poland&quot;&gt;.pl&lt;/a&gt; and for the enthusiasts amongst you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&quot;&gt;.io&lt;/a&gt; (input/output) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/sh-domain-name-registration-for-saint-helena&quot;&gt;.sh&lt;/a&gt; (shell). Use our domain search to run a name check on over 80 different &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&quot;&gt;domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; - the best selection available by far Down Under. Then you can use our great management dashboard to hook your new domain up to any of the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;hosted services&lt;/a&gt; we feature such as GMail, Zoho and Blogger. Bingo! Your own customised office within a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very keen to get feedback on our site and meet some of our customers in person. So please look out for the big red and white iWantMyName banner at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lca2010.org.nz/programme/open_day&quot;&gt;LCA2010 Open Day&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. You can also find us at Monday evening&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://twtvite.com/n7asaf&quot;&gt;Tweetup at the Green Man pub&lt;/a&gt; or catch us on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ideegeo&quot;&gt;@ideegeo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwmn&quot;&gt;@iwmn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kiwi iWantMyName Domain Registrar Site Launches</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With the successful launch of iWantMyName as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;global domain registrar&lt;/a&gt; site and then into &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinname.com&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://benikvrij.nl&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; last year, we felt it was now time to turn our attention to home. We have had so many requests from our friends to establish in the New Zealand market, because of our unique service offering, friendly user interface and great customer support. Finally we had to say yes and we now have a dedicated Kiwi site at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&quot;&gt;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; offering fixed prices in New Zealand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kiwi iWantMyName has New Zealand&amp;#39;s widest range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&quot;&gt;domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are unavailable from other local domain registrars. Examples of exclusive domains include the recently launched .TEL and .ME suffixes plus interesting country code top-level domains from all over the world such as .LI (Liechtenstein), .IO (British Indian Ocean Territory) and .FM (Federal States of Micronesia). Customers from the existing site can use the same login details to access their accounts across the iWantMyName platform suite. We also offer the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&quot;&gt;free services&lt;/a&gt; on our Kiwi version so that you can hook up your own domain to customise a wide range of great web applications such as GMail, Blogger and Zoho. In the very near future we also plan to add some cool new Kiwi-made services that we really want to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it is appropriate that the launch of a new product should be celebrated with some special offers. So until the end of February we are offering new .COM, .NET, .ORG and .NAME domains for only $19.90 NZD plus .INFO for $9.90 NZD. We are also able to offer a FREE one year extension if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer your existing domains&lt;/a&gt; across to iWantMyName NZ. Transfers can be handled from your personal dashboard once you &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin&quot;&gt;join up&lt;/a&gt;. Please note that all domain prices quoted on the Kiwi site are GST exclusive and that we provide full GST invoicing to all our valued customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are supporting the Australasian Linux conference &lt;a href=&quot;http://lca2010.org.nz&quot;&gt;LCA2010&lt;/a&gt; which rolls into our hometown Wellington on 18-23 January. Look out for the iWantMyName crew at our stand at the Open Day on Saturday 23rd. We would be happy to demo the new site and discuss how we are supporting the open source movement and other technology communities in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Massive Price Reduction For Russian, Polish &amp; Czech Domain Names</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What better way to begin the new year 2010 than by receiving notice about price reductions from several registries? And since we always strive to pass on better prices to our customers, we are happy to announce the following new prices for the Russian, Polish and Czech domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cz-domain-name-registration-for-czech-republic&quot;&gt;.CZ Domain Names&lt;/a&gt;: $59.00 --&amp;gt; $39.00 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ru-russian-domain-name-registration-for-russian-federation&quot;&gt;.RU Domain Names&lt;/a&gt;: $49.00 --&amp;gt; $39.00 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pl-polish-domain-name-registration-for-poland&quot;&gt;.PL Domain Names&lt;/a&gt;: $79.00 --&amp;gt; $39.00 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eastern European country code top-level domains are growing fast and can be found amongst the top 25 &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html&quot;&gt;most popular domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; worldwide with .CZ (Czech Republic) having 591,000, .PL (Poland) 1.53 million and .RU (Russia) 2.31 million registered addresses in total. At iWantMyName we are fully enabled to search and register &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot;&gt;Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)&lt;/a&gt; which are now possible for both Cyrillic characters under .RU and the Polish alphabet letters within the .PL namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domains with Accents, Greek &amp; Cyrillic Characters Shortly Available for Europe</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) keep on increasing in popularity. After the big news of IDN country code top-level domains and the recent introduction of .NAME domain names with special characters, another domain extension is now opening its namespace to non-Latin alphabets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of December 10th it will be possible to officially register IDNs under &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot;&gt;.EU&lt;/a&gt;, the top-level domain for the European Union. With 27 member states and 23 official languages, this is an important step as many countries use these characters in their written language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters include the Swedish å, German Umlauts ä, ö, ü and the Romanian ș letter. But the process doesn&amp;#39;t end with the extended Latin alphabet with accents. Both the complete Cyrillic and Greek alphabet will soon be supported as well. See the full character list below: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latin supplement alphabet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;à, á, â, ã, ä, å, æ, ç, è, é, ê, ë, ì, í, î, ï, ð, ñ, ò, ó, ô, õ, ö, ø, ù, ú, û, ü, ý, þ, ÿw &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latin extended alphabet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ā, ă, ą, ć, ĉ, ċ, č, ď, đ, ē, ĕ, ė, ę, ě, ĝ, ğ, ġ, ģ, ĥ, ħ, ĩ, ī, ĭ, į, ı, ĵ, ķ, ĺ, ļ, ľ, ŀ, ł, ń, ņ, ň, ŉ, ŋ, ō, ŏ, ő, œ, ŕ, ŗ, ř, ś, ŝ, š, ť, ŧ, ũ, ū, ŭ, ů, ű, ų, ŵ, ŷ, ź, ż, ž, ș, ț &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greek alphabet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ΐ, ά, έ, ή, ί, ΰ, α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ, ν, ξ, ο, π, ρ, ς, σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω, ϊ, ϋ, ό, ύ, ώ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greek extended alphabet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ἀ, ἁ, ἂ, ἃ, ἄ, ἅ, ἆ, ἇ, ἐ, ἑ, ἒ, ἓ, ἔ, ἕ, ἠ, ἡ, ἢ, ἣ, ἤ, ἥ, ἦ, ἧ, ἰ, ἱ, ἲ, ἳ, ἴ, ἵ, ἶ, ἷ, ὀ, ὁ, ὂ, ὃ, ὄ, ὅ, ὐ, ὑ, ὒ, ὓ, ὔ, ὕ, ὖ, ὗ, ὠ, ὡ, ὢ, ὣ, ὤ, ὥ, ὦ, ὧ, ὰ, ά, ὲ, έ, ὴ, ή, ὶ, ί, ὸ, ό, ὺ, ύ, ὼ, ώ, ᾀ, ᾁ, ᾂ, ᾃ, ᾄ, ᾅ, ᾆ, ᾇ, ᾐ, ᾑ, ᾒ, ᾓ, ᾔ, ᾕ, ᾖ, ᾗ, ᾠ, ᾡ, ᾢ, ᾣ, ᾤ, ᾥ, ᾦ, ᾧ, ᾰ, ᾱ, ᾲ, ᾳ, ᾴ, ᾶ, ᾷ, ῂ, ῃ, ῄ, ῆ, ῇ, ῐ, ῑ, ῒ, ΐ, ῖ, ῗ, ῠ, ῡ, ῢ, ΰ, ῤ, ῥ, ῦ, ῧ, ῲ, ῳ, ῴ, ῶ, ῷ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyrillic alphabet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;а, б, в, г, д, е, ж, з, и, й, к, л, м, н, о, п, р, с, т, у, ф, х, ц, ч, ш, щ, ъ, ы, ь, э, ю, я &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName will be fully enabled for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot;&gt;.EU IDN domain registrations&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for the launch on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Google Sites Website Templates For Your Wedding, Family, Restaurant &amp; More</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/08/website-hosting-alternatives-to-your-geocities-page.html&quot;&gt;demise of Geocities&lt;/a&gt;, it was only a matter of time before Google ramped up its website creation offering for the mass consumer market. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sites.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Sites&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a while but this week they launched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2009/11/get-started-with-google-sites-templates.html&quot;&gt;new template gallery&lt;/a&gt; which further simplifies making your own personal or small business website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free website builder is aimed firmly at small companies, home users, schools and not-for-profits who just need to get online with a basic brochure quality set-up and who don&amp;#39;t have corporate level online marketing budgets to spend. The new templates  should drive a lot of interest in the service, which previously had only a low profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tkTGrOcFiz0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Google Sites webpage templates is great news for iWantMyName customers because we already offer to link your domains through to free Google services. There are many templates available already, some examples from the directory are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build your family website - Template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-11-20-family-website-template.png&quot; alt=&quot;family-website-template.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers managing their domains through iWantMyName get free provisioning so that they can hang all their Google docs, including GMail and Sites beneath their own personal domain name. So now you don&amp;#39;t need a team of web experts to set up all the services you need for a home office, small or medium sized enterprise or not-for-profit organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>6 Free DNS Hosting Services For Your Domain Names</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of our core philosophies at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot; title=&quot;Domain&quot;&gt;iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; is openness. For example, we we don&amp;#39;t force you to use our nameservers and DNS hosting services for your domain names. It might even make perfect sense to seperate &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot; title=&quot;Register Domain&quot;&gt;domain registration&lt;/a&gt; and DNS hosting in some cases. That&amp;#39;s why you can always update the nameservers of your registered domains in real-time through your online dashboard to host it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many free DNS hosting services out there and depending on the level of service or amount of domains (some of them offer paid account upgrades) they might already be sufficient for your needs. Some of the most popular ones are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoneedit.com&quot;&gt;ZoneEdit.com&lt;/a&gt; (5 domains free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everydns.com&quot;&gt;EveryDNS.net&lt;/a&gt; (from OpenDNS founder &lt;a href=&quot;http://david.ulevitch.com/&quot;&gt;David Ulevitch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://free.editdns.net&quot;&gt;editDNS.net&lt;/a&gt; (free for up to 5 domains)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xname.org&quot;&gt;XName.org&lt;/a&gt; (non-commercial)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://freedns.afraid.org&quot;&gt;FreeDNS&lt;/a&gt; (unlimited domains, 20 subdomains)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zerigo.com/managed-dns&quot;&gt;Zerigo&lt;/a&gt; (also integrates with &lt;a href=&quot;http://addons.heroku.com/zerigo_dns&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Host And Share Files On Your Custom Domain With Droplr</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://droplr.com&quot; title=&quot;Droplr&quot;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt; is a little Mac application that runs in your menubar and can be used for uploading, hosting and sharing files with your favourite Twitter client or other apps. What we really like with Droplr is the custom domain option. Simply enter your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot; title=&quot;Short Domain Search&quot;&gt;short domain name&lt;/a&gt; into their web application, change the DNS A record settings and all links to your hosted files will contain your branded URL immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s best to see it in action so watch the demo video below and see how easy Droplr works with Twitter or email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu_BP1RRN7w&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service is currently in private beta but we could score some invites for you which will be raffled among all commenters to this blog post (don&amp;#39;t forget to leave your email address).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Doppelgänger Double: Benikvrij &amp; meinName start in Europe</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It is with a huge amount of pride that we announce the launch of two new domain registrar sites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-11-06-benikvrij.png&quot; alt=&quot;benikvrij.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xxlwebhosting.nl&quot; title=&quot;XXL Webhosting&quot;&gt;great partner&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands we&amp;#39;ve created &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://benikvrij.nl&quot; title=&quot;Benikvrij&quot;&gt;Benikvrij&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;/strong&gt;Am I free), a Dutch language version of our service. With all the functionality of our existing site, local web apps, plus full Euro currency integration Benikvrij introduces the iWantMyName platform to one of the largest domain markets in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we aren&amp;#39;t just stopping there. We&amp;#39;ve also opened a wholly owned and operated German language domain registrar site and we called it simply &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinname.com&quot; title=&quot;Mein Name&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;meinName&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (my name).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-11-06-meinname.png&quot; alt=&quot;meinname.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German language site is a special achievement because &lt;a href=&quot;http://ideegeo.com&quot; title=&quot;ideegeo&quot;&gt;ideegeo&lt;/a&gt; in part has its origins in an idea that began in Germany. So meinName is a little bit like a return home for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new sites demonstrate how we can powerfully leverage the underlying platform technology behind iWantMyName and how we can make other partnerships work in new markets. Expect to see further rollouts and cool new services in the future as we change the face of domain name management.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2010 Launch of Internationalized Country Code Domain Extensions Announced</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;ICANN, the internet&amp;#39;s governing body, yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-30oct09-en.htm&quot;&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; the introduction of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) extensions for nations and territories. This means that a full web address including the domain suffix can contain non-Latin characters such as Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew or Greek in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The coming introduction of non-Latin characters represents the biggest technical change to the Internet since it was created four decades ago,&amp;quot; said ICANN chairman Peter Dengate Thrush. &amp;quot;Right now Internet address endings are limited to Latin characters - A to Z. But the Fast Track Process is the first step in bringing the 100,000 characters of the languages of the world online for domain names.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the video with people from around the world explaining how localized domain names will help them using the internet in their native language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Movie no longer available.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of internationalized country domains is an important step towards a global internet and we would like to congratulate ICANN and everybody involved in achieving this long-awaited milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) For .NAME Available Soon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At iWantMyName we strongly believe in an open and inclusive internet for all people on this planet. Hence we are always happy to support new technical developments that move us towards a truly internationlized web. We are making a special effort to roll out new services that enable multi-lingual functionality across the global web infrastructure, as these services become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may still take a while until we will see localized versions of the .COM, .NET or .ORG suffixes, ICANN is making steady progress in pursuing changes to introduce internationalized country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .РФ (.RF - Russian Federation) or .бг (.bg - Bulgaria) with a possible start date as early as 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.NAME introduces IDN registration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a further step to tear down language barriers on the web &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisign.com&quot; title=&quot;.COM / .NET / .NAME Registry VeriSign&quot;&gt;VeriSign&lt;/a&gt;, the domain registry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot; title=&quot;.NAME domain&quot;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt;, enables the registration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot; title=&quot;Register Internationalized Domain Names&quot;&gt;internationalized web addresses&lt;/a&gt; with non-latin characters beneath this domain extension. From Nov 7th, you will be able to search and register domains in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisign.com/domain-name-services/domain-information-center/idn-domains/scripts-languages/index.html&quot; title=&quot;.COM / .NET Internationalised Domain Names Information&quot;&gt;same language scripts&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Arabic, Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese or Japanese) as it is already possible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot; title=&quot;.COM Domain&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot; title=&quot;.NET Domain&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; web addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDN resources &amp;amp; domain tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot;&gt;Online IDN Keyboard for other languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/name-generator/turn-words-upside-down&quot;&gt;FlipMyName - create mirrored domain names&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>What Is The Ranking of My Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD)? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part V</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The last part of our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series shows the ranking of country code top-level domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;How many TLDs exist in total?&quot;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;Top 10 Domain Extensions&quot;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&quot;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.DE Takes Lead Again in ccTLD Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered where your country domain extension sits in the global marketplace? It&amp;#39;s a little bit like Formula One, with nations jockeying constantly for supremacy. Recently German suffix .DE pipped China&amp;#39;s .CN domain to a pole position with slightly more registrations. That&amp;#39;s good news for iWantMyName because we are about to launch a &lt;a href=&quot;http://meinname.com&quot;&gt;German language version&lt;/a&gt; of our highly successful domain management platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a handy reference list showing which ccTLDs are most popular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.DE (Germany)&lt;/a&gt; - 13.05 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cn-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&quot;&gt;.CN (China)&lt;/a&gt; - 12.54 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.UK (United Kingdom)&lt;/a&gt; - 7.83 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&quot;&gt;.NL (Netherlands)&lt;/a&gt; - 3.51 million&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>How Big Are The Generic Top-Level Domain Namespaces? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part IV</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Part 4 of our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series breaks down the size of generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;How many TLDs exist in total?&quot;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domains-are-registered-in-total.html&quot; title=&quot;Total Number Of Domain Registrations Worldwide?&quot;&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;Top 10 Domain Extensions&quot;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html&quot;&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful resource for these domain name statistics is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/idashboard/public/&quot; title=&quot;ICANN Public Dashboard&quot;&gt;ICANN Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; which provides an interactive timeline on the growth of generic TLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://idashboard.icann.org/idashboards/engine.swf?dashID=159&amp;amp;serverURL=http://idashboard.icann.org/idashboards&amp;amp;guest=icannguest&quot; title=&quot;.AERO - .MOBI domain name statistics&quot;&gt;.AERO - .MOBI interactive timeline&lt;/a&gt; or click for larger view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of registered gTLDs and their ranking is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .COM: 82.01 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .NET: 12.42 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .ORG: 7.79 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .INFO: 5.24 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .BIZ: 2.03 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .MOBI: ~ 850.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .NAME: ~ 300.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .TEL: ~ 220.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .ASIA: ~ 210.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .TRAVEL: ~130.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .CAT: ~38.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .PRO: ~37.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .JOBS: ~16.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .AERO: ~6.500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .COOP: ~5.800&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; .MUSEUM: ~550&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total number of generic domain extensions (September 2009): 111.3 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.PE Domain Name Registration for Peru Enabled</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;During the last two weeks we added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico&quot; title=&quot;.MX Domain Extension - Mexico&quot;&gt;.MX internet suffix of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&quot; title=&quot;.NL Domain Extension - Netherlands&quot;&gt;Dutch .NL web address&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the expansion of country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) at iWantMyName continues with the Peruvian &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pe-peruvian-domain-name-registration-for-peru&quot; title=&quot;.PE Internet Domain Extension&quot;&gt;.PE domain extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.pymex.pe/noticias/peru/1753-el-90-de-pymes-no-tienen-identidad-en-internet.html&quot;&gt;recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish only), the Peruvian telecommunications company, Red Cientifica Peruana (RCP), is aiming to help one million people to establish an online identity with .PE domain names in the next 3 years. The South-American Republic of Peru has a population of 28.8 million people with approx. 8-9 million internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As .PE domains can be registered by anybody worldwide, you can also use them in domain hacks such as overhy.pe, stereoty.pe or giusep.pe. And even better, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot; title=&quot;Search For Short Domain Names&quot;&gt;registration of short domain names&lt;/a&gt; for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/08/10-tools-to-run-an-url-shortener-on-your-own-custom-domain.html&quot; title=&quot;Personal URL shortener&quot;&gt;personal URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; is possible as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have included some available domain hack ideas using the .PE domain name extension below:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Are The Top 10 Global Domain Extensions? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part III</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post showing the top 10 list of domain extensions is part 3 of our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;How many TLDs exist in total?&quot;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domains-are-registered-in-total.html&quot; title=&quot;Total Number Of Domain Registrations Worldwide?&quot;&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&quot;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html&quot;&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Top 10 global domain name extension list&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ten largest domain extensions unite a whopping 150 million registrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;: 82.01 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt; (Germany): 13.05 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cn-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&quot;&gt;.CN&lt;/a&gt; (China): 12.55 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;: 12.42 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom): 7.83 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt;: 7.79 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt;: 5.24 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&quot;&gt;.NL&lt;/a&gt; (Netherlands): 3.5 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot;&gt;.EU&lt;/a&gt; (European Union): 2.98 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ru-russian-domain-name-registration-for-russian-federation&quot;&gt;.RU&lt;/a&gt; (Russia): 2.31 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.COM is by far the the largest namespace worldwide, followed by the German .DE internet code, the Chinese .CN country domain extension and the generic .NET web address. It is very likely that .CN will surpass .DE again shortly (they recently changed positions). However, it will be interesting to see which impact the introduction of a suffix with Chinese characters such as .中国 (.CHINA) might have on the future growth of the .CN address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers also show how strong country domain extensions are in Europe with .UK, .NL and .EU taking further positions after .ORG and .INFO in the international Top 10 ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.NL Domain Name Search &amp; Registration Now Available</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After the recent addition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico&quot; title=&quot;.MX Domain Extension - Mexico&quot;&gt;.MX (Mexico) domains&lt;/a&gt;, we are introducing another country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for you at iWantMyName.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&quot; title=&quot;.NL Domain Extension - Netherlands&quot;&gt;.NL domain extension&lt;/a&gt; can now be registered at only $19.00 USD / year. With 3.5 million total registrations, the web address of the Netherlands is one of the top 10 domain extensions worldwide and the second biggest country code domain in Europe after &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot; title=&quot;.DE German Domain Extension&quot;&gt;Germany&amp;#39;s .DE suffix&lt;/a&gt;. More information can be found at the official &lt;a href=&quot;http://sidn.nl/&quot; title=&quot;.NL Domain Registry&quot;&gt;.NL registry&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the .NL domain search and registration is also available through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&quot;&gt;iPhone DomainApp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>100 Tiny Domain Names For Your Custom URL Shortener</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With recent news of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2009/10/04/cli-gs-shut-down/&quot;&gt;cli.gs&amp;#39; shutdown&lt;/a&gt;, the debate about URL shorteners and issues with possible broken links is coming up again. The only way to prevent this is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/08/10-tools-to-run-an-url-shortener-on-your-own-custom-domain.html&quot;&gt;run a custom URL shortener on your own domain&lt;/a&gt; but finding available short domain names with two letters is getting more challenging by the day.
There are only a few country code domain extensions (ccTLDs) that allow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&quot;&gt;registration of tiny 2-character domains&lt;/a&gt; at regular prices, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New: .MX Domains - The Mexican Country Code Extension</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As of today you can register &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico&quot;&gt;.MX domains&lt;/a&gt; (Mexico) at iWantMyName. The domain registration requirements are similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot;&gt;.COM domains&lt;/a&gt; so there are no restrictions or local requirements. Our introduction price is $99.00 USD for all new registrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican country code domain extension was only opened for registration earlier this year. Before that Mexico&amp;#39;s web address could only be registered under the second-level &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico&quot;&gt;.COM.MX domain&lt;/a&gt; (.NET.MX, .ORG.MX and others are restricted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about .MX and Mexico:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Population: 111 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Language: Spanish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Total domains: approx. 300k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Official registry: nic.mx
Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://domainesinfo.fr/statistiques.php&quot;&gt;DomainesInfo&lt;/a&gt;
Start the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; for your .MX domain now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two in our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series which answers the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;How many TLDs exist in total?&quot;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&quot;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&quot;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html&quot;&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Part 2: How many domains are registered worldwide?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the latest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisign.com/Resources/Naming_Services_Resources/Domain_Name_Industry_Brief/&quot; title=&quot;VeriSign Domain Industry Brief&quot;&gt;VeriSign&amp;#39;s Domain Industry Brief&lt;/a&gt; there were &lt;strong&gt;184 million domain name registrations across all top-level domains&lt;/strong&gt; by the end of the second quarter 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graph shows the growth over time and the distribution between different domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-09-30-graph-how-many-domains-worldwide.png&quot; alt=&quot;Total Domain Name Registrations Graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these 184 million total registrations, &lt;strong&gt;gTLDs account for 109.6 million registered domains and ccTLDs have a registration base of 74.4 million addresses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other quick facts about the domain name industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  20.9 million new domain names registered in the first six months of 2009.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  .COM &amp;amp; .NET account for 50% of all domains registered worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The top 10 country code domain extensions comprise 66 per cent of all ccTLD registrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The top 3 ccTLDs .DE, .CN &amp;amp; .UK represent 45 percent of all registered ccTLD names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  .AR (Argentina), .RU (Russia) and .BR (Brazil) are currently the fastest growing ccTLDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed Information about industry growth rates and ccTLD statistics can be found in the September 2009 issue of the Domain Industry Brief: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verisign.com/domain-name-services/domain-information-center/domain-name-resources/domain-name-report-sept09.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Domain Industry Brief September 2009 PDF&quot;&gt;PDF Download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How Many Domain Name Extensions Exist Worldwide? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part I</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there are 280 internet domain extensions in total? And that .COM &amp;amp; .NET account for 50% of all domains registered worldwide? Or maybe you have always wondered what the most popular country code domains are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series we will answer these questions and provide you with some interesting numbers around the global domain name space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domains-are-registered-in-total.html&quot;&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&quot;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&quot;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we go with the first anwer. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-09-25-blogtld-census-480px.png&quot; alt=&quot;tld census&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2009/03/tld-census/&quot;&gt;ICANN Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have &lt;strong&gt;280 domain extensions in total&lt;/strong&gt;. The two main groups are the so-called gTLDs (generic top-level domains) and the ccTLDs (country code top-level domains). We will go into more detail about gTLD and ccTLD registration numbers later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic top-level domains:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20 generic TLD suffixes are used mostly internationally and represent the vast majority of all registered domains worldwide. They are divided into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  4 unrestricted TLDs:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&quot; title=&quot;.COM Domain&quot;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&quot; title=&quot;.NET Domain&quot;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&quot; title=&quot;.ORG Domain&quot;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot; title=&quot;.INFO domain&quot;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt; (can be purchased by anyone without any restrictions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  3 Generic-restricted TLDs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&quot; title=&quot;.BIZ Domain&quot;&gt;.BIZ&lt;/a&gt; (for Businesses), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&quot; title=&quot;.NAME domain&quot;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt; (for Individuals) &amp;amp; .PRO (for credentialed professionals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  13 Sponsored TLDs: .AERO, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia&quot; title=&quot;.ASIA Domain&quot;&gt;.ASIA&lt;/a&gt;, .CAT, .COOP, .EDU (US only), .GOV (US only), .INT, .JOBS, .MIL (US only), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mobi-domain-name-registration-for-mobile&quot; title=&quot;.MOBI domain&quot;&gt;.MOBI&lt;/a&gt;, .MUSEUM, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&quot; title=&quot;.TEL Domain&quot;&gt;.TEL&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; .TRAVEL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country code top-level domains:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries of this world are represented on the internet by 248 ccTLDs altogether:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  242 are based on the official English short names after the ISO 3166-1 standard. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/&quot; title=&quot;IANA root zone database&quot;&gt;list of all country code extensions&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the IANA root zone database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Exceptionally reserved codes are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island&quot; title=&quot;.AC Domain&quot;&gt;.AC&lt;/a&gt; (Ascension Island), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&quot; title=&quot;.EU Domain&quot;&gt;.EU&lt;/a&gt; (European Union) &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&quot; title=&quot;.UK Domain&quot;&gt;.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom, offical ISO short name is GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Former country codes: .SU (Soviet Union), .TP (Portuguese Timor, now &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste&quot; title=&quot;.TL Domain Registration&quot;&gt;.TL&lt;/a&gt; for Timor-Leste) &amp;amp; .YU (Yugoslavia, split into &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&quot; title=&quot;.ME Domain&quot;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; for Montenegro and .RS for Serbia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New top-level domain extensions (outlook):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html&quot; title=&quot;New domain extensions&quot;&gt;new top-level domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; will change the domain landscape. If ICANN sticks to its current plan to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtld-program.htm&quot; title=&quot;New gTLD program&quot;&gt;expand the internet address space&lt;/a&gt; with new addresses such as .BERLIN, .NYC or .RADIO next year, we should see a completely different picture in about 3 years. The 20 &amp;quot;g&amp;quot;s could be more like 200-500 then and will surpass the country codes by far on the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your prediction for the number of TLDs by the end of 2012? We&amp;#39;d love to see them in the comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>20 Website Hosting Alternatives To Your Geocities Page</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yahoo&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://geocities.yahoo.com/&quot; title=&quot;Geocities&quot;&gt;Geocities&lt;/a&gt; service is about to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/&quot; title=&quot;Geocities closes&quot;&gt;close&lt;/a&gt; in 2 months and it&amp;#39;s getting time to look for an alternative, if you haven&amp;#39;t already done it. &lt;strong&gt;Today we&amp;#39;d like to recommend both some free and paid services for hosting your own website.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s start with one basic thing first and that&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot; title=&quot;Your own domain name&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;your own domain name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A domain should be the foundation for every website because, compared to an internet address like &lt;em&gt;geocities.com/yourwebsite,&lt;/em&gt; you have full ownership and control over it. This gives you the advantage of being able to switch to another website hosting service if you become dissatisfied with features, price or customer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By seperating the three elements website hosting, email and domain registration you can even further minimise the risk of being caught in another Geocities-like incident. In such a case you simply have to point your domain name to a new hosting service whilst still retaining the same overall branding and email address. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&quot; title=&quot;Domains For Apps&quot;&gt;Domains For Apps&lt;/a&gt; offering can help you to achieve this 3-way setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following 20 services make building a website, blog or community easy. It&amp;#39;s worth to take your time and compare their features and prices to find the tool that&amp;#39;s best suited for you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>10 Tools to run an URL Shortener on your own Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The sudden shutdown of popular URL shortener &lt;a href=&quot;http://tr.im&quot; title=&quot;tr.im URL shortener&quot;&gt;tr.im&lt;/a&gt; was already covered by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2009/08/09/trim-shuts-down/&quot; title=&quot;tr.im on Mashable&quot;&gt;main&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/09/trim-throws-in-the-towel/&quot; title=&quot;tr.im on Techcrunch&quot;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_hammers_nail_in_coffin_for_trim.php&quot; title=&quot;tr.im on ReadWriteWeb&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; so we won&amp;#39;t go into further details on the business side. In short the main problem resulting from this are the broken links someday and there&amp;#39;s only one solution how you can prevent this in the future: &lt;strong&gt;run your own URL shortener&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it all comes down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/i-want-my-name-or-how-you-can-own-your-online-identity-with-domains.html&quot; title=&quot;Own your identity&quot;&gt;owning your namespace as discussed earlier with Facebook&amp;#39;s username landrush&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;You are only able to fully control what&amp;#39;s happening with your links if you own the domain name&lt;/strong&gt; and run your own URL shortener on it. Anybody who&amp;#39;s considering Twitter as an important part of their business or personal brand should start thinking about customising their short URLs now (also see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot; title=&quot;How to find a domain hack&quot;&gt;domain hack examples&lt;/a&gt; how they are used to create short links).&lt;/p&gt;

As their own service uses the ➡.ws domain you should also be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot; title=&quot;Virtual Keyboard IDN search and registration&quot;&gt;IDNs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

You need to install a small script or use Wordpress though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: 03/02/2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular URL shortening service bit.ly is now offering a Pro version with custom domain functionality. Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&quot;&gt;bit.ly Pro for your own domain name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/buy-short-domain-name-bitly-pro-custom-url-shortener.html&quot;&gt;how to find a memorable short domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you might argue that there&amp;#39;s still a risk should one of these services stop to exist but at least you own the domain and can redirect links to another website or landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Run a URL shortener on your own machine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

Offers basic analytics and requires Wordpress 2.5 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

You need some technical knowledge for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Search IDNs with the Virtual Keyboard</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We have received a lot of positive feedback in the local community about our recent announcement for &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/07/idn-internationalised-domain-names-with-special-characters.html&quot; title=&quot;Internationalised Domain Names&quot;&gt;Internationalised Domain Names&lt;/a&gt; with Māori macrons. A question we were asked quite often was how you can actually enter special characters on an English keyboard layout. While most operating systems have character tables to help you entering letters of foreign alphabets, we now have an easier alternative for you online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&quot; title=&quot;Virtual Keyboard IDN search and registration&quot;&gt;Virtual Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; allows you to choose from different non-English keyboard layouts.&lt;/strong&gt; You just need to change the respective language and can start typing in Chinese, Japanese, Greek or Hebrew. Unfortunately it doesn&amp;#39;t support one of our favourite languages but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language&quot; title=&quot;Klingon IDNs?&quot;&gt;Klingon&lt;/a&gt; still hasn&amp;#39;t made it into the official UTF-8 standard... ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;IDN Punycode Converter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another little domain tool for IDNs is our IDN Punycode converter. All Internationalised Domain Names are converted into ASCII characters using Punycode to make them readable in the Domain Name System (DNS). So instead of the domain müller.com, computers actually read xn--mller-kva.com. The tool might be helpful to find out the ASCII syntax of an IDN. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/idns/idn-punycode-converter&quot; title=&quot;IDN conversion tool punycode&quot;&gt;Check out the IDN Punycode converter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Support For Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koreromaori.co.nz/news/mlw&quot; title=&quot;Māori Language Week&quot;&gt;Māori Language Week&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand and on this occasion we&amp;#39;re very proud to announce support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name&quot; title=&quot;Internationalised Domain Names&quot;&gt;Internationalised Domain Names&lt;/a&gt; (IDNs) at iWantMyName. Indigenous groups around the world are looking seriously at how best to protect their digital identity, as the Internet continues to impact powerfully in both in economic and sociological terms. Providing Internationalised Domain Names not only for the use of Māori language domains but non-Latin characters in general is a small but significant step towards preserving the expression of language and culture online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationalised Domain Names can be accessed in any modern web browser such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer (&amp;gt; Version 7.0 which is another reaseon why &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2009/07/16/ie6-must-die/&quot; title=&quot;IE6 must die&quot;&gt;IE 6 must die&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>50+ New Domain Extensions We Might See In 2010</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The iWantMyName team is about to head to Australia to attend the 35th &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ntlds&quot;&gt;ICANN meeting in Sydney&lt;/a&gt; next week. &lt;a href=&quot;http://icann.org/&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; is the governing body of the internet and the acronym for &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nternet &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;orporation For &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ssigned &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;ames And &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;umbers&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s crucial for us to follow what&amp;#39;s happening in the domain business and ICANN meetings are always a perfect place to mingle with industry experts, other domain registrars and registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most discussed topic at ICANN Sydney will be the so-called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://icann.org/en/topics/new-gtld-program.htm&quot;&gt;new gTLD program&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; which plans to &lt;strong&gt;extend the current system of 20 generic top-level domains&lt;/strong&gt; such as .COM, .NET or .ORG with new domain name extensions. However, it will not be possible for everybody to have its own domain extension in a way you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;register a domain name&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. There are still financial and technical requirements to be fullfilled. If you&amp;#39;re interested to read more about the process we recommend Michele Neylon&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/posts/new_tlds_for_dummies_sort_of&quot;&gt;New TLDs for Dummies (sort of)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and ICANN&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.icann.org/2009/05/so-where-are-we-up-to-with-these-new-internet-extensions/&quot;&gt;So where are we up to with these new internet extensions?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of new gTLD initiatives popping up lately and there will be many more in the coming months with some of them being revealed in Sydney next week. This is a &lt;strong&gt;list of new domain name extensions&lt;/strong&gt; that we have found so far (in alphabetical order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is already an impressive list, there are still many initiatives which haven&amp;#39;t been announced yet. We will definitely see more City top-level domains (maybe a .SYDNEY next week?), IDN (Internationalised Domain Names) TLDs in non-latin alphabets and also brand extensions such as .NIKE, .APPLE etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, it&amp;#39;s time to get ready and pack our suitcases. We will keep you updated about new top-level domains on a regular basis. See you in Sydney!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>I want my name! Or how you can own your online identity.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of buzz around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130&quot;&gt;Facebook Vanity URL launch&lt;/a&gt; this weekend where you will be able to register your username such as facebook.com/username instead of having a long profile address. Of course it will be nice to have your name on Facebook, we will try and get &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/about&quot;&gt;our names&lt;/a&gt; too. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/not_everyone_is_excited_abot_facebook_vanity_urls.php&quot;&gt;not everybody is excited&lt;/a&gt; and the whole story shows the dilemma that people are facing when it comes to owning who you are online. Do you really want Facebook (or MySpace, Twitter, etc.) to be your primary address identifier for other people? All these services are currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/06/09/facebook-usernames-and-the-battle-over-your-digital-identity/&quot;&gt;battling&lt;/a&gt; over your identity but what if you don&amp;#39;t like Facebook anymore &lt;a href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/2009/06/the-future-of-facebook-usernames.html&quot;&gt;in 2 years&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.twitpocalypse.com/&quot;&gt;Twitpocalypse&lt;/a&gt; is upon us or MySpace mysteriously vanishes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer to these questions is simple: Own your personal domain name!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domains are around &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics&quot;&gt;since 25 years&lt;/a&gt; (!) now and there&amp;#39;s no sign that they will go away anytime soon. &lt;strong&gt;A domain name is the only address that you can really own and control&lt;/strong&gt;. You &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it, you pay for it and you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&quot;&gt;use it the way you want&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

				<title>Real-time DNS Management For Your Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Having total &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt; control has been one of the most requested features of our power users. DNS is not only the underlying technology for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&quot;&gt;Domains for Apps&lt;/a&gt; but also probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://blog.mosso.com/2009/06/dns-the-overlooked-cloud-service/&quot;&gt;the most overlooked cloud service&lt;/a&gt;. Hence we are pleased now to offer a low-level DNS editor which gives you full control over your domains and lets you manage DNS records completely in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new DNS editor supports A, CNAME, MX, AAAA, TXT &amp;amp; SRV records. Have a look at this shiny new tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-06-10-real-time-dns-management-editor.png&quot; alt=&quot;real-time-dns-management-editor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we appreciate your feedback in the comments, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Free Email With Zoho Business On Your Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We have added another email hosting &amp;amp; online collaboration service to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&quot;&gt;Domains for Apps&lt;/a&gt; offering. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite&quot;&gt;Zoho Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offers a free email solution / business portal for up to 10 users - all under your own domain name. By registering your domain with iWantMyName you can now benefit from our easy domain configuration feature for Zoho Business and start using email with just a few clicks. Here&amp;#39;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&quot;&gt;transfer&lt;/a&gt; the domain name you want to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://business.zoho.com/&quot;&gt;Sign up for a free Zoho Business account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add your domain name&lt;/strong&gt; to Zoho Business:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-05-28-zoho_add_domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;zoho_add_domain.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the &lt;strong&gt;CNAME validation&lt;/strong&gt; method:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-05-28-zoho_validate_domain.png&quot; alt=&quot;zoho_validate_domain.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the validation code in your iWantMyName dashboard under &amp;quot;Services --&amp;gt; Zoho Business&amp;quot; and &lt;strong&gt;we will configure your domain&lt;/strong&gt; with the respective DNS settings (CNAME and MX records) automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free version of Zoho Business is a great alternative to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&quot;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; and offers 1GB storage per user. You can upgrade at any time to the paid version with &lt;strong&gt;25GB storage and professional support&lt;/strong&gt; for $5 USD / month or $50 USD / year.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New Domain Search Feature: Check Domains via Twitter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to being &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&quot;&gt;Apple geeks&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re also big suckers for &lt;strong&gt;simplicity and productivity&lt;/strong&gt; at iWantMyName. So we thought: why not offer a domain search feature for a service where we spend lots of time anyway? Hence the concept of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iWantMyName Twitter Search Bot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today you&amp;#39;re able to &lt;strong&gt;check domain name availability&lt;/strong&gt; by sending a direct message to the &lt;em&gt;@iwantmyname&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account. Just start following us, send &amp;quot;d iwantmyname thedomainyouwant.com&amp;quot; and we&amp;#39;ll reply with the search result including a link to immediately register the domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-05-19-twitter-domain-search.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-domain-search.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search for alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; if a domain is taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-05-19-twitter-domain-search-taken.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-domain-search-taken.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately &lt;strong&gt;register the domain&lt;/strong&gt; if it&amp;#39;s available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-05-19-twitter-domain-search-free.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter-domain-search-free.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;whenever you think &amp;quot;I want my name&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; just open the Twitter client of your choice and off you go!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Art of Finding a Domain Hack</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;While many domain names under .COM and country code top-level domains are already taken, domain hacks are a good alternative to express yourself** **on the web. Wait, domain hack? Does that mean something bad? No, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack&quot;&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; a domain hack is &amp;quot;an unconventional domain name that combines domain levels, especially the top-level domain (TLD), to spell out the full &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; or title of the domain, making a kind of pun.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s have a look at some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;iWantMy.Name&lt;/em&gt; - our own domain hack (we could also have used iwantmyna.me or iwant.my/name)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domai.nr/&quot;&gt;Domai.nr&lt;/a&gt; - a great domain search engine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/&quot;&gt;Ma.tt&lt;/a&gt; - Blog of Matt Mullenweg, founder of Wordpress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cli.gs/&quot;&gt;Cli.gs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://awe.sm/&quot;&gt;awe.sm&lt;/a&gt; - URL shortening services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swinef.lu/&quot;&gt;Swinef.lu&lt;/a&gt; - our recent favourite ;)
More examples and inspiration can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.uncyclomedia.org/wiki/UnSource:List_of_domain_hacks&quot;&gt;Intercyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I find a domain hack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;http://xona.com/domainhacks/&quot;&gt;domain hack generator&lt;/a&gt; was developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://xona.com/&quot;&gt;Xona&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. While their classic tool is still around and also helps you to find email hacks (&amp;quot;a&amp;quot; replaced by &amp;quot;@&amp;quot;, e.g. iw@ntmyname.com using the domain ntmyname.com), there is a newer service that we at iWantMyName really like (they&amp;#39;re cool guys too). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are talking about the already mentioned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://domai.nr/&quot;&gt;Domai.nr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is absolutely fun to use. Brainstorming names with their search engine is easy and once you found something available you can directly &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;register your domain with iWantMyName&lt;/a&gt; by chosing us in their list of registrars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-05-15-screenshot-domainr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot-domainr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to manually search for words using a website like &lt;a href=&quot;http://morewords.com/&quot;&gt;More Words&lt;/a&gt;. They also have lists of words that end with a certain letter combination. Here&amp;#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/es/&quot;&gt;list of words ending with &amp;quot;es&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; for example (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&quot;&gt;Spanish domain extension&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I register a domain hack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main reasons to get a domain hack. First of all it&amp;#39;s fun. Secondly it&amp;#39;s easier to use them for sharing links on Twitter because they&amp;#39;re mostly shorter and memorable. Going one step further you can even combine domain hacks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/04/brandable-domain-list-for-short-url.html&quot;&gt;short domains&lt;/a&gt;. TechCrunch for example uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://awe.sm/&quot;&gt;awe.sm&lt;/a&gt; for branded URL shortening under &lt;em&gt;tcrn.ch&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geek.com/articles/news/amazon-introduces-amzncom-short-url-service-20090511/&quot;&gt;recently introduced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;em&gt;amzn.com&lt;/em&gt; short links for product pages such as &lt;em&gt;amzn.com/books&lt;/em&gt;. This is also how we are using our &lt;em&gt;iwantmy.name _domain hack: _iwantmy.name/d&lt;/em&gt; is forwarded to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;domains&lt;/a&gt; page, &lt;em&gt;iwantmy.name/a&lt;/em&gt; to our &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&quot;&gt;Domains for Apps&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; offering or &lt;em&gt;iwantmy.name/de&lt;/em&gt; to get more information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&quot;&gt;German internet address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which domain extensions are suitable for domain hacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d say pretty much all except the ones you can&amp;#39;t register because the country&amp;#39;s internet address is not operational (imagine all the possibilities you would have with the Eritrean domain extension .ER) or there are other restrictions in place. Alledia&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://www.alledia.com/blog/domain-names/a-beginners-guide-to-domain-hacks/&quot;&gt;Beginners Guide To Domain Hacks&lt;/a&gt; offers a good overview of the meaning for most country extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iWantMyName is currently running a promotion for some of the more popular domain hack extensions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/special-price-offer-brandable-domain-extensions.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;brandtastic&amp;quot; country codes&lt;/a&gt; .IN (India), .AT (Austria), .BE (Belgium) &amp;amp; .IM (Isle Of Man) are available for $US 14.90 only! See our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&quot;&gt;domain list&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless and creativity is your only limit. One last tip... Make sure you have fun with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;search for your domain hack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Brandtastic Domain Extensions for the Price of a .COM</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As of today through May 31st 2009, all new registrations (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&quot;&gt;iPhone domain orders&lt;/a&gt;) for the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&quot;&gt;international domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; will be priced at &lt;strong&gt;$US 14.90&lt;/strong&gt; for the first year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.AT&lt;/strong&gt; - the Austrian internet extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.BE&lt;/strong&gt; - country code top-level domain of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/im-domain-name-registration-for-isle-of-man&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.IM&lt;/strong&gt; - Isle of Man or Instant Messenger domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/in-indian-domain-name-registration-for-india&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.IN&lt;/strong&gt; - India&amp;#39;s web address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t miss out on the opportunity with these brandable domain extensions. Since their namespace is still fairly small compared to .COM, &lt;strong&gt;many great domains are
still available&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;special price promotion for .INFO domains&lt;/a&gt;. New registrations are only $US 9.90 until June 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;register your name now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Manage your .TEL domain with the My.tel iPhone app</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The official &lt;strong&gt;.TEL iPhone application&lt;/strong&gt; is available in the AppStore now. It offers an easy interface for all .TEL owners to update their domains directly from their iPhone or iPod touch. You could update the status before boarding a plane, on a road trip (don&amp;#39;t forget our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&quot;&gt;DomainApp to register domains&lt;/a&gt;) or just with your current location to tell your friends where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main features of My.tel are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Add, remove, hide or show your contact information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Update your status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Publish your location with an embedded map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Add or remove folders and profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Manage privacy settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Add or remove keywords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2009-04-20-dottel-domain-iphone-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;dottel-domain-iphone-app.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app works pretty well and especially the map feature helps to share your current location with your friends. Imagine being at this cool party (we all know how difficult to find they can be sometimes) and you could tell your mates: &amp;quot;Just go to my .TEL domain if you want to come by&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=308822420&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;download the My.tel app&lt;/a&gt; you currently also have the chance to &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/04/download-domainapp-win-itunes-gift-card-macbook-pro-ipod.html&quot;&gt;win a $10,000 iTunes gift card or a MacBook Pro from Apple&lt;/a&gt;. You don&amp;#39;t have a .TEL domain yet? &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;Check if your name is still available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>List of short &amp; brandable domain names</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/04/list-of-available-ultra-short-2-letter-domain-names.html&quot;&gt;list of 100 available ultra short domains&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;ve compiled a &lt;strong&gt;new free list *&lt;em&gt;for you with 2-letter domain names in the extensions &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mu-mauritian-domain-name-registration-for-mauritius&quot;&gt;.MU&lt;/a&gt; (Mauritius), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste&quot;&gt;.TL&lt;/a&gt; (East Timor), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ht-haitian-domain-name-registration-for-haiti&quot;&gt;.HT&lt;/a&gt; (Haiti), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cx-domain-name-registration-for-christmas-island&quot;&gt;.CX&lt;/a&gt; (Christmas Island), &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gs-domain-name-registration-for-south-georgia-and-the-south-sandwich-islands&quot;&gt;.GS&lt;/a&gt; (South Georgia &amp;amp; The Sandwich Islands) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&quot;&gt;.MS&lt;/a&gt; (Montserrat). This time they&amp;#39;re not only suited for URL shortening, abbreviations or your initials but even better *&lt;/em&gt;most of them are pronouncable and hence fully brandable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the full list of our short &amp;amp; brandable domain names:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Video: How to register domains fast and easy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Offering an &lt;strong&gt;easy domain registration service&lt;/strong&gt; was one of the main reasons why we&amp;#39;ve built iWantMyName. How many times have you been to your current domain provider and just wanted to buy a domain name but were presented with tons of different options, special offers or hosting plans that you really do not need at all? Maybe you even gave up completely because you didn&amp;#39;t know what to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are focussed on an easy domain registration process &lt;strong&gt;without all these hassles&lt;/strong&gt;. This process starts on our home page where you will find only a search box and a few links (which completely disappear when you&amp;#39;re logged in). The streamlined process continues with a search result page that brings you directly to the shopping cart without offering you unwanted additional products and ends with a simple confirmation page to finish your order. It&amp;#39;s 3 steps in total and only takes 30 seconds as you can see in the following video:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>List of 100 available ultra short domain names</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered about how to get an ultra short URL? We dugg around for you and compiled a list of some of the shortest domains that are still available for registration. Short URLs are primarily used from URL shortening services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://tr.im/&quot;&gt;tr.im&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://is.gd/&quot;&gt;is.gd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/&quot;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iwmn&quot;&gt;follow us&lt;/a&gt;) and other microblogging sites, but not limited to it. You could also just forward a short domain to your existing blog or website and use it as a shortcut. It&amp;#39;s not only easy to remember but also more visible in case long URLs are truncated. And last but not least it saves characters when you&amp;#39;re tweeting with your custom short URL. In this case we&amp;#39;d say: the shorter the better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=ae.gd&quot;&gt;ae.gd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=af.vg&quot;&gt;af.vg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=af.gd&quot;&gt;af.gd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=aj.vg&quot;&gt;aj.vg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=aj.tc&quot;&gt;aj.tc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=an.vg&quot;&gt;an.vg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>.TEL her you care - register your .TEL domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;.TEL is now available to the public and is already gaining momentum. Yesterday a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10203003-36.html?tag=newsEditorsPicksArea.0&quot;&gt;CNET article&lt;/a&gt; brought a record number of visitors to our site after mentioning the possibility of registering a .TEL domain via the iPhone using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&quot;&gt;our DomainApp&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve uploaded a new .TEL video to our Youtube channel. Hope you like it ;)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New extension: why you should buy a .TEL domain name</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.TEL domain extension is available for general registration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from March 24th, 2009 and a lot of you may wonder what this new address stands for. While .COM, .NET, .ORG and the country extensions are meant for general websites, the .TEL domain is completely different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The .TEL allows you to store, publish and update online all your contact information and keywords under your unique domain name, without the need for a website.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;you cannot use a .TEL domain for a regular website&lt;/strong&gt; but only for managing contact data and related keywords. After you registered a .TEL domain you&amp;#39;ll get access to the so-called .TEL hosting service at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tel.iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;tel.iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There you can enter all your contact details like address, phone number, web site, Skype username, Twitter profile etc. Could you do this in an old-school phone book? Of course not. A .TEL is basically an entry in an internet phonebook or better address book that can be updated in real-time. So wherever you are, be it on a business trip or on vacation: You can change the details at any time and people have instant access to your address details at your current location. You don&amp;#39;t want everybody on the internet having access to this data? No worries. Visitors of your .TEL domain can contact you and ask for permission to see your details. You are only exposing to the world what you really want to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No website required?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s correct. Whether you are an individual, small business owner, consultant or startup. You don&amp;#39;t need a website developed for your .TEL domain. It is already included in your domain name registration! A perfect way to get a quick website or business profile with all contact information up and running. Furthermore it offers a single entry point for all ways to contact you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Can I be found in search engines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Yes, you can. You have the possibility to add keywords to your domain name in order to be found in search engines like Google. Have you ever wondered why your company name does not show up in Google? A .TEL might be the solution. Get YourCompanyName.TEL and add industry-specific keywords to it and visitors can contact you immediately when found through a search engine. No need to spend money for search engine optimisation (SEO) for a .TEL domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot more that .TEL domains offer from a technical perspective. As all information is stored in the Domain Name System (DNS) it is extremely easy for external services to access this data. We expect to see many applications from Telcos or on mobile phones that start using this new extension to complement their address book software in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.TEL is managed by registry Telnic, based in London, UK. Further information can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://telnic.org/&quot;&gt;Telnic website&lt;/a&gt;, in their &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://telnic.org/brochures/top10/Top10ReasonsToBuy.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top 10 reasons to buy your .TEL domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and CNET Asia&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archived.link/http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/geekonomics/post.htm?id=63009224&quot;&gt;10 things you didn&amp;#39;t know about .TEL domains&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also published two videos on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/ideegeo&quot;&gt;ideegeo Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; that explain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KenBuzxcPYM&quot;&gt;.TEL for businesses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcvJekxLI58&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; in more detail. To register a domain please proceed to our homepage and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;enter your desired .TEL name in the search box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

				<title>Last minute Christmas gift idea: register a personal domain for your friends or family</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We all know the rush for the last few presents a couple of days before Christmas. But why should you go to overcrowded shopping centers when you can shop online? With iWantMyName you don&amp;#39;t even have to be afraid that it&amp;#39;s not delivered on time. It&amp;#39;s the 24th already? No worries, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/&quot;&gt;search for a domain name&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;#39;ll have it within a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a personal domain name for your friends or relatives is the perfect Christmas gift. Here are some ideas to find a good name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Get a .COM or .ME with first name (middle name) last name, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaNicholasClaus.com&quot;&gt;SantaNicholasClaus.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaNClaus.com&quot;&gt;SantaNClaus.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=HolySantaClaus.me&quot;&gt;HolySantaClaus.me&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=HolySClaus.me&quot;&gt;HolySClaus.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Be creative with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack&quot;&gt;domain hack&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=NicholasCla.us&quot;&gt;NicholasCla.us&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaLives.in&quot;&gt;SantaLives.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Register the Christmas domain .CX: &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaAndTheReindeer.cx&quot;&gt;SantaAndTheReindeer.cx&lt;/a&gt;
Add one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&quot;&gt;free features&lt;/a&gt; to it and the presentee can use his name immediately. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iWantMyName Team wishes Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
