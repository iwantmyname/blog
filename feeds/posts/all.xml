				<title>Death and digital properties</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple hundred years ago, it was possible to live and die leaving pretty much zero physical evidence of your existence. Except perhaps some kids. Today, though, someone with no identity footprint would be nearly unheard of. I&amp;rsquo;m even skeptical of companies that don&amp;rsquo;t have websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that so many of us have these broad digital presences — websites, email accounts, social media profiles, photos, videos, text — the footprints we leave behind may require some maintenance and planning. After all, your online self is as much a part of your life as your photo albums,  household items, and collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond keeping payment details updated, domains renewed, passwords secure, etc., we need to consider life&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;what ifs?&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;hit by a bus&amp;rdquo; scenarios, as we&amp;rsquo;ve called them at a few places I&amp;rsquo;ve worked. What happens if you&amp;rsquo;re not there tomorrow? Maybe you moved on to a new job, left a relationship, or actually were hit by a bus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone else access your accounts? Do you want them to? Did you want any of your online profiles or properties to be left accessible? Are there going to be business issues with websites or email accounts if domains were registered in your name and paid for by your credit card?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t tend to be something we give a lot of thought to. Maybe once a year when you get a domain renewal notice. Or when a site has a security breach and you&amp;rsquo;re advised to change your password. But it&amp;rsquo;s something our team deals with regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So and so has left the company and&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; begins a lot of emails we receive. Some employee has set up an account with their email address, registered the company&amp;rsquo;s domain(s), and paid for them with their credit card. And now no one knows the login, the email address no longer works, and the credit card has been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;rsquo;re lucky, they figure this out &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the website and email stop working, but not always. As often as not the emails we get are somewhat panicked. But while we understand customers&amp;rsquo; predicaments in these cases, we can&amp;rsquo;t just hand over the keys, so to speak. We need to authenticate who has access to the account, who owns the domains(s), etc., to prevent straight-up theft. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to end up dealing with one of these situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you keep your online properties up to date, and make sure those who need administrative access to accounts can get it when needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Avoid registering business accounts or domains with personal information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;What will happen if you can&amp;rsquo;t access an account or there&amp;rsquo;s a dispute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;What will happen if you die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Just part of being a grownup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Avoid registering business accounts or domains with personal information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty common for things like domains and social media accounts to be assigned to a primary person. Since you&amp;rsquo;re asked for personal details like name and email address (and sometimes &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to provide an individual information rather than company information), it seems like a no-brainer to use your own details. If you can avoid that, do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use an organizational email address that more than one person has access to. That way others will have the login, or at the very least can get and use a password reset email if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to use an individual&amp;rsquo;s name on an account, so be it, use yours or an administrative one, but be sure to include the organization&amp;rsquo;s name in the &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt; field as well. It provides some link to the company if we hear from someone who&amp;rsquo;s not the main contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware when registering domains that the registrant or owner contact name is the legal owner of the domain. Even if the person worked for your company and registered the domain on behalf of the company. If the registrant contact says John Smith, it&amp;rsquo;s legally John Smith&amp;rsquo;s domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, register the domain under the company name, not a person&amp;rsquo;s name. Note that our system automatically adds the account contact information as the registrant information, but you can update that in your dashboard under &lt;strong&gt;edit contacts&lt;/strong&gt;, or, in some cases (like ccTLDs), we can do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, use a corporate credit card under the company or organization&amp;rsquo;s name. There&amp;rsquo;s (perhaps) a better chance of someone tracking its use and when expiry dates will need to be updated, for example. The more data points we have for the organization, the easier it will be to prove who owns or should have access to the account and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there&amp;rsquo;s an issue of account access, we request proof of ID for the account holder and a partial scan of the card on the account. Take a look at your account details and ask yourself if anyone else would be able to provide them if you&amp;rsquo;re not around to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;What will happen if you can&#39;t access an account or there&#39;s a dispute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, we require an assortment of proof of identification and ownership. At worst, if there seems to be an issue, or information isn&amp;rsquo;t clear, we lock down accounts while we wait for more information (for as long as necessary&amp;hellip;even if your website and email are down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means no party can access it, which means if a credit card is invalid, domains can&amp;rsquo;t be renewed and may expire and be lost. If something goes wrong with DNS or hosting, a site may remain offline or emails will bounce. You can imagine this could be a serious problem for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s just a customer who&amp;rsquo;s forgotten a password, we can send a password reset email, or do our standard authentication to help them get back into their own account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one party claims another party has left a company, for example, and they need access to the account for the domains, we will take a look at the account. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what evidence there is that the domains belong to the company. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what other domains are in the account. (We&amp;rsquo;re not going to hand over account access if there&amp;rsquo;s one company domain and 10 that appear to be personal and unrelated.) We will ask for authentication documentation for the company, alleged former employee, person asking for access, and whatever else we feel is necessary to prove ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take customer account security very seriously, which can be frustrating for some people. But just imagine someone was trying to get access to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; accounts or domains. Would you want us to hand over access just based on an email saying, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me in&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;What will happen if you die&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s up to you. Some people may want their web properties&amp;rsquo; content archived, or their friends or families might. Some people might want everything to eventually expire and be deleted. Some people might have secret accounts or profiles they don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty common, in addition to a formal will, to have a more informal list of requests, bequests, or instructions. We&amp;rsquo;d recommend adding a section about your digital properties there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re big fans of password management programs, and if you use one of those, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you just need to keep track of one password. Record it with your will and any related documents. Remember to update it when you update your password(s). Then someone will be able to maintain or remove your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedigitalbeyond.com/online-services-list/&#34;&gt;There are also a variety of sites and tools to help manage digital legacies.&lt;/a&gt; Whether it&amp;rsquo;s checking regularly whether you&amp;rsquo;re still alive or not, sending out posthumous messages to loved ones, providing a place for those who cared about you to memorialize you, or wiping accounts or files you don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone else to know about, handling our digital afterlives can be well covered.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that a lot of work can go into sorting things out and tying up loose ends after someone dies, and the people left doing it are often tired, sad, and stressed. It&amp;rsquo;s a kindness to make these arrangements in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Just part of being a grownup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally we complain that websites or apps want too much personal information from us when we try to set up accounts or start using them. But in general, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to create new digital footprints online. It&amp;rsquo;s actually often harder to erase them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, many of us give little thought to how broad our digital presences and properties actually are. Sure, many of us have plenty of little-used and abandoned accounts. They don&amp;rsquo;t cost us time or money (maybe a little email spam). But many of us &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have online presences and properties that are important to us, and to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For various reasons, if and when we&amp;rsquo;re not around to take care of them, like any good property management, it&amp;rsquo;s the grownup and responsible thing to do to make sure someone else can.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Anyone can build a small business website (even you)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonly told tale is that website building is for &amp;ldquo;computer geniuses&amp;rdquo; who&amp;rsquo;ve been churning out complicated code for much of their waking lives. But it&amp;rsquo;s not true. Sure, building a massive site for a global corporation is a huge undertaking, but the tools exist, right now, for small business owners of any computer skill level to quickly create beautiful sites and online stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Step 1: Get a domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Step 2: Choose a website platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Step 3: Install your domain to your website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Step 4: Get a custom email address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Step 1: Get a domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a domain name, particularly the part after the dot (as in BUSINESSNAME dot COM), may seem like an arbitrary task, but it&amp;rsquo;s your first step to establishing legitimacy. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of content on the web that goes over this in some detail—including &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/how-to-pick-the-right-domain-extension.html&#34;&gt;our guide&lt;/a&gt;—but let&amp;rsquo;s reframe it here from a traditional business perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of your domain as the location of your shop. As with a shop, you generally want to be front-and-center on the best street in town (location, location, location!) to get the most traffic. In the world of domains, here&amp;rsquo;s how the city is layed out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COM = Main Street, and the shorter your domain is, the closer you are to the center of town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popular extensions (the ones you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of) like .CO, .NET, .IO, and your country&amp;rsquo;s ccTLD (like .NZ for New Zealand) = other streets near the center of town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.PIZZA, .CLUB, and the new gTLDs = the suburbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any business, if you&amp;rsquo;re on top of your game, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where you&amp;rsquo;re located. But at the moment, businesses are thought to be more legitimate if they&amp;rsquo;re not in an obscure location. Legitimacy is a fickle thing though—new domain extensions, like new suburbs, can grow quickly. So don&amp;rsquo;t let the fact that the domain you want in the .COM namespace is taken hold you back from starting a website. (But if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in buying that killer .COM from its current owner, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-getting-the-right-domain-name-for-your-brand.html&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;rsquo;s perhaps more in your control is what goes before the dot. Here&amp;rsquo;s the basic rule: go with the name of your brand in its simplest form—don&amp;rsquo;t add identifiers that don&amp;rsquo;t belong like &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo;. So if your business name is Layshock Limo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;layshocklimo.com = good
layshock.limo = in the suburbs, but it&amp;rsquo;s short and memorable, which is good
ridelayshocklimo.com = not as good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Does your domain name have a sketchy past?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, you can name your website anything you want, but like all things, names come with histories. Even if you have a sparkling marketing plan, getting unfavorable search results when seeking your site can be a killer. So do your research. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little video guide from Matt Cutts of Google Webmasters on how you can protect yourself from registering domain names with iffy histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-EdhaMDXho&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, here are his three three main tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a &amp;ldquo;site: DOMAINNAME.com&amp;rdquo; search. If you see anything fishy, be weary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for the domain name without the domain extension. So instead of &amp;ldquo;site: DOMAINNAME.com&amp;rdquo;, just search for &amp;ldquo;DOMAINNAME.&amp;rdquo; You never know what you might find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for your desired domain on &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. If your site used to be a scam site, you could suffer a continued SEO hit. Also note that if your site used to be something you find unsavory, you may get residual unsavory emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Step 2: Choose a website platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the complicated part—or what used to be the complicated part. Ten years ago, creating a website meant finding some server space, installing your platform of choice onto that server space, then messing with some combination of a template (which meant a good deal of trial and error, even after learning some rudimentary coding skills) and some plugins until you&amp;rsquo;ve created something you&amp;rsquo;re remotely happy with. E-commerce was always tricky, keeping things updated was always a chore, and if you forgot to backup your site&amp;hellip; kapow! All gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things today are quite different. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;iwantmyname Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;ve cultivated a number of platforms that do it all. The templates are all professionally made and are often able to be changed with simple drag-and-drop interfaces. And they come stock with tools that make online shopping, marketing, and once-difficult tasks like displaying photo galleries and menus as easy as could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, be sure to do a little research before picking the platform to want to go with. Platforms vary greatly in price, features, and general ease-of-use, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to find what&amp;rsquo;s best for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few to start your search with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what kind of site you&amp;rsquo;re looking to build, Squarespace has the tools you need. Just to list, they have templates and tools designed for businesses, online shopping sites, physical stores, restaurants (with amazing location and menu features), musicians, podcast hosts (you can serve shows directly from Squarespace to iTunes), photographers, and painters. And they&amp;rsquo;re adding new tools and features all the time, so the platform never gets stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address&#34;&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions, decisions. In a lot of ways, Weebly is a lot like Squarespace. They have great online shopping solutions, offer simple drag-and-drop tools for website creation, and have some beautiful templates to choose from. Fortunately, you can try both out for free before you decide to plop your money down—so we&amp;rsquo;d recommend that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re an artist, photographer, builder, sewer, or anyone making beautiful goods, Big Cartel is an e-commerce-only solution to check out. Their platform is extremely easy to use (they&amp;rsquo;ve been building it up since 2005), they specialize in showing off independent makers, and they&amp;rsquo;re still small enough to give you some honest personal attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Step 3: Install your domain to your website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. As. Pie. When you log in and look at your domains, you&amp;rsquo;ll see an Apps &amp;amp; Services column to the right of your domains. Just click &amp;ldquo;Install new service,&amp;rdquo; pick the platform you want, and follow the simple directions (it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much a one-click solution). And that&amp;rsquo;s it! (If you have any trouble though, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Step 4: Get a custom email address&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the secret sauce for having a successful small business site. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do real business, contacting customers and clients with an @gmail.com, @me.com, or @yahoo.com address is a nightmare for legitimacy. Those are free email services that anyone can sign up and use! (Just think about it—would you be more likely to respond to tim@apple.com or appletim@me.com?) What you need is an email address that&amp;rsquo;s attached to your domain, and it&amp;rsquo;s way easier to setup than you think. Just &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-guide-to-getting-your-own-custom-email-address.html&#34;&gt;head over to our simple guide&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The iwantmyname guide to blogging (and actually owning your content)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Math is hard. Running a marathon is hard. Writing on the web, no matter what anyone tells you, is not hard. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s become so easy that you pick up a following writing nothing more than 140 character messages riddled with abbreviated words, hashtags, and @ replies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s hard is writing words that matter. Evergreen content. Posts that, in a decade, people will still be able to read and discuss. This kind of writing requires a bit of planning, a bit of structure, and a willingness to forego the immediate &amp;ldquo;viral-ness&amp;rdquo; of social media—but if you stick with it, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a real collection of content that&amp;rsquo;ll withstand the fickle nature of the social web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Beware purely social platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;re internet famous, branding is important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Choosing the right blog hosting platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Always have an exit plan in mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;Your domain name matters, but maybe less than you think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Beware purely social platforms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-scoble-why-im-still-betting-my-future-on-google-2011-9&#34;&gt;From Robert Scoble, circa 2011:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you best capture the EMOTION of your time? Blogging? Not for me anymore. Tweeting? Not for me anymore (I will continue being there, mostly to let people who won&amp;rsquo;t leave that system know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and where I&amp;rsquo;m doing it &amp;mdash; it has turned into a UI for my Facebook and Google behaviors). Facebooking? Yes. I&amp;rsquo;m still there and will be for forseeable future at &lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com/robertscoble&#34;&gt;http://facebook.com/robertscoble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my hub is Google+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a past life, Robert Scoble was one of the many go-to industry insiders worth reading. But for most of this decade, he&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pivoted&amp;rdquo; from blogging to social media to pursue the active engagement social media brings—and has been a pretty vocal advocate for the rest of us doing the same. His results though don&amp;rsquo;t seem all that rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 1 is his love affair with Google+. He poured years of content into that platform, amassed nearly seven million followers, and is now perhaps the biggest boat on a dried up lake. Google+ is pretty much a dead platform these days, and the content on it might as well not exist. Now, Scoble&amp;rsquo;s primarily on Facebook, posting multiple times a day on a platform known for spotty content delivery unless you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay to promote it. (On a personal note, our Facebook posts routinely get delivered to only 15% of our audience—hardly something we&amp;rsquo;d like to pour too much time into.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibit 2 is his standing on Google Trends, which tracks news headlines over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-08-31-scoble-trend.png&#34; alt=&#34;Scoble trend&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying there&amp;rsquo;s a one-to-one correlation between his move to social and his flagging popularity (on Google Trends), but from an outsider&amp;rsquo;s perspective, the move certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it&amp;rsquo;s helping his newsworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Unless you&#39;re internet famous, branding is important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest negative with social media is that with it, you&amp;rsquo;re forever tied to the platform you&amp;rsquo;re on. Modern social sites have little-to-no customization (Facebook, Twitter, and Medium look the same no matter what page you&amp;rsquo;re on), their URL structure is almost universally www.platformname.com/username, and they all come with unique baggage. Platform X is for this clique; Platform Y used to be cool until the adults arrived, etc., etc. Really, unless you&amp;rsquo;re internet famous (like Robert Scoble), fighting this uphill branding battle on social media sites seems crazy. Having a blog on a custom domain might not give the immediate gratification of a Facebook Like, but it&amp;rsquo;s still the best way to seem like a person who should be taken seriously on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, with a custom domain name, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-guide-to-getting-your-own-custom-email-address.html&#34;&gt;pair your credible blog with a custom email address&lt;/a&gt; (a big deal if your blog ever gets media attention).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Choosing the right blog hosting platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know that there is no &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; blog platform. Every platform will have a different set of pros and cons, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to do a little research to match your needs. Do you like writing in Markdown? Do you want extra site-building features on top of general blogging? Do you want your files to be stored in a Dropbox folder instead of a closed cloud? Is price a concern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few options from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to start with, broken down by what they do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;General website builders (with blog functionality)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address&#34;&gt;Weebly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blog hosting platforms:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postagon-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Postagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/posthaven-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Posthaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/silvrback-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Silvrback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;WordPress hosting:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/wpengine-wordpress-custom-domain&#34;&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/register-custom-domain-page.ly&#34;&gt;Page.ly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Based on Dropbox or Evernote (content stays on your computer):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postachio&#34;&gt;Postach.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For developers:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/setup-custom-domain-amazon-s3&#34;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Always have an exit plan in mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s nice about owning your own domain is that if you don&amp;rsquo;t like the blog platform you&amp;rsquo;re on, you can move without confusing your readers. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re blogging on Ghost one day, then realize you want to start leveraging your personal brand to start selling things online the next, you can migrate your content to Squarespace without losing your domain. Plus, because you already have a domain and you&amp;rsquo;re not moving to a closed social platform, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about your brand name being taken on the next platform you&amp;rsquo;re headed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before you make any platform decision, be sure to look for a solid import/export tool. Make sure you can easily take all your content with you in case you want to jump platforms—and don&amp;rsquo;t compromise. Better and better platforms are coming out all the time, so getting stuck with something you&amp;rsquo;re not happy with is solely on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;Your domain name matters, but maybe less than you think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a killer domain name is a nice thing when you&amp;rsquo;re telling your friends about your site, but as the spread of content moves to social, it matters less now than ever. Remember that while social media isn&amp;rsquo;t great as your primary content bucket, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely good for spreading your content. Articles from your blog might get tweeted, posted, retweeted, commented on, etc., and on social media, the quality of the domain names means a lot less than the quality of the person posting the message (for example, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t click on an strange site sent from a complete stranger, but you might if it were sent from your best friend).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media sharing aside, your primary objective when choosing a domain name is to not look like a spam site. &lt;a href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain&#34;&gt;Here are some simple tips from Moz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid hyphens. Hyphens detract from credibility and can act as a spam indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-level domains (like .com) are the extensions associated with domain names. For best ranking results, avoid uncommon top-level domains (TLDs). Like hyphens, TLDs such as .info, .cc, .ws, and .name are spam indicators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid domain names longer than 15 characters. Short domain names are easier to remember, easier to share, and have a smaller chance of resulting in typos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Get your personal brand in tip-top shape</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re an adult of a certain age, the idea of a personal brand is a fascinating concept. A few decades ago, your personal brand boiled down to how you dressed, where you worked, and what social clubs you were a part of. But now your personal brand follows you everywhere on the web. It&amp;rsquo;s your social network, your resume, your photos, and quips. It&amp;rsquo;s a pervasive, evolving mass, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t cultivate it correctly, bits of your identity can erode without much thought. So let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at how you can get your personal brand in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Nothing is permanent on the social web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;It starts to matter when your personal brand goes pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Getting the right domain extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;Your personal brand needs a custom email address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;Thoughts on reserving the digital future of your child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Nothing is permanent on the social web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the rub. Social media has made it easier than ever before in history to spread your ideas and actions online. Have a baby? Posting a picture on Facebook is easier than making instant coffee. Have a thought? Tweet it in two seconds. Want to write something long form? Medium will get it to the world in a snap. But you don&amp;rsquo;t own this content. Your baby picture is Facebook&amp;rsquo;s baby picture, on Facebook&amp;rsquo;s layout, with Facebook&amp;rsquo;s targeted ads hovering nearby (remember, on most social networks, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t the customer, the advertisers are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lot of people, this situation is fine. But think about it for a second. The social web is only in its infancy. Facebook, Twitter, Medium—in 10 years, do you think you&amp;rsquo;ll still be using them? If not, where will that content go? Without a brand hub, you have nothing permanent—it&amp;rsquo;s like having a lot of friends with couches to sleep on, but no home. Looking long term, that&amp;rsquo;s a scary proposition. Especially if you ever want your personal brand to go pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;It starts to matter when your personal brand goes pro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a local artist the other day about how to leverage his online persona into real sales, and there&amp;rsquo;s no simple answer. But there are a few key points to note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Your central hub can&amp;rsquo;t be a social network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a creator of things, your livelihood relies on people consistently being able to find you. You need a home that can withstand the whims of the market—remember, MySpace was the biggest thing on the web only a decade ago, and it&amp;rsquo;s not like people could just move that content to another platform with the same domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, be wary of using closed platforms with big social components as your main sales hub. The artist I was talking to had moved the majority of his sales over to Etsy, but once you go that route, you give up nearly all control over the experience. Your domain will have etsy.com in it, the site will look like an Etsy site, and most importantly, your brand will become tied to Etsy&amp;rsquo;s. Just think about it. Do you really want your brand to be an Etsy store? Maybe so, maybe no—but you can&amp;rsquo;t deny the existence of a brand connotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a more analytics-geared answer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://moz.com/blog/answers-to-4-excellent-seo-questions&#34;&gt;Rand Fishkin of Moz says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d always bias to taking the website over the social media presence. It&amp;rsquo;s not that a great Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare or LinkedIn account aren&amp;rsquo;t great, it&amp;rsquo;s just that the flexibility, power, branding and measurability of a website has yet to be matched on any platform. With a website, you can custom build virtually any form of analytics, leverage any type of web technology to display/deliver content and control your own destiny. Even if Facebook or some other new, wholly flexible platform allowed for all of these features, you would still never truly own your home on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge supporter of and advocate for social media marketing, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could ever endorse having your primary base of marketing and acquisition happen anywhere but on a site you fully own and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Social media is a wonderful &lt;em&gt;marketing&lt;/em&gt; tool&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyword is &lt;em&gt;marketing&lt;/em&gt;. And on the marketing front, you should do all you can create authentic experiences that touch as many people as possible. But whether you do daily process shots on Instagram, talk to fans on Twitter, or organize events on Facebook, the key here is consistency. Like a good blog, you&amp;rsquo;re never going to build an audience with inconsistent posts—but unlike a blog, the instant consumability of social media requires you to be posting &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously. Daily Instagram posts, hourly tweets, twice-weekly Facebook events. Once you&amp;rsquo;re a part of someone else&amp;rsquo;s stream, you&amp;rsquo;re competing against the 100+ other things that person is following. It might seem like a lot, but the marketing benefits of having thousands of followers is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Getting the right domain extension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, personal branding is the hardest of all the branding types. Seriously. (How many failed aliases have you tried to use in the last decade? I&amp;rsquo;m at three.). But now that the new generic top-level domains have launched, getting your real name on the left side of the dot is easier than ever. So what domain extension do you want on the other side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking the right one can be tricky, and there are a number of things you should consider before making your choice. Let&amp;rsquo;s break down some of your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.COM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious choice for your personal site is yourname.com, and that&amp;rsquo;s probably the choice I&amp;rsquo;d make if it were available to me. If your name is rare enough for this to even be an option, your only real consideration should be whether you should go with lastname.com or fullname.com. I personally prefer lastname.com, because email addresses like chris@hall.com look nicer than chris@chrishall.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.CO and .ME&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&#34;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; seem to be the next most common choices for personal sites. And in 2012, they were excellent choices, if only because they freed you from the confines of the .COM namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the flood of new domain extensions allow me to be picky, and I do have some concerns with these specific two. Starting with .CO, my primary concern is spelling errors—particularly with people unconsciously adding an &amp;ldquo;m&amp;rdquo; to .CO when sending emails. .ME is a little safer in that no one will mistake it for another extension, but I always wonder if people think .ME has an Apple affiliation due to the recently retired Mobile Me (I still regularly use my @me.com email address).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Your local ccTLD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are super popular around the world (aside for the US), and they make for wonderful personal domain names. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re a designer who does the bulk of your work in New Zealand, picking up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&#34;&gt;.NZ&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&#34;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;) domain name is a great choice. Due to popularity, many basic names will already be taken, but if your parents were adventurous types, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance your name will be available (I desperately tried to rename myself Bowser as a child, and BowserHall is available in just about every extension).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Letters and phrases you identify with&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very similar topic was brought up recently on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8466018&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the replies fits perfectly into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the .gg TLD. My personal site is bram.gg and my email is hello@bram.gg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.gg is my favorite TLD, and the most underrated. It&amp;rsquo;s expensive enough that the domain you want probably isn&amp;rsquo;t taken, but cheap enough that it&amp;rsquo;s worth the price if it&amp;rsquo;s something you care about. &amp;ldquo;gg&amp;rdquo; is also a common phrase in gaming subculture, meaning &amp;ldquo;good game&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now going with something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gg-channel-island-domain-name-registration-for-guernsey&#34;&gt;.GG&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;ldquo;good game&amp;rdquo; is a viable option, but I&amp;rsquo;d be a little concerned about longevity. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you keep this domain for 20 years—are you going to be ok with &amp;ldquo;good game&amp;rdquo; when you&amp;rsquo;re 40? 50?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, a similar concern goes for extensions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wtf&#34;&gt;.WTF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rocks&#34;&gt;.ROCKS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ninja&#34;&gt;.NINJA&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cool&#34;&gt;.COOL&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re a 40-year-old who genuinely, unquestionably rocks, then go for it, but if you&amp;rsquo;re 17 going with a .NINJA domain, will you be cool with it when you&amp;rsquo;re 37?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Career specific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new gTLDs also allow for people to self-identify with their careers. So if you&amp;rsquo;re a photographer, you could use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos&#34;&gt;.photos&lt;/a&gt; extension. Or if you&amp;rsquo;re an engineer, you could go with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-engineer&#34;&gt;.engineer&lt;/a&gt; domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going for longer, more specific domains, there are two things you should consider. First, how confident are you that you&amp;rsquo;ll stay in that career forever? Are you sure you&amp;rsquo;re not going to quit your job and become a brewmaster (&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&#34;&gt;.BEER&lt;/a&gt; in the next five years? And second, be mindful of length. There&amp;rsquo;s an American football player named Michael Hoomanawanui, and if he retires and becomes a photographer, hoomanawanui.photography probably isn&amp;rsquo;t his best option for a domain name (24 characters is incredibly long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Domain hacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain hacks won&amp;rsquo;t work for everyone, but if you want to get clever, you could do a lot worse than finding the ccTLD that fits into your name. Some common name-enders are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&#34;&gt;.ES&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/am-armenian-domain-name-registration-for-armenia&#34;&gt;.AM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/at-austrian-domain-name-registration-for-austria&#34;&gt;.AT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/be-belgian-domain-name-registration-for-belgium&#34;&gt;.BE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ch-swiss-domain-name-registration-for-switzerland&#34;&gt;.CH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&#34;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/my-malaysian-domain-name-registration-for-malaysia&#34;&gt;.MY&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sh-domain-name-registration-for-saint-helena&#34;&gt;.SH&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, .LL (ha.ll) isn&amp;rsquo;t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, just about anything you choose will be fine as long as you stick with it (isn&amp;rsquo;t that always the lesson?). The goal of a personal domain is for people to be able to find you, and if you stay in the same place long enough, they likely will. Just know that no matter what domain extension you go with, it&amp;rsquo;ll be better than sending people to Facebook or LinkedIn to discover who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Platforms for creating a personal website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you get too bogged down with actually creating your personal site, be sure to take a quick inventory of your current and potential needs. Are you just looking for an anchor for your various social handles and blog articles? Are you looking for a portfolio site to help you get a job? Are you trying to sell something? Once you know what your needs are, your search will be infinitely less complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a sample (not an exhaustive list) of platforms in our Marketplace that will help you get started with a custom domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For a quick personal landing page: about.me&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the big site builders that do it all, &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.me&#34;&gt;about.me&lt;/a&gt; acts more like your business card, online. In short, about.me allows you to put up a representative picture of yourself, basic CV-type information, and links to all your works on the web. It&amp;rsquo;s simple to use, easy to maintain, and is a great way to anchor your internet self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;If you express yourself through blog posts: Ghost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; is a super clean blog platform that makes it easy to get your words published. What&amp;rsquo;s neat about Ghost though is that it&amp;rsquo;s growing at a steady clip, yet isn&amp;rsquo;t part of a wider social network like Tumblr (or Medium, which is a double ouch in that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you use custom domains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For making online stores: Big Cartel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;maker, designer, musician, or other artist&amp;rdquo; looking for a platforms to sell stuff, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bigcartel.com&#34;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt; has all the tools you need.  And it gives you a nice social component as well, as Big Cartel has been cultivating and promoting great indie stores for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;If you want to do it all: Squarespace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you want to do on the web, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squarespace.com&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; can help you create it. It does blogs, portfolios, stores, simple pages—heck, it&amp;rsquo;ll even host your podcast. But most impressive is the array of themes Squarespace provides, giving you the flexibility to make your site look any way you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;Your personal brand needs a custom email address&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve created your website, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to create the custom email address to go along with it (especially if your personal brand is &amp;ldquo;going pro&amp;rdquo;). You&amp;rsquo;ll look a far more savvy with an @YOURNAME.com address than the gmail.com or yahoo.com alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to make this happen, be sure to read our guide on &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-guide-to-getting-your-own-custom-email-address.html&#34;&gt;how to get your own custom email address&lt;/a&gt; (there&amp;rsquo;s even a free option!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;Thoughts on reserving the digital future of your child&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve really gone off the deep end. Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit from Alexander Taub in Forbes’ &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2012/10/25/the-mad-rush-to-reserve-your-childs-digital-future&#34;&gt;The Mad Rush To Reserve Your Child’s Digital Future&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been noticing a trend over the past few months. I have a lot of friends who are having their first child. Many of these friends, especially the ones who work in the technology space, are reserving and managing the handles, email addresses, and websites of their newborns. They believe that when their child comes of age, the good handles, email addresses, websites, and digital accounts will be much harder to come by. By 2025, Jonathan.Smith@gmail.com or @jonsmith equivalents will definitely not be available. You may have to settle for @jonsmith13 or Jsmith13@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thought? Skip the gmail. Skip all the social media platforms that might not exist in a decade. Instead, register a solid domain name for your child—domain names, unlike social media, will be there when your child wants it, and custom email addresses are always cooler than their closed-platform alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to keep your passwords and logins safe</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security is one of those things that no one wants to think about, but we all need to be paying attention to. Moving around today&amp;rsquo;s internet requires more than the short password you&amp;rsquo;ve been using since 1998, and no, adding a capital letter at the beginning probably isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. To really be safe, you need strong passwords and extra layers of authentication when logging in to sites—and for most people, you&amp;rsquo;ll need apps to help you keep track of it all. Here&amp;rsquo;s our primer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;The best ways to manage your passwords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Use 2FA for an extra layer of protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;The best ways to keep your passwords safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard over the past half-decade making domain registration as easy as possible, but one pain point we often encounter is password memorization. The vast majority of our customers simply don&amp;rsquo;t need to interact with us very often, and what seems like a strong, easily remembered password could be completely alien when domain renewals come around a year later. But there are solutions for this very problem—all you need is a solid password manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an intro to password managers from &lt;a href=&#34;The paranoid guide to digital security&#34;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is straightforward: You sign up for a service that generates and stores a unique, strong password for each of the websites where you need log-in credentials. You can do that yourself if you have a savant-like memory for numbers, but in all likelihood you don’t. Then, you just need to remember one, excellent password in order to access the service. Yes, you may ask, but what if the password manager gets hacked? Not to worry, says Chris Soghoian. “Password managers encrypt their data, so these services are safe. And, ultimately, in 2015 it’s not a good idea to use the same password for more than one website. That effectively means that you have to outsource the task.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1Password&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-11-one-password.png&#34; alt=&#34;1Password&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that acts as a vault for all your passwords, secured by a single password of your creation. Basically, using a browser extension (available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera), app, or smartphone app, you can open your vault with your master password and have instant access to all the passwords you&amp;rsquo;ve created, on any device you happen to be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little excerpt from an extremely in-depth piece by the Sweet Setup, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-password-manager-and-why-you-need-one/&#34;&gt;The best password manager (and why you need one) &amp;ndash; 1Password&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, 1Password is the best app for managing your passwords because it does the best job of taking hold of our slippery digital identity, all the myriad digital bits of ourselves we use to prove who we are, and helps ease the friction of our travels through the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another glowing review from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macstories.net/reviews/1password-4-for-mac-review/&#34;&gt;MacStories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time a new version of 1Password comes out, I feel like repeating myself: if you’re serious about your secure data and web logins, you need 1Password. While it’s a great thing that Apple will be providing native options for increased password security and form-filling with iCloud Keychain, my recommendation still goes to 1Password if you’re looking for a dedicated app with more and better options aimed at managing your passwords, login details, credit card information, software licenses, and more. iCloud Keychain is meant for Safari, whereas 1Password is system-wide, powered by great customizable menus with keyboard shortcuts, and goes beyond web logins to let you encrypt and protect just about anything. I can’t work without 1Password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;LastPass&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-11-lastpass.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;LastPass&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good password manager is &lt;a href=&#34;https://lastpass.com&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, which works basically the same way 1Password does, but with a few less bells and whistles (although LastPass has been making huge strides), and a cheaper price (there&amp;rsquo;s a free option!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit from PC Mag&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426798,00.asp&#34;&gt;LastPass 3.0 review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing all of your passwords in a single, secure password manager means you can use a different, strong password for every site, without worrying that you&amp;rsquo;ll forget. It also means that a successful attack on your password stash could give a hacker access to every one of your secure sites. If that thought worries you, the free LastPass 3.0 is just what you need. Your data is stored online in encrypted form that even the company can&amp;rsquo;t read, and it&amp;rsquo;s encrypted going to and from your PCs. You can protect your LastPass data with more different kinds of two-factor authentication than any other password manager I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dashlane&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-11-dashlane.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dashlane&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dashlane.com&#34;&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to the other password managers on the market (if you want details, David Pogue wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/technology/personaltech/too-many-passwords-and-no-way-to-remember-them-until-now.html&#34;&gt;very positive review&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times, as did &lt;a href=&#34;http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/12/09/dashlanes-automatic-password-changer-makes-precious-accounts-less-hackable/&#34;&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt; in late 2014), but a new feature dropped in December that makes it extremely enticing. Here&amp;rsquo;s the description from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7357251/dashlane-can-now-change-all-your-passwords-with-a-single-click-and&#34;&gt;the Verge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashlane, the subscription-based password management service, is introducing a feature today that ought to become standard in every product like it: the ability to change all your passwords with a single click, including accounts with two-factor authentication enabled. The feature will work with about 75 major websites at launch, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, PayPal, Pinterest, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Password Changer, as the feature is called, is made possible by Dashlane’s acquisition of PassOmatic, a New York startup that developed the core technology. For now, it works on desktop versions of Dashlane for PC and Mac, though the company is working on a mobile version. Dashlane now includes a big green &amp;ldquo;change all passwords&amp;rdquo; button; click it, and it will replace your existing passwords with ones that are unique and randomly generated. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, a pop-up will ask you for a code or for the answer to a security question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Safari Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid the master password thing and just want a simple password storage system, the Safari Password Manager is a pretty nice tool. Basically, when you&amp;rsquo;re setting up an account online, Safari can auto-generate and save a secure password that will sync via iCloud Keychain for you to use on any device. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy, but for some, it might be too easy. Here&amp;rsquo;s a specific pain point, from the pro-1Password &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-password-manager-and-why-you-need-one/&#34;&gt;Sweet Setup&lt;/a&gt; article above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different people also have different levels of comfort with iCloud Keychain. I, for one, don’t actually love the frictionless experience. I want to be intentional about how I use my passwords and my credit card information, and I like how 1Password makes me conscious of when I’m using those things. I also like how I have more control over access to my information on my devices. I can require a login to 1Password after not using it for even a few minutes. I also like that if my daughter is using my iPad, she can’t easily hop over to Zappos and buy herself a new pair of shoes with my credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Use 2FA for an extra layer of protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, making your online self more secure seems like a no-brainer. Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t want to get hacked. Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t want your identity to be stolen. But at what length are you willing to go to ensure your safety?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One easy (and totally free) step we recommend you take for every platform that supports it is two-factor authentication (2FA). Stripping technical jargon, 2FA makes it so that in order to login to your account, you have to type in a code that&amp;rsquo;s only accessible on your phone. So if Hacker X tries to access your account, they&amp;rsquo;ll need the code sitting on your phone to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s something we think is really important, so here&amp;rsquo;s a quick look at how to set it up, and what using it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login to your account, then select &amp;ldquo;Login &amp;amp; Security&amp;rdquo; under the &amp;ldquo;Account&amp;rdquo; dropdown menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &amp;ldquo;Two-step verification&amp;rdquo; type in your phone number and country code, then download the Authy app for iOS or Android (an SMS text option is available if you&amp;rsquo;re on an unsupported platform).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-01-2fa-setup.png&#34; alt=&#34;2FA setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using 2FA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;re all setup, your login will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-01-authy-login.png&#34; alt=&#34;Authy login&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just open up your Authy app (or SMS text) and type in the code provided—and that&amp;rsquo;s it. You&amp;rsquo;ve quickly—and painlessly—added a second level of security to your iwantmyname account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-01-2fa.png&#34; alt=&#34;Authy&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;But will this get annoying?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The million dollar question. Yes, adding 2FA will make logging into your iwantmyname account a touch more cumbersome, but we&amp;rsquo;re not a Bitcoin platform you&amp;rsquo;re logging into every day. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you probably only mess with your account once a month—or less. And at five seconds per login (the Authy codes expires every 20 seconds, so even if you&amp;rsquo;re slow, it can only take that long), you&amp;rsquo;re only looking at losing a few seconds of your life a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s a really small price to pay for peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Find more information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to find more information about Authy, here are a few good places to start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find answers to common questions, or ask your own, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.authy.com/faq&#34;&gt;Authy FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet Authy &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Authy&#34;&gt;@authy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authy has 11 informational videos on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/user13020702/videos&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re interested in integrating Authy to your platform, &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/two-factor-auth-using-authy--net-33402&#34;&gt;here’s an introduction on Tuts+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re big fans of DigitalOcean, and they have a great article titled, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-authy-and-configure-two-factor-authentication-for-ssh&#34;&gt;How To Install Authy And Configure Two-Factor Authentication For SSH&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>.COM? .IO? .PIZZA? How to pick the right domain extension (TLD)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ye olde days (early 2013), most of the hard thinking that went into choosing a domain name went to the part before the dot. But now, with hundreds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; available to the public, the actual name of your site might be the easy part.  How do you choose between all the options? Do you go with .COM? .CO? Your local ccTLD? A descriptive word that aligns with your brand? Maybe .PIZZA (pizza goes with everything!)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you spontaneously combust, let&amp;rsquo;s go through your options and add some notes from the smart people writing about the subject on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;.COM, the big Kahuna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Beware spam indicators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Local ccTLDs and gTLDs can be good for business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;.IO and the TLDs for tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;Are some TLDs better for reaching an international audience?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;Is it ok to use a new gTLD?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-7&#34;&gt;Does your TLD really matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;.COM, the big Kahuna&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-23-big-kahuna.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Big Kahuna Burger&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a mind reader, but my guess is that you&amp;rsquo;re here to have someone like me tell you it&amp;rsquo;s ok to get something other than a .COM. So, sure, you certainly can run a successful business using any TLD. But for many people, .COM &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the internet, especially if you live in the US. And it goes beyond simple. familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take John Smith, a hypothetical 49-year-old insurance adjuster in Columbus, Ohio (in the US). On a given day, he browses through his typical sites: cnn.com, espn.com, facebook.com, and his work website, then he checks his email through Apple Mail which was set up for him at the Apple Store when he got his computer. The only thing he&amp;rsquo;ll come across that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; is the spam that sometimes makes it to his inbox. And all that spam usually has one thing in common—garbledygook. The text is sometimes in a foreign language, or at best, a broken attempt at his primary language. The email address probably has hyphens and numbers. And the links (if there is a link) often have misspellings and unfamiliar TLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now imagine marketing your brand to John Smith. You could have a clean site with a clear business plan, but your non-.COM instantly registers as something out of the ordinary. Something potentially unsafe. And because John has been trained at his office for the last two decades to avoid anything remotely unfamiliar on the web (people are deathly afraid of getting hacked), he might not click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember that while more and more people are working tech jobs and building websites every day, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/millennials-are-more-scared-of-the-internet-than-their-grandparents.html/?a=viewall&#34;&gt;a big portion of the public still sees the internet as a dangerous place&lt;/a&gt; too often run by teenage wunderkinds. And with every new story that breaks about privacy concerns and data theft, that fear of the unknown grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, people do gradually adapt to change. 15 years ago, buying something online with a credit card seemed like science fiction, and now we all have so many monthly subscriptions we can&amp;rsquo;t even keep up. What seems weird and dangerous today could be the societal norm by the end of the year, and everyone knows it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Beware spam indicators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-23-scary-rails.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;scary&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated about, if your website looks like it could be spam, that&amp;rsquo;s not a good thing. Here&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;a href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain&#34;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;, the popular SEO site, says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For best ranking results, avoid uncommon top-level domains (TLDs). Like hyphens, TLDs such as .info, .cc, .ws, and .name are spam indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that short list, the new gTLDs have created so many new outlets for spammers to exploit (although it looks like the new gTLDs are still &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/17447-phishers-prefer-free-cctlds-to-new-gtlds&#34;&gt;less commonly used than discount/free ccTLDs&lt;/a&gt;). My recommendation would be to avoid unnecessarily generic TLDs, like .COMPANY, .COUNTRY, and .WEBSITE. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a set rule though—as the .COM namespace gets more crowded, people will have to gravitate &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. My guess is that they&amp;rsquo;ll gravitate towards the more specific options, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you register a domain, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend doing a little search to see if the TLD you&amp;rsquo;re looking at is appearing on email block lists (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://vamsoft.com/forum/topic/597/existing-list-of-garbage-new-tlds&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; I found while searching for &amp;ldquo;which tlds are spam indicators&amp;rdquo;). If you start noticing trends, that could be a bad sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Local ccTLDs and gTLDs can be good for business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-23-restaurant.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;restaurant&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By design, the internet is a global marketplace. No matter where your website is being hosted, anyone in the world can check out what you&amp;rsquo;re offering. But in many instances, people and businesses don&amp;rsquo;t need a global reach. Restaurants, regional banks, local politicians—these people and places are focused locally, and can often benefit from local TLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/cctlds&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what Moz has to say:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important in international SEO, ccTLDs are the single strongest way to show search engines and users where the site originates. This means that, all things being equal, example.fr will likely rank better in a French user&amp;rsquo;s SERP than example.us or example.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Google Webmaster Tools will not let you geotarget a ccTLD because it is, by definition, already geotargeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worrying about SEO might be a few steps beyond where your mind is, but thinking about where you&amp;rsquo;ll appear in search results early is the best way to make sure you&amp;rsquo;ll rank well later on. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it in human terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have a restaurant named MUCH MEAT (all caps for emphasis) in Canada, but somewhere in the US there&amp;rsquo;s a slightly more popular restaurant with a very similar name using the .COM. Because of their popularity, their domain name would likely show up before yours in search results&amp;hellip;&lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re using the .CA ccTLD, which would give you a slight advantage when people are searching for you in Canada (&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/62399&#34;&gt;although you can target generic TLDs like .COM to specific places, too&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s just an extra step). Basically, if you&amp;rsquo;re not an international company, your local ccTLD is a wonderful option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&amp;hellip;Unless you live in the US. If you travel to just about any country on the planet, you&amp;rsquo;ll see tons of signs with ccTLDs. In Wellington, signs with .NZ and .CO.NZ might outnumber .COMs—but in the US, people don&amp;rsquo;t use .US at all. It&amp;rsquo;s just one of those quirks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other advantage to using your local ccTLD is that the namespace is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; less crowded than .COM. &lt;a href=&#34;http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/top_level_domain/all&#34;&gt;This chart&lt;/a&gt; shows 50.8% of all websites use .COM, while most other TLDs account for less than 0.1%. That&amp;rsquo;s a big popularity gap, which likely means prime names are still up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the name you want &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; taken in your local ccTLD namespace, there are a bunch of new TLDs coming out for specific cities. .BERLIN, .PARIS, .LONDON, .NYC—all are currently available, and their relative newness likely means you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find the domain you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. Plus, if you&amp;rsquo;re only targeting people from the city you&amp;rsquo;re in, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a nice potential SEO bump for being hyperlocal (although Google is currently treating city extensions as standard gTLDs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When going local goes wrong&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few instances where trying to go local doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually mean the internet thinks you&amp;rsquo;re local. Here are a few hypotheticals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The common initials for the state of Delaware are DE, but .DE is the ccTLD for Germany. Your customers might think it&amp;rsquo;s cool, but Google&amp;rsquo;s never going to geotarget you correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like Delaware, Sussex in England uses SX as their abbreviation, but .SX is the ccTLD for Sint Maarten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best rule to follow is to know what your TLD stands for before you register it (if it&amp;rsquo;s a ccTLD that Google considers generic, you&amp;rsquo;re fine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;.IO and the TLDs for tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-23-tech.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tech&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-domain-hacks.html&#34;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt;. As .COM got more and more crowded, the rapidly growing startup scene had to go somewhere, but the where wasn&amp;rsquo;t so obvious—until the ever-so-creative founders started blending their company names and their domain names together. So started a trend where every new startup ended with &amp;ldquo;ly&amp;rdquo; while using the .LY ccTLD (here&amp;rsquo;s a great Pinterest board, aptly named &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;Names That End in -ly&#34;&gt;Names That End in -ly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way though, startups started moving to .IO en masse (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a great list of .IO domains in the wild&lt;/a&gt;, and another list of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/&#34;&gt;1457 most popular .IO domains in existence&lt;/a&gt;). It had a lot going for it—I/O commonly stands for Input/Output, Io is a pretty awesome moon and is big in Greek mythology, and it makes for a pretty nice domain hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also going for .IO was the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s on the list of ccTLDs Google treats as gTLDs because they&amp;rsquo;re so commonly used (g stands for generic). &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1347922?hl=en&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the list:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.ad, .as, .bz, .cc, .cd, .co, .dj, .fm, .io, .la, .me, .ms, .nu, .sc, .sr, .su, .tv, .tk, .ws, .eu, .asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with all the new gTLDs available today, startups and tech sites have more options than ever. .SOFTWARE, .TECHNOLOGY, .DIGITAL, .CODES, .CONSULTING, .BUILD—the list goes on and on and on. And my guess is that, like the rise of .LY and .IO, it&amp;rsquo;s only going to take a few big startups to start using the new gTLDs to get the whole train moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;Are some TLDs better for reaching an international audience?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the process of starting a new website and want to go with a shorter domain extension than any of the new gTLDs (or .COM), there are a few nice options. As stated above, Google treats .ad, .as, .bz, .cc, .cd, .co, .dj, .fm, .io, .la, .me, .ms, .nu, .sc, .sr, .su, .tv, .tk, .ws, and .eu as generic, meaning you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1347922?hl=en&#34;&gt;set a geographic target through Google Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. use a .co domain and be listed in search results in the United States, Canada or France although it is actually Colombia’s top-level domain. The same is true if you don’t want to target a specific country, i.e. have a .me domain for your personal online profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But which ones of these so-called gccTLDs (generic country code top-level domains) are the most popular and more likely to be recognized by visitors?Let’s take a look at Verisign’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/domain-name-report-march2015.pdf&#34;&gt;latest domain industry brief&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-21-gcctld-chart.png&#34; alt=&#34;verisign graph&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ccTLDs, including .tk, .co, .me and .tv are frequently used by registrants and treated by search engines as gTLDs. This chart ranks the zone size of both gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs, as of Dec. 31, 2014, with that classification taken into account. The top 10 largest gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs by zone size were .com, .tk, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .co, .mobi, .me and .tv, as of Dec. 31, 2014, which account for 180.6 million domain name registrations, or 62.8 percent of the total global domain name registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau&#34;&gt;.TK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&#34;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&#34;&gt;.TV&lt;/a&gt; as the most popular gccTLDs in that list. Not surprising, except .TK, which offers free domains—but with certain usage restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other popular ones you may have seen are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&#34;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; for tech sites (which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/&#34;&gt;still on the rise&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&#34;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt; for music websites, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands&#34;&gt;.CC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa&#34;&gt;.WS&lt;/a&gt; for general use, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nu-domain-name-registration-for-niue&#34;&gt;.NU&lt;/a&gt; (popular in Scandinavian countries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesser known gccTLDs, but often registered for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&#34;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; because they don’t require any special documentation or local address in the country, are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&#34;&gt;.LA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&#34;&gt;.MS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&#34;&gt;.SC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/as-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-american-samoa&#34;&gt;.AS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize&#34;&gt;.BZ&lt;/a&gt; suffixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the remaining geo-targetable domain extensions from Google’s list: .AD, .CD, .DJ, .SR, and .SU. Unfortunately, we don&amp;rsquo;t carry these domains because they&amp;rsquo;re not easy to purchase and maintain, so you&amp;rsquo;d have to choose another registrar (our friends at &lt;a href=&#34;https://domainr.com&#34;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help with that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;Is it ok to use a new gTLD?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-23-pizza-menu.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pizza menu&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest question of the day. As I stated at the beginning of this post, for many people, .COM &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the internet, and that&amp;rsquo;s a hard nut to crack. So when the new gTLDs launched, many thought the assumed SEO bump would kickstart the system. But not so fast. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short post from &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+MattCutts/posts/4VaWg4TMM5F&#34;&gt;Matt Cutts:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a post by someone offering new top-level domain (TLDs). They made this claim: &amp;ldquo;Will a new TLD web address automatically be favoured by Google over a .com equivalent? Quite simply, yes it will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but that&amp;rsquo;s just not true, and as an engineer in the search quality team at Google, I feel the need to debunk this misconception. Google has a lot of experience in returning relevant web pages, regardless of the top-level domain (TLD). Google will attempt to rank new TLDs appropriately, but I don&amp;rsquo;t expect a new TLD to get any kind of initial preference over .com, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bet on that happening in the long-term either. If you want to register an entirely new TLD for other reasons, that&amp;rsquo;s your choice, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t register a TLD in the mistaken belief that you&amp;rsquo;ll get some sort of boost in search engine rankings.﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And if that&amp;rsquo;s not enough, &lt;a href=&#34;http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.fr/2015/07/googles-handling-of-new-top-level.html&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s another, more recent, Google comment on the subject.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So aside from being potentially confusing and not providing any sort of built-in SEO advantage, the reason I (and others) like the new gTLDs so much is because they &lt;em&gt;just make sense&lt;/em&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s a good bit by &lt;a href=&#34;http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2015/06/14/how-to-name-your-startup/&#34;&gt;Karn Jajoo for The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new TLD is often just a natural fit: take the example of ‘Lily’, the world’s first self-flying camera drone. ‘Lily’ could refer to the flowering plant, a common first name, or a small town, and its .com is registered by Lily Transportation Corp. Therefore, the Menlo Park robotics startup behind this drone used a simple, elegant domain to disambiguate its product – lily.camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of the case of Nissan computer vs. Nissan motors? Uzi Nissan, a reseller of computer hardware and peripherals, registered Nissan.com on June 4, 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years later, the Nissan Motor Corporation (which was called Datsun in the late 1970s) filed a $10 million lawsuit against Nissan Computer claiming cyber-squatting, trademark infringement and trademark dilution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if new TLDs had existed back then, Nissan.computer and Nissan.auto would have solved this contention without the lengthy legal dispute that has allegedly already cost Mr. Uzi $2.2 million in legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing endless new namespaces for people to register short, memorable domain names, the new gTLDs act as a natural category structure for the web. In a perfect world where people like myself didn&amp;rsquo;t register .PIZZA domains for everything, you could theoretically know what the site you&amp;rsquo;re about to click on is all about, just from its TLD. And that&amp;rsquo;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-7&#34;&gt;Does your TLD really matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-23-telescope.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;discovery&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Pando Daily, in an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://pando.com/2014/10/09/whats-in-a-name-the-fading-tyranny-of-dot-com/&#34;&gt;“What’s In A Name? The fading tyranny of dot com”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone like Michael Heyward, who co-founded anonymous social networking app Whisper in 2012, as a mobile first company, he says, there was not an ounce of trepidation at not having the Whisper.com domain name. (Whisper.com itself is a junk address, filled with spam links.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heyward says that 99 percent of Whisper’s exposure comes from its app. The company has a Whisper.sh landing page, to showcase popular posts from the app and publish legal and company information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Americans spend more time in apps than they do using the Internet on desktop. With social media sites becoming a greater engine for content discovery, new sites such as Quartz are popping up that don’t really even have an official homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about that. For the foreseeable future, we&amp;rsquo;ll all need domain names to run our platforms and blogs, but discovery is changing &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. Really fast. On a given day, almost all the content I personally read online comes from links on content aggregators like Techmeme and Hacker News, or social platforms like Facebook and Twitter. And because I trust the sources I&amp;rsquo;m finding sites and articles with, the domain itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It could be &amp;ldquo;ten words long dot anything&amp;rdquo; and I likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting on my future hat, my advice would be to find the TLD that &lt;em&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re&lt;/em&gt; most comfortable with and go with it. .COM, .IO, .LIMO—no matter what it is, if you commit to it, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>The guide to creating professional online stores</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a product to sell and an ounce of sticktoitiveness, the barrier for entry into the world of online sales is smaller than ever. Just pick a platform, select and tweak a template, take some product shots, and you’re up and running. But don&amp;rsquo;t let the bevy of simplified platforms make you lazy, there are plenty of decisions you still need to make to stand out from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go through, step-by-step, the important things you need to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Does my domain name matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;A few brand naming exercises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;What are some domain name best practices?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Which e-commerce platform is right for me?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to think about stock images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Does my domain name matter?&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Company naming is one of the hardest things anyone creating a website will have to do. Not because naming things is inherently hard (there really isn&amp;rsquo;t a wrong choice), but because the name is the single hardest thing to change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think about it. In 10 years, assuming your new shopping site becomes a success, your website will probably change once or twice (or more), your logo might go through countless small tweaks and revisions, and your brand tone could be completely reworked, but your name sticks. It&amp;rsquo;s on the tips of your customers&amp;rsquo; tongues; it&amp;rsquo;s on all your social handles, your email addresses, your documentation. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to change a name (but it can be done).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to your name, the internet adds a second layer of naming difficulty—the TLD (the part after the dot, like COM in .COM). The most popular TLD today is .COM, but finding a good, memorable name in the .COM namespace can be like finding a needle in a haystack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, many brands are looking outside the .COM sphere. Local ccTLDs (like New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s .NZ and Canada&amp;rsquo;s .CA) are good for local businesses, but not so good for international shopping. &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1347922?hl=en&#34;&gt;Some ccTLDs are thought of as generic now&lt;/a&gt;, though, like .IO, which stands for Indian Ocean Territories, but is now a trendy .COM alternative used by tech startups. .CO, for Columbia, is another very popular ccTLD being used by businesses all over the world. Then again, there are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; like .SITE, .CLUB, and .FASHION that are very specific to certain industries and ideas, but are still unknown to much of the public (new can be good, but may lead to some confusion depending on the audience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of articles on the web about the plusses and minuses of using the new gTLDs, but here&amp;rsquo;s a good one from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150115_branding_with_new_gtlds_the_next_marketing_frontier&#34;&gt;Annalisa Roger, CircleID:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&amp;rsquo;s largest advertising agencies and the most cutting edge businesses, as well as the world&amp;rsquo;s leading brands, serve their customers by locating themselves in the minds of people with informative descriptors. Marketing with photos and taglines is effective, but being able to also do this with diverse new Top Level Domain name extensions is new. Staking out new Internet property with a new gTLD is akin to joining a community, an industry market sector, or a geographically or otherwise focused audience for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For new gTLDs that designate a community, the benefits to registrants are compounded. Community TLDs bring added values. Trust and loyalty come into play when brands align with the beliefs and goals of a targeted audience. Not all new gTLDs represent communities however, but those that do can offer brands a unique value proposition. The opportunity to co-brand with a community, provided the content is relevant, can lead to the valuable position of becoming a recognized member of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;A few brand naming exercises&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Before we get too deep into which domain name you should choose, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure you have a brand name that will stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best tip for starting the naming process is to come up with as many options as you possibly can. It can be a grind, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find names along the way you feel you can end the process with, but keep going. Professional naming companies come up with hundreds, even thousands, of names before they deliver the final selections to their clients. Just remember that options will provide inspiration for more options, and the process is what will give you the confidence to stick with your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first, set a goal. Say, by the end of the process, you want to have 500 naming options (it&amp;rsquo;ll take time, but long term solutions rarely get conjured up in a day). Instead of just coming up with 500 random names though, your best strategy will be dividing your effort into chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your goal is 500 naming options, here&amp;rsquo;s process you could follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down 100 common words that pertain to your brand (real words can be brand names!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From those 100 words, try combining some of them to get 100 more words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, get a little weird and invent 100 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a Latin dictionary and come up with 100 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try combining the Latin words with some of your words above to get your final 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From that list, come up with your top 10, then start looking for available domain names (if you&amp;rsquo;re aiming for a .COM, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance some of your options will already be taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no rules to naming, so whatever your process is, as long as you stick with it, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely come up with something original and new. There are some things you should try to avoid though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get caught up in trends. Brands that start with lowercase e&amp;rsquo;s and i&amp;rsquo;s and end in ly&amp;rsquo;s are always going to be seen as names from a very specific era. Shoot for timelessness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spelling is hard enough. Adding additional vowels to normal words for the sake of originality can be pretty tricky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid excessively long names unless you want to be the brand that ironically has an excessively long name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad mouth shapes can be unexpectedly damaging. Some words, no matter who says them, force people into frowns and strange guttural noises. Be sure to pronounce your name a number of times before making a final decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do, avoid bad connotations. If, hidden in your brand name, you accidentally sound out a hate group or a traditionally bad word, you have a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;What are some domain name best practices?&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have some brand names in mind, it&amp;rsquo;s time to find your domain name. Instead of re-creating the wheel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain&#34;&gt;Moz has a great guide&lt;/a&gt; to domain name SEO Best Practices. Here are their top tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word Separators &amp;ndash; Avoid hyphens. Hyphens detract from credibility and can act as a spam indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-Level Domain (TLD) &amp;ndash; Top-level domains (like .com) are the extensions associated with domain names. For best ranking results, avoid uncommon top-level domains (TLDs). Like hyphens, TLDs such as .info, .cc, .ws, and .name are spam indicators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length &amp;ndash; Avoid domain names longer than 15 characters. Short domain names are easier to remember, easier to share, and have a smaller chance of resulting in typos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best practice of all though (you should see this coming) is to get your domain name &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;right here at iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;. High five!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Which e-commerce platform is right for me?&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;With your domain name now set, your final big decision is to pick an platform to build your site on. There are a ton out there, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/&#34;&gt;our Marketplace has 12 of the most popular platforms&lt;/a&gt; available, and they can be added to your iwantmyname domain with just a few clicks (no confusing DNS setups FTW!). Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/big-cartel-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Big Cartel&lt;/a&gt;: Big Cartel is one of the biggest e-commerce platforms on the web, primarily focusing on designers, artists, bands and other creative folks. Most notably, Big Cartel has some great templates you can tweak (no code needed, but you can use your own CSS/HTML if you want), and a host of analytics tools to track your activity and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;: As far as customizability goes, Squarespace is one of the most intuitive platforms on the web. With its simple “Layout Engine” editing interface, you can make your sites, blogs and stores look just how you want them to, and with an impressive list of third-party integrations, your shops can be more flexible than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&#34;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;: Like the storefronts of yesteryear, the best way to catch a customer&amp;rsquo;s eye is to look clean and fresh. And with more than 100 themes in the Theme Store (including plenty of great responsive options), you should be covered here. Tack on a full-featured CMS, tons of third-party integrations and advanced marketing tools and you have yourself quite a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/tictail-store-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Tictail&lt;/a&gt;: While Tictail may not have the full site capabilities of a platform like Squarespace (although it isn’t that far off), it may just be the easiest platform for setting up a store. It’s so easy in fact, that you can sign up with your Facebook and Twitter account, pick a template (CSS and HTML customization is available), set some basic information up in the dashboard, and launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/bigcommerce&#34;&gt;BigCommerce&lt;/a&gt;: Bigcommerce is an impressive platform for a number of reasons, but mainly because of the number of tools it gives you to succeed. Aside from having an easy to use site creator, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a host of marketing tools, reporting and analytics panels, and integrations—the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/customize-flyingcart-with-your-own-domain&#34;&gt;Flying Cart&lt;/a&gt;: Big stores, small stores—Flying Cart can handle them all with workmanlike efficiency. Take control of your code or use a template, then use a mass of backend tools and services, like social integration, inventory tracking and custom domain usage to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/simple-goodsie-custom-domain-setup&#34;&gt;Goodsie&lt;/a&gt;: Like Big Cartel and a few of the other platforms on the list, Goodsie is a platform designed for small-to-medium sized stores. But unlike some of the others, Goodsie makes design customizations incredibly easy with a visual CSS interface. And with a number of polished themes to make your own, it’s a great platform for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/jimdo-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Jimdo&lt;/a&gt;: 10 million sites created. Easy store creation. A well-made iOS app for mobile access. There’s a lot to like about Jimdo, the Hamburg-based platform created for simple site building in 2007, but perhaps the nicest feature is the ability to create and launch a bare-bones store for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/buy-own-domain-lightcms&#34;&gt;LightCMS&lt;/a&gt;: Unlike most platforms with big (often bloated) content management tools, LightCMS gives you the freedom to edit content directly on your site. And with a host of built-in e-commerce tools, there might not be an easier platform to use for your shopping site needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/selz&#34;&gt;Selz&lt;/a&gt;: Selz sells itself on being &amp;ldquo;incredibly simple for you to sell what you do and get paid.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use, is constantly being updated (beautiful themes are regularly added to the mix), and only charges per transaction, meaning there&amp;rsquo;s no monthly/annual site fee to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/storenvy-custom-domain-registration&#34;&gt;Storenvy&lt;/a&gt;: Storenvy thrives on providing a large Etsy-like storefront for all its sites to feature their wares. But don’t fret, Storenvy also lets you set up your own site, complete with custom CSS/HTML (or templates), easy inventory tracking, and up to 500 products for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/supadupa-custom-domain&#34;&gt;SupaDupa&lt;/a&gt;: Geared primarily towards clothing designers, SupaDupa offers more than 45 professionally designed themes, and all the stability and security you’d want with a professional store. And there’s something refreshingly honest about SupaDupa’s mission statement, “We didn’t set out to build something for everyone, our job is not to appeal to the most people, it’s to create a place for the people who care about the things we care about, like beauty, truth and making things to love, with love.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt;: Instead of giving you the built-in tools needed to set up your own store, Virb teamed up with Big Cartel and Etsy to allow for easy store/product imports. And given Virb’s do-it-all functionality, we’d recommend giving them a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox of choice struggle is real. In all reality, there&amp;rsquo;s probably not a wrong answer when choosing a platform—but some will definitely be better for you than others. When browsing the individual sites for these platforms, the biggest things to look for are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;price (don&amp;rsquo;t forget to figure in transaction fees)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;style (make sure it looks good on mobile as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease-of-use (free trials are your friend)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trajectory (pick a platform that&amp;rsquo;s thriving&amp;hellip; ideally the one you choose will grow with you throughout your brand&amp;rsquo;s existence)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;features (things like shipping tools, inventory trackers, and reporting systems will save you a lot of time as you grow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;It&#39;s time to think about stock images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-02-18-corporate-terrible.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;corporate high five&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re selling shoes online, do yourself a favor and get some real product shots of your own goods. But if your store is selling a service, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to need some stock images to set the mood. To get the good stuff though, you have to do it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that dragging images from the web and dropping them into your posts is technically feasible, but without proper attributions and licensing, you&amp;rsquo;re playing on the wrong side of the field. I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you the legalese here. It comes down to this—people work really hard to produce quality photography and graphics. So please, don&amp;rsquo;t steal it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, here are some tips to keep you out of moral grey areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paid stock photography doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to suck. Sure, there are thousands of terrible photos of corporate teams high fiving (see above), but sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shutterstock.com/&#34;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigstockphoto.com/&#34;&gt;Bigstock&lt;/a&gt; are filled with millions of great images, vectors and videos, with more added every day. Again, just don&amp;rsquo;t (EVER) use the corporate high five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Getty Images dumped 35 million images into a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gettyimages.com/creative-images/royaltyfree&#34;&gt;royalty free section&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s free images from arguably the biggest image collection on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also find free stock photos. Good ones. Here&amp;rsquo;s a great list by Dustin Senos of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/p/62ae4bcbe01b&#34;&gt;best free stock photo sites&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;rsquo;s found (and it looks like he&amp;rsquo;s updating it as he finds more).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/&#34;&gt;Flickr Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome tool. Basically, users from all over the world upload photos for public use under the Creative Commons License. Just be sure to follow the rules. And no, adding a little &amp;ldquo;image from&amp;rdquo; blurb at the bottom of a post isn&amp;rsquo;t bothersome to readers at all. It just shows you care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything is possible if you ask nicely. If you see an image you love online, you can always ask the site owner if you can use it yourself. Yes, they have the right to say no (or not respond at all), but it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>The guide to getting your own custom email address</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-07-10-custom-email.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Custom Email&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom email may seem like a small detail in the larger branding picture, but it&amp;rsquo;s hugely important. In a single glance, this is what it means to your customers, clients, and/or acquaintances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom email address = you&amp;rsquo;ve created a real business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your old gmail.com or yahoo.com email address = this is your weekend hobby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s patch up your branding right now and set you on the path to legitimacy. It&amp;rsquo;s an inexpensive (sometimes free) bit of branding that will make a world of difference for your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;The basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Custom email options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Email forwarding?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t you get a free custom address with Google Apps?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t you get a free custom address with Microsoft?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;What should go before the @?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;The basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a custom email address, think of it the same way you would when creating a new website. First, pick an email platform to use, then install it to your custom domain. For example, if “The Dude”—fictional owner of &lt;strong&gt;theinternet.io&lt;/strong&gt;—wanted to set up a custom email address, he would search through the email hosts in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, then pick the one that suits him best. Each of them will allow him to email from thedude@&lt;strong&gt;theinternet.io&lt;/strong&gt;, but each will also provide a slightly different set of features, a different webmail client, and a wide range of prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Custom email options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have four custom email platform options in our Marketplace, all providing stable service and excellent customer support. Check each platform for updated prices (usually priced per user/mailbox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite&#34;&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt;: For many users, Zoho Mail is a top choice because it’s free for up to 25 mailboxes. &lt;em&gt;Free!&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to install, has a clean interface, delivers push mail and two-way sync, and never displays weird ads on your page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain&#34;&gt;Google Apps&lt;/a&gt;: Google Apps is likely the most common email host people are using these days—and for good reason. With Google Apps, you get the exact same email interface and benefits you get with a personal Gmail account, but with the added organizational benefits of Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Sites, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain&#34;&gt;Fastmail.fm&lt;/a&gt;: Created by Opera Software—the company behind the Opera browser—Fastmail.fm is growing fast because of its dedication to reliability and security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/rackspace-apps&#34;&gt;Rackspace Email&lt;/a&gt;: While Rackspace Email doesn’t provide all the bells and whistles of a platform like Google Apps, it does have one very nice feature—hosted Microsoft Exchange. For non-Exchange users, Rackspace also provides a nice webmail platform, 24x7 support, and multiple layers of spam and virus protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Email forwarding?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike providers like Zoho Mail and Fastmail, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding&#34;&gt;Pobox&lt;/a&gt; specializes in email forwarding. So instead of attaching your email address to a service with a webmail system you’re not used to, Pobox lets you forward your new unique email address to an email platform (and address) you commonly use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the basic pitch, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pobox.com/faq/&#34;&gt;pobox.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email forwarding makes it possible for you to separate where you read your email from your email identity. Forwarding takes mail sent to one address, and redirects it to another, without the sender having to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your email address, your identity, is how you keep in touch, what you use to access many websites&amp;hellip; indeed, it&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;re known. Email forwarding lets you easily change where you read your mail, without getting a new address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It breaks the tie between your mailbox and your address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your email provider introduces a new policy you dislike, you can move. If your ISP changes its name, your email address is unaffected. If a new service starts up that you&amp;rsquo;d love to try, you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in email forwarding, we thoroughly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://konklone.com/post/take-control-of-your-email-address&#34;&gt;this guide from Eric Mill&lt;/a&gt; (it even goes through the iwantmyname installation process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Can&#39;t you get a free custom address with Google Apps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, Google Apps had a free tier that allowed people to set up free custom email addresses for up to ten users. It was awesome. But near the end of 2012, Google shut their free service down, forcing people to look for paid (gasp!) alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there may still be a way to do it (if this workaround doesn&amp;rsquo;t work anymore, let us know and we&amp;rsquo;ll take it down). &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplyian.com/2015/01/07/Hacking-GMail-to-use-custom-domains-for-free/&#34;&gt;From Ian Macalinao:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much common knowledge that Gmail is awesome. It’s fast, connects seamlessly with the rest of your Google services such as Drive, has a cool app called Inbox, and is overall an extremely powerful email service. However, to use it with a custom domain, you need to purchase Google Apps for either $5 or $10/month, which for casual users is a bit unnecessary. On top of that, you don’t even get all of the features a personal account gets, e.g. Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a free way to use your Gmail account with a custom domain: Mailgun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only works for up to 10,000 emails a month (which seems like a lot) and is definitely developer-centric, but&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;Can&#39;t you get a free custom address with Microsoft?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the free custom email deal with Google Apps, Microsoft used to offer a service that allowed users to attach their custom domains to free Hotmail and Outlook.com accounts. But in 2014, they shut it down to focus on their paid offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-ends-support-for-custom-domains-in-free-email-service/&#34;&gt;From Ed Bott, ZDNet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is disappointing, but not surprising. The fact that the Windows Live Admin Center continued to use the old Windows Live branding and was never updated with the modern design of Outlook.com was probably the biggest clue. In addition, the service has always been extremely limited, with administrators only able to add or delete addresses. And the relatively recent addition of a prominent Microsoft Office 365 link under the Sign In button was telling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for free custom email today, your only option is Zoho Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;What should go before the @??&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get your custom email address set up, your next task is to create individual email addresses (the part before the @). Fortunately (or unfortunately, if you&amp;rsquo;re bad at making decisions), the possibilities are endless. You can use your first name, your last name, some combination of the two, generic words like &amp;ldquo;owner&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;support&amp;rdquo;, nicknames like &amp;ldquo;bossman&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lordofemail&amp;rdquo;, or any other name you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before you start, take a minute to think about the future. First, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to make specific email accounts for individual people. Here are two potential landmines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;firstname@&lt;/strong&gt;: You&amp;rsquo;ve started your brand, now you want your email to be personable, yet professional. So you go with amy@yourbrand.com. When your brand is small, it&amp;rsquo;s fine, but what happens when you hire another Amy? Does that Amy get an email address using her last name (which would break your naming consistency)? Her initials?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lastname@&lt;/strong&gt;: Same issue as firstname@.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be safe, go with something like firstnamelastname@, firstname.lastname@, firstnamelastinitial@, or firstinitiallastname@. Sure, there will always be exceptions to the rule (if two people have the exact same name, maybe you can force them into a Hunger Games-type situation), but doing what you can to avoid future duplication will make your life much easier later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everyone has an individual account, be sure to create some general accounts for different roles. For example, it&amp;rsquo;s better to create a press@ account than to just have that email go to a specific person (what happens if that person leaves or takes on a new role within the company?). Don&amp;rsquo;t go overboard though—having too many email accounts can get confusing for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting the right logo for your website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands upon thousands of websites are created every day. New brands. New blogs. Social platforms, online portfolios, e-commerce sites. And really, there&amp;rsquo;s very little in common amongst the sites. Some will be responsive, some will have traditional layouts, some will have non-traditional layouts—but nearly all of them will have a logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo. It&amp;rsquo;s the first thing people see when they visit your site, but it&amp;rsquo;s often the last thing people think about when starting out. So let&amp;rsquo;s unlock some of the mystery behind the logo building process and figure out how you can get a logo you&amp;rsquo;ll be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Why a logo is important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/26/vital-tips-for-effective-logo-design/&#34;&gt;From Jacob Cass, Smashing Magazine: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what a logo is, we first must understand what the main purpose of logos is. The design process must aim to make the logo immediately recognizable, inspiring trust, admiration, loyalty and an implied superiority. The logo is one aspect of a company’s commercial brand or economic entity, and its shapes, colors, fonts, and images usually are strikingly different from other logo in the same market niche. Logos are used to identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Rand, one of the world’s greatest designers states that “a logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. A logo does not sell (directly), it identifies. A logo is rarely a description of a business. A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack that a bit. The logo, as stated above, is your brand&amp;rsquo;s signature. That brand could be you and your personal thoughts (a personal blog), a collection of many thoughts (a company website or group blog), or just a digital space for your physical entity (like a menu/information site for a restaurant)—no matter what it is, it&amp;rsquo;s your logo that will be front and center on your site (or maybe in the top left). And as Paul Rand says, your logo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a description of your business—it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to tell an epic at first glance—but it should give some meaning to what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. Does your logo &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671067/the-story-behind-the-famous-fedex-logo-and-why-it-works&#34;&gt;inspire motion&lt;/a&gt;? Whimsy? A rigid but formidable structure? Or the worst, a trend that died off years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things matter. Maybe not as much as the quality of whatever you&amp;rsquo;re building, but people do notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;How a logo fits into your branding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a logo matters most is when it comes to branding, and branding is &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; these days. Just think about it—instead of just seeing logos on physical goods and locations, then on the occasional website, you now see logos on Twitter handles, Facebook posts, Instagram shots, app icons, and emails. Branding is all over the internet, and if your logo doesn&amp;rsquo;t look good in any space, on any size, your brand is probably missing the mark (and giving your discerning customers a bad taste in their mouths).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little nugget from someone who was consistently ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xb8idEf-Iak&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while a company has a logo that&amp;rsquo;s a little jewel, a symbol, that can be used independently of the logotype. At Apple we had such a symbol, as a matter of fact, at Apple, the symbol was the name of the company. It was a thing that had the same name as the company—an apple. Our challenge was that it usually takes ten years and a hundred million dollars to associate a symbol with the name of the company. Our challenge was, how can we have a little jewel that we could use without the name to put on the product without spending ten years and a hundred million dollars to make that association in a customer&amp;rsquo;s mind. And Paul solved that by making a little jewel that contained in it the name of the company. And I think he really approached it as a problem that needed to be solved, rather than an artistic challenge for his own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, that little jewel is so critical—it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to fit in your square Twitter profile pic. It&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to fit cleanly on a mobile site without hogging too much screen real estate. And if you happen to see that logo in the wild, it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to give your potential customers an instant reminder of what you&amp;rsquo;re all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/what-makes-the-best-logos-so-good-2014-4&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit from Richard Feloni of Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; on how logos are changing because people are just now realizing the need for adaptability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tackling a branding project, Mathews differentiates between the &amp;ldquo;true and new.&amp;rdquo; She says a logo needs to be &amp;ldquo;true,&amp;rdquo; in the sense that it should not be fundamentally tied to a trend, the &amp;ldquo;new.&amp;rdquo; The trendiness is more appropriate in supporting elements of branding, like store experiences or website interfaces. That said, a logo should be fundamentally sound but also be adaptable to the ways it will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Logos used to have to be recognizable down to the size that they would be represented on a business card. Now they have to work at much smaller sizes, because they&amp;rsquo;ll be seen on mobile screens,&amp;rdquo; Mathews said. That&amp;rsquo;s actually the reason why so many logos have become &amp;ldquo;flatter,&amp;rdquo; in the sense that they&amp;rsquo;ve been stripped of techniques like shadowing that add a dimension of depth or movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;What it takes to design a logo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that adaptability in mind, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know what it takes to create a logo that works. Aaron Draplin, one of the most well-known logo designers today, made a great video on his process, and a bit of the thinking that goes behind logo creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&#34;embed-responsive-item&#34; src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/113751583?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to design that logo, and just have it floating on this PDF, and you&amp;rsquo;re sort of drunk on white space and negative space and just floating, but rarely will you see it that way. The way you see it will be on some stupid little Instagram in the corner, or on a guy&amp;rsquo;s business card, or embroidered on his sweatshirt or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a rush job from one of the better designers out there, but if you want a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; logo, it&amp;rsquo;s probably going to take a bit of time, some honest critical thinking, and possibly a bit of money. (In short, you should be wary of any company offering you a quick logo for cheap. You might end up getting something wonderful, but most likely you&amp;rsquo;re going to get something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture the soul of your brand, and will probably look dated in a couple of years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Logo options for different budgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and effort aside, does it cost thousands, or millions, of dollars to get a good logo? Nope. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/4140/the-cost-of-a-logo&#34;&gt;From HUH., in an article titled &amp;ldquo;The Cost Of A Logo&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, oil giant BP commissioned creative agency Landor Associates, advertising agency Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather and the PR consultants Ogilvy PR to replace their &amp;ldquo;Green Shield&amp;rdquo; logo with the current Helios symbol and create a surrounding identity and campaign. Designed in a green and yellow sunflower pattern, the logo represents energy in its many forms and comes with the tagline &amp;ldquo;Beyond Petroleum&amp;rdquo;. The cost of this re-branding procedure? A mere $211 million USD…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, Google went a different route:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite arguably being the most recognisable logo in the Western world, the Google logo cost the Internet company exactly $0 to create. It was actually designed in 1998 by co-founder Sergey Brin and, although it&amp;rsquo;s obviously been tuned up a little since then, the main elements still remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good logos can come from anywhere, and can be made by anyone. Expectations are important though. While Google did indeed create an iconic logo on the cheap, the company started in the early days of the internet when sites typically looked terrible. User expectations of website designs were initially quite low, and the Google logo has been polished, repolished, and probably repolished again between then and now to make up for it. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to go the route of creating your own logo or going with something inexpensive, don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck. Your brand is always evolving, and your logo can, and should, evolve with it (unless you strike gold with a cheap logo like Nike or Coca-Cola).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few directions you could go when looking to get a logo built:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some design skills? Pull up Adobe Illustrator, or your app of choice, and start creating. (You can also use free tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://squarespace.com/logo&#34;&gt;Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s logo creator&lt;/a&gt;, but know that your options will be limited.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know a designer? Figure out a budget and ask if they&amp;rsquo;ll help you out. (A budget is important, even if it&amp;rsquo;s small&amp;hellip; if you value someone&amp;rsquo;s work, you should pay them.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try a site like &lt;a href=&#34;http://99designs.com&#34;&gt;99designs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design/creative-logo-design/#layout=auto&amp;amp;page=1&#34;&gt;Fiverr&lt;/a&gt;. If anything, getting an inexpensive logo made will set you on the right track, giving you something you can evolve as your brand does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a local branding shop. Anyone good will charge $100+/hr (rough estimate), but with a branding shop, you&amp;rsquo;ll get someone who will give your brand some real attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you get, there is one important thing to be mindful of. Be consistent. Sure, you can make changes to your logo over time, but you need to be consistent with it across the board. Your site logo needs to pair with your Twitter logo, and your font can&amp;rsquo;t be Helvetica in one place, and then Arial on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a designer&amp;rsquo;s worst nightmare, &lt;a href=&#34;http://logopsych.com/2013/01/13/small-business-logo-commitment/#more-60&#34;&gt;from Logo Psych:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew he probably didn’t have much of a budget to hire me (or anyone else) to design a logo from scratch so I did the best I could and offered him some free advice. I told him NOT to do what the previous owners of Dexter’s did. Dexter’s had a terrible brand consistency problem. Their front sign, side sign, business cards and website all displayed a different style of what might be called Dexter’s logo. Their card had a silhouette of a coffee mug with the handle turned into a Helvetica D with the rest of the word following in Helvetica. It wasn’t great, but not too terrible either. It could have been an effective logo if they’d just had a sense of COMMITMENT to that single logo. Their front signage had their name in something similar to Baskerville, a serifed “classic” typeface. The sign on the side of the building was something different, and their website logo I believe was set in Times New Roman. Absolutely no consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you go with, make sure you use your logo consistently. It matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;What to look for when choosing from options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;re going with someone like Paul Rand, who famously only provided a single logo option to his clients, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be presented with a few variations. How do you choose between them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32495854&#34;&gt;from Peter Shadbolt, BBC:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are presented with a design for your company logo that is immediately likeable and resonates with your values, you might be wise to take a long hard look at it, bin it, and start again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the opinion of Sagi Haviv, partner at New York graphic design firm Chermayeff &amp;amp; Geismer &amp;amp; Haviv (CGH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s never love at first sight,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;A good logo, a good trademark, gains meaning and power over time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you slide into melancholy, the key thing to know is that picking the right logo takes time. Just like when choosing a house, a car, or a pair of jeans, you have to put stock into all the options. You might love something immediately, but give every option some thought, and really try to see the value in everything you&amp;rsquo;re given. Subtlety can take time to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a thought-starter, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidairey.com/what-makes-a-good-logo/&#34;&gt;David Airey, on the important design elements of brand identities:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend Lee Newham taught me about five important design elements when it comes to brand identities. Iconic logos are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective without colour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable i.e. work when just an inch in size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant to the industry in question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most things in life, just know that there&amp;rsquo;s never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; going to be a perfect option. If you&amp;rsquo;re an observant human, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be able to find fault in anything. But as Paul Rand said at the beginning &amp;ldquo;a logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around.&amp;rdquo; A great logo won&amp;rsquo;t make a bad brand good, and a bad logo can always be made better, as long as the brand can prop it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be brave! Make a decision and stick with it (for a while at least)! And don&amp;rsquo;t stagnate. Stagnation is probably the worst thing for your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting started with iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this guide is to get you started on iwantmyname, assuming you have no background in domain registration or starting up a website. We&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep things as need-to-know as possible, so if you&amp;rsquo;re easily distracted, or just don&amp;rsquo;t like your intro guides seeming like college courses, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Registering your first domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Making sure your information is secure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Putting your domain name to work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Registering your first domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-city-houses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Crowded Houses&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When registering your first domain name, try to think of it as a house just waiting to be constructed. In your mind, you probably have a good idea what you want your house to look like, but first, you need to figure out where to put it. That&amp;rsquo;s where TLDs (top-level domain) come in. The TLD is the part of your domain name after the dot—COM is the TLD for iwantmyname.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this world of domain names, your name is the house, and the TLD, the part after the dot, is the city you want to build in. The most common TLD today is .COM, which a city unlike any other. It&amp;rsquo;s the most well known, which is great for memorability (and potentially, traffic), but it&amp;rsquo;s huge and crowded, so a lot of the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; (short/memorable) property was taken long ago. On the flip side, there are hundreds of other TLDs to choose from—you just need to find the best option that aligns with your brand or interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of all the types of TLDs we offer, broken into easy categories (or, just take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;all of them on a single page&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gTLDs (generic top-level domains) &amp;ndash; The basic definition of a gTLD is any domain extension that doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent a country or territory. .COM is a gTLD that stands for commercial. .NET stands for network. .ORG stands for organization. (Don&amp;rsquo;t get hung up on &amp;ldquo;original intent&amp;rdquo; though. You can use .NET, .ORG, .COM, or any of our other TLDs for any type of business you want you want.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;The new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (often called nTLDs, or new TLDs) &amp;ndash; Just recently, the internet was flooded with hundreds of new gTLDs (like .PIZZA, .DESIGN, and .PHOTOS) in an effort to alleviate some of the overcrowding issues .COM is having. So now, instead of calling your catering company YOURBRANDcatering.COM, you could go with YOURBRAND.CATERING.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) &amp;ndash; Unlike .COM, ccTLDs are assigned to countries. For example, New Zealand uses .NZ, Spain uses .ES, and Canada uses .CA. So if you&amp;rsquo;re running a restaurant in Belgium, you could use your local .BE ccTLD instead of the more global .COM, giving you a less crowded namespace to work with, and potentially a more local feel. You don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be from the country to use its ccTLD either (we&amp;rsquo;ll let you know if there are any weird registration quirks involved)—.CO and .IO (Columbia and Indian Ocean Territories, respectively) are so commonly used, they&amp;rsquo;re often considered gTLDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an idea of the name you want, head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; and type the domain into the big search box in the middle of the page (then hit enter, or click the big button).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a long list of your domain with every TLD we offer. If the one you want is available, just click on it and it&amp;rsquo;ll appear in your cart on the right side of the screen (if it&amp;rsquo;s not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-getting-the-right-domain-name-for-your-brand.html&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the guide&lt;/a&gt; on what to do next). If that&amp;rsquo;s the only domain you want, next, click the button labeled &lt;strong&gt;Checkout&lt;/strong&gt;—otherwise, feel free to search for and add other domains to your order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-shop-cart.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shopping Cart&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next page, create your iwantmyname login information using your email address and a password (we recommend using a tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; for password management), then click &lt;strong&gt;Continue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;re on the checkout page, which is far more important than you think. It&amp;rsquo;s all self-explanatory, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;super important&lt;/em&gt; to use accurate contact information. And yes, that means your real address, phone number, email address, etc. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-ins-and-outs-of-whois-privacy-and-accurate-contact-information.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a good article&lt;/a&gt; on why it&amp;rsquo;s necessary, and how you can protect your information the right way using WHOIS privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Making sure your information is secure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-account-page.png&#34; alt=&#34;Account page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have your first domain name now, but before you do anything else, let&amp;rsquo;s secure your information—just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little checklist of things we recommend doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make sure your password is strong&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time you&amp;rsquo;ve been told to create a strong password, but it&amp;rsquo;s always a good thing to hear (like eating your vegetables). Your password can be whatever you want, but our general suggestion is not to use anything that could easily be found through a simple internet search. So no family names, pet names, important dates, job titles, or hobbies you&amp;rsquo;ve written about. Randomness and length are key—we recommend using something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change your password, click &lt;strong&gt;Login &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Account&lt;/strong&gt; in the top navigation and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Use two-factor authentication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to be secure, we recommend using two-factor authentication (2FA). Our implementation through Authy forces you (or a potential hacker) to enter a randomly generated code after you enter your login information that is only viewable through the Authy app on your phone or laptop. The idea is that if your login information was compromised, the potential data thief would also have to have your phone (or computer, if you set it up that way) to complete the login process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add 2FA, click &lt;strong&gt;Login &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Account&lt;/strong&gt; in the top navigation. Note that we don&amp;rsquo;t have Google Authenticator implemented at this time, but we may add additional 2FA options in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Add WHOIS privacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHOIS privacy is a free service we offer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;all TLDs that support it&lt;/a&gt;. In short, ICANN (the entity that maintains the gTLD namespaces) and each entity running the ccTLDs have policies in place on what information needs to be made available to the public on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.icann.org&#34;&gt;WHOIS database&lt;/a&gt;. With our WHOIS privacy in place, your personal information that was required at registration gets replaced on the public database with our company information. So the spot that shows your address would instead show our company address. Pretty nifty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because each ccTLD is run by a separate entity though, please note that not every TLD supports WHOIS privacy. Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;big list of those that do support it&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you want to read up about the ins and outs of WHOIS privacy, &lt;a href=&#34;(https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-ins-and-outs-of-whois-privacy-and-accurate-contact-information.html&#34;&gt;this is a great place to start&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add WHOIS privacy to your domain name, click &lt;strong&gt;Domains&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then select the domain you want to add WHOIS privacy to, then click &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;enable privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s in the &lt;strong&gt;Domain Owner&lt;/strong&gt; row).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Putting your domain name to work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve registered your first domain and added all your privacy settings, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start actually using it. But before we get into &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to set things up, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what kinds of easy things you can do with your domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a website &amp;ndash; Probably the most common thing you can do with a domain is start a website. And these days, with amazing platforms like Squarespace, Big Cartel, and Tumblr, anyone can start a blog, e-commerce site, gallery page, online portfolio, forum, etc., etc. without knowing an ounce of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&#34;&gt;Get a custom email address&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Ever see someone with an email address that doesn&amp;rsquo;t end in @gmail.com, @me.com, @hotmail.com, etc.? That was set up with a using a domain name like the one you just registered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/three-steps-to-get-the-most-from-your-custom-short-url-using-bitly-and-buffer.html&#34;&gt;Shorten your links&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; When you post a link to Twitter (or some other social platforms), it&amp;rsquo;s automatically shortened to give you more characters to work with. If you want to brand that link shortening though (we&amp;rsquo;re using iwnt.me), you can get a short domain name and use it with a link shortening service like Bitly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host a podcast? Start a forum? &amp;ndash; If you can think of it, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a platform or service out there to get you started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you&amp;rsquo;re looking to accomplish, our recommendation is to start your search in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-app-marketplace.png&#34; alt=&#34;Marketplace&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever messed with domain names in the past, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across a fairly acronym-heavy setup process with DNS record types like A, CNAME, MX, etc. What we&amp;rsquo;ve done is created a system that helps you avoid needing to deal with all that—allowing you to choose platforms like Squarespace and Tumblr, then add them to your domain in a click (all the work is done for you in the background).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember here is that all the platforms in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; are hosted platforms, meaning you can use them without needing to worry about hosting space on the side. Just add the platform, sign up for it on their end, and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a platform from the Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-add-tumblr.png&#34; alt=&#34;Add Tumblr&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally you&amp;rsquo;ll run into some additional information needed on platform setups (here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-adding-squarespace-to-your-domain.html&#34;&gt;Squarespace installation guide&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but most platforms are very straightforward. Here&amp;rsquo;s the process for Tumblr, as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re logged in, click &lt;strong&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Services&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a platform you want to add, then click &lt;strong&gt;Add Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt; on the next page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit the green &lt;strong&gt;Install Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you still need to sign up for your desired platform on their end, and add your new domain name in their custom domain name menu (most platforms will have their own guide to help you along). Note that some platforms take a bit of time to detect new domain settings, so now might be a good time to walk the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Useful tip &amp;ndash; if your domain was transferred to iwantmyname from a different registrar, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to change your nameservers to iwantmyname (our instant setups won&amp;rsquo;t work otherwise). To set that up, click &lt;strong&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/strong&gt; in the dropdown under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then click &lt;strong&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/strong&gt;, then choose iwantmyname in the dropdown menu. And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to click the &lt;strong&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/strong&gt; button!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a platform that isn&amp;rsquo;t in the Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-dns-records.png&#34; alt=&#34;DNS Records&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the blog, e-commerce, portfolio, etc., etc. platform you&amp;rsquo;re looking to use isn&amp;rsquo;t in our Marketplace, you can add DNS records manually by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/strong&gt; in the dropdown under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then click &lt;strong&gt;Edit DNS Records&lt;/strong&gt;, then add your records one-by-one. Most platforms will have setup guides for a number of different registrars, so hopefully a custom iwantmyname setup guide will be on the list, but if not, just follow their general custom domain instructions and you should be fine (we&amp;rsquo;re always &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;happy to help&lt;/a&gt; as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a platform that requires your own hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-update-nameservers.png&#34; alt=&#34;Update nameservers&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a platform like Wordpress.org that requires you to find your own server space for your site to live on (for the brave, or more advanced users), you&amp;rsquo;ll have to first &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&#34;&gt;figure out who you want to be your host&lt;/a&gt;. There are hundreds of hosting companies out there, but [we usually recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/&#34;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt; for basic users and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c5a7f5e1af5e&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased some hosting space, all you have to do on our end is point your domain&amp;rsquo;s Nameservers to that service. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re using Bluehost, click &lt;strong&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/strong&gt; in the dropdown under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then click &lt;strong&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/strong&gt;, then choose Bluehost in the dropdown menu. After that, all the settings to install your platform will be through your host (and they&amp;rsquo;ll usually have their own setup guides).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we wrap this up, there are a few things we want you to remember (this is your domain credo, of sorts):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to permanently mess things up, and changes made accidentally can be removed or restored. As long as you use correct contact information, keep your billing info up-to-date, and check your email semi-regularly for important updates, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be alright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve set everything up perfectly, sometimes it takes time for things to work their way through the internet (and nothing can speed it up). Patience is key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need help, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;just send us a message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be able to help you out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And most of all, have fun with your new domain!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Thinking beyond parental leave</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Parental leave is an important topic and one that we will hear more about because there is an over-arching societal conversation starting to happen. So we began having a look around at what other companies offer and found a list of tech companies and their parental leave policies which was a good start, but not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an international team with four different nationalities and spread across as many countries (New Zealand, Germany, Canada and the US), we wanted to find something that works for everyone. We were also aiming at offering an equal option for men who should have the opportunity to negotiate some time away from work to be with their new children and to support the mother or same-sex partner. And would you believe there is still no parental leave in the US, even for most mothers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not everyone might have plans to have kids in the future—whatever the reason may be. How can we accommodate them?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ins and outs of WHOIS privacy and accurate contact information</title>
				<description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;The difference between a gTLD and a ccTLD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Requirements for information accuracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Editing gTLD contact information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Editing ccTLD contact information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, maintaining online privacy is understandably very important. Fortunately, to that end, WHOIS privacy is available for many types of domains &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;(see our full list here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling WHOIS privacy is a way to mask or hide your personal contact information as the domain registrant, so it&amp;rsquo;s not visible in &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.domaintools.com/&#34;&gt;WHOIS lookups&lt;/a&gt;. Adding it to an iwantmyname domain name is easy (as long as your domain extension supports it)—in your dashboard, just click on the domain name, then click on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;enable privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone knows about the availability of WHOIS privacy, and we&amp;rsquo;ve seen many instances where people have used altered or fake contact information when registering their domains as a step to ensure their privacy. While we understand the motivation to do this, let&amp;rsquo;s clear up why it isn&amp;rsquo;t such a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;The difference between a gTLD and a ccTLD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big thing to understand is that there are two main categories of domains.  First, you have your gTLDs (generic top-level domains), which include &amp;ldquo;classics&amp;rdquo; like .COM and the new extensions like .PHOTOS or .PIZZA. These domains are under the control of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icann.org/&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they all follow the same policies and rules about how they are registered, how much they cost, how they are renewed, and information required of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other domain category is ccTLDs (country code top-level domains). These are all the ones that end with two letters, referencing actual geographical places in the world, e.g. .CA for Canada, .IO for Indian Ocean, etc. Unlike the gTLDs with ICANN, ccTLDs are not all under the control of one organization. Each ccTLD is governed by its own registry, managed by the country or geographical area (e.g. .CA domains are managed by CIRA, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, each ccTLD has different policies and rules regarding registration, renewal, pricing, etc. Those registries can basically do what they want in this regard. This is why some offer WHOIS privacy (see the above-linked list), but many do not. This is also why a .IO domain costs $59 to register, or a .MY domain costs $149USD. The registry can set whatever price it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Requirements for information accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For gTLDs, ICANN has requirements for registrant information accuracy, which must be adhered to, or the domain registrant/owner risks the domain being suspended or deleted. This is also the case for ccTLDs, but they have their own registries&amp;rsquo; requirements, which may be more or less stringent than ICANN&amp;rsquo;s. For example, some registries require specific ID numbers for companies or individuals wanting to register a domain with their ccTLD. And some restrict who can register at all (e.g. you must be a resident of the European Union in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case for gTLDs, ccTLD domains can be suspended or deleted if the registrant contact information is not accurate and up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t ignore WDRP notices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time we hear from customers who have received a WDRP (WHOIS Data Reminder Policy) notice by email. Often they&amp;rsquo;re not sure what it&amp;rsquo;s for, or if it&amp;rsquo;s possibly a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registrars/consensus-policies/wdrp-en&#34;&gt;WDRP notices are legitimate&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to read them and to check your registration information to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s up to date. You can do this in your iwantmyname account dashboard by clicking on your domain name, then clicking on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;edit contacts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Editing gTLD contact information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-18-contact-details.png&#34; alt=&#34;contact details&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For gTLDs, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to update the domain contacts yourself and save the new settings at the bottom of the page. You can use the same contact name and information for all four (registrant/owner, admin, tech, and billing), or you can use different people or contact details (as long as it&amp;rsquo;s accurate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s particularly important to be sure that the email address set for the registrant/owner and admin contacts are valid and that you can access email there, as important notifications about renewals, transfers, etc. are sent to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive a WDRP notice, it is important that you follow the instructions and ensure that your information is up to date. Otherwise, ICANN is authorized to suspend or even delete your domain name, and you may not have any way to get it back. If you are concerned about your privacy, remember that adding WHOIS privacy &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; mask all of your personal details and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, you can add WHOIS privacy for domain types that support it when you&amp;rsquo;re logged in to your iwantmyname account. In your dashboard, click on the domain name, then click on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;enable privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Editing ccTLD contact information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ccTLDs, sometimes you can update the domain contacts yourself. Sometimes you can update all of the contacts &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; registrant/owner. And sometimes you can update all of the other contacts and parts of the registrant/owner contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fairly common that the customer cannot make changes to the registrant/owner&amp;rsquo;s first/last name or company name themselves. This is because whatever person and/or company is listed as the registrant/owner contact is the legal owner of the domain. Those updates must be done at the administrative level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that the registrant contact, particularly, is accurate and up to date. Sometimes when you transfer a domain, it will still show the old registrar or hosting company&amp;rsquo;s contact information, especially if you had a privacy service turned on. You will need to update that after the transfer. (Use the &amp;ldquo;edit contacts&amp;rdquo; instructions listed above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for transferring a domain from one person or company to another. You will need to ensure that you update the domain contacts to your information, otherwise the domain still legally belongs to the person whose name is on it, even if you paid for it fair and square. (Domain ownership disputes tend to get very messy, often require legal consultation, and are slow to resolve.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ccTLDs require more complicated administrative functions to update domain contacts. In those instances, customers need to contact us as we will need to take care of those functions for you. They are usually done in other systems connected to the registries. Sometimes these changes have an associated cost. Most commonly there is a cost associated when a specific ccTLD registry categorizes changing a domain&amp;rsquo;s registrant contact as an &amp;ldquo;owner change&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are special requirements, processes, or costs required for updating a domain&amp;rsquo;s contact information, we will let you know beforehand. In certain cases, it can be fairly involved, requiring forms and other processes, but we will provide information for all steps, and take care of most of the heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ICANN wants to take away your rights to use WHOIS privacy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet’s governing body &lt;a href=&#34;http://icann.org&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; is thinking of another controversial move, after the introduction of an (email) address verification process &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html&#34;&gt;that can make your website go dark&lt;/a&gt;. Just this time, it’s an attack on people’s privacy, and that’s something you shouldn’t take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savedomainprivacy.org&#34;&gt;savedomainprivacy.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed new rules, Providers would be required to monitor your use of domain names and websites. Providers could be forced to terminate your privacy service and be required to publish your contact data in WHOIS. Likewise, Providers could be required to give your private contact details to anyone complaining that your website violates their trademark or copyright. None of these scenarios would require a court order, search warrant, or due process of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize that Providers do not want criminals to abuse these services to hide their online activities from law enforcement. But some of the proposed changes would treat all users equally, regardless of their intent. For millions of legitimate users, these services are no more suspicious than getting an unlisted telephone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same people who already thought you could prevent crime by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html&#34;&gt;requiring domains to be verified&lt;/a&gt; which only resulted in innocent people having their websites disabled. Nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will see exactly the same thing happening if these new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;whois privacy&lt;/a&gt; policies are introduced. People who absolutely need to remain private could have their contact details exposed by anyone—without helping to catch criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this is a not-so-great (i.e. stupid) idea as much as we do, please &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savedomainprivacy.org/sign-the-petition/&#34;&gt;make your voice heard to ICANN now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Relaunching my domain name based personal web presence</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m publishing this on Medium and not on my own domain name. Because it allows me to get my thoughts out of the system and share it with a wider audience until I‘ve made up my mind where and how to relaunch my personal web presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why relaunch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve got my own domain name, and it feels like I’m not making the best use of it at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never made the switch to English for personal long form writing since moving from Germany to Australia, and later to New Zealand. As a non-native English speaker, I often feel my writing isn’t good enough, and the following quote was a kick in the butt: “It is better to write not-well than to not write.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had plenty of discussions about personal sites and our individual voices on the web at work. Over the last few years, I’ve been writing quite a bit on the iwantmyname blog which is simply not me as a person, and I want to change this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>What to do if the domain name you want is taken</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve started your own business, club, or blog, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait to share it with the world. There&amp;rsquo;s still work to be done, but the primary focus is now on branding. You do some critical thinking about your product and your industry, come up with a list of potential brand names, and pick one that fits perfectly—it&amp;rsquo;s clever, descriptive, and extremely easy to remember. Now to register the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or not. It&amp;rsquo;s taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to get &amp;ldquo;the perfect domain&amp;rdquo; can be really frustrating, or, at the very least, really expensive. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/24/after-losing-over-25000-registrations-in-two-days-com-back-below-113-million-berlin-top-40k/&#34;&gt;Well over 100 million .COM domains are currently registered,&lt;/a&gt;, and the estimated total of registered domains topped a quarter of a &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; last year. More likely than not, &amp;ldquo;the good ones&amp;rdquo; are already taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a person to do? Well, there are a few options, which we&amp;rsquo;ll break down for you in this series on getting the right domain for your brand, even if the name you really want is already registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;I think the domain I want is taken. Help!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;What is domain squatting/cybersquatting?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Someone has registered a domain with my trademark. What do I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;How do I find out if the domain I want becomes available?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;If I can&amp;rsquo;t get the domain I want, how do I pick a memorable alternative?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;I think the domain I want is taken. Help!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first step is to enter the domain name you&amp;rsquo;re interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The list provided will show you which domain extensions (like .COM and .CO) are available with your desired name, and also which have already been registered. (And keep in mind that not every registered domain has an active website. You can have as many domains as you want as long as you keep paying for them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a domain name is not showing as available, some reasons might be that the owner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is using it for a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is planning to use it on a site that&amp;rsquo;s not launched yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is only using the domain for email addresses (e.g. hello@theperfectdomain.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is keeping it because the name is similar to a domain he/she is actively using and the domain is being redirected to their site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has an idea for the future and registered the domain in advance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is just fond of the name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wants to prevent other entities from using his/her name or brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can I just register the same name with a different domain extension?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, if &amp;ldquo;theperfectdomain&lt;em&gt;.com&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is already registered, you could always just register the same domain name with a different extension, e.g. &amp;ldquo;theperfectdomain&lt;em&gt;.info&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The biggest potential problem with using alternative extensions is that people could forget your domain, and by default go to the .COM domain instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely though, people are embracing top-level domains (TLDs) other than .COM. (In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, the TLD is the part of the domain after the dot, e.g. the &amp;ldquo;COM&amp;rdquo; in theperfectdomain.com) And with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; hitting the market, ranging from city names (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&#34;&gt;.LONDON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;) to hobbies and professions (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-accountants&#34;&gt;.ACCOUNTANTS&lt;/a&gt;) to surnames (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kim&#34;&gt;.KIM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wang&#34;&gt;.WANG&lt;/a&gt;), it&amp;rsquo;s becoming more normal by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it will take time for people to get used to this new world where anything is .POSSIBLE. (Note: .POSSIBLE is not actually one of the new gTLDs, though it should be.) Just be aware of the hopefully short-term drawbacks to using a TLD other than .COM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t I just get a username on a big web platform?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having your own domain name, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, is a far better option than building your online presence on top of another service&amp;rsquo;s URL, e.g. yourshop.shopify.com or facebook.com/yourcompany. This practice of building your brand, service, or web presence on another organization&amp;rsquo;s platform is an example of &amp;ldquo;sharecropping&amp;rdquo;, and can be problematic for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this sharecropping setup, the platform you&amp;rsquo;re hosted on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;controls how your presence can look or function (e.g. templates and tiered feature offerings depending on how much you pay).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can change services or raise rates, leaving you little recourse, since not accepting/paying could mean losing your site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can control how much exposure you get. There&amp;rsquo;ve been lots of articles about issues with brands on Facebook getting ever-lessening exposure of their content to their fans if they don&amp;rsquo;t pay for advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can limit your access to analytics, making it hard to know how large your audience is, what they&amp;rsquo;re doing on your site, or where they&amp;rsquo;re engaging when they&amp;rsquo;re there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can simply take your site offline without much notice, explanation or recourse if you are deemed to have violated terms of service or other issues. It can take a lot of time and frustration to get these issues sorted out, and all the while your site is unavailable to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always switch domains later, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to start with a web address you control while you build up your search engine visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;If someone isn&amp;rsquo;t using the domain I want, is there a way I can just have it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Well, not without the owner agreeing to transfer it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a domain is registered to someone else, they have paid for it and own it. Having an active website isn&amp;rsquo;t required to own a domain, and as long as the person pays to renew ownership, no one else can have the domain, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be using it—unless that person agrees to transfer or sell the domain, or lets it expire. (Or, in some cases, if their ownership or usage of the domain violates someone else&amp;rsquo;s trademark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking a registrar to take a domain for you won&amp;rsquo;t work, either. Registrars have no more legal right to remove it from the owner than you do, and this applies globally, not just in a specific country. Think of it in reverse: if someone else decided they wanted &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; domain, would you be okay with us just taking it from you and giving it to them, regardless of what you were doing with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;What is domain squatting/cybersquatting?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, domain squatting (occasionally still called cybersquatting) is where people register domains that are closely related to a trademark or brand, with the intention of selling them off for (sometimes very large) profit. By doing this, squatters are gambling that the company or person targeted will just pay what the squatter wants to avoid expensive legal proceedings and the risk of being denied the rights to that domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a registrant might register &amp;ldquo;thisismycompany.ca&amp;rdquo; in hopes that the company, which is based in New Zealand, for example, would start doing a lot of business in Canada and want to buy that domain. Or if a company was launching a new product called SuperNamer, and a registrant who didn&amp;rsquo;t represent the company registered &amp;ldquo;supernamer.com&amp;rdquo; to try and make the company pay for that domain so they could launch their new product with the most recognizable domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain squatting can also be done accidentally by someone with good intentions, e.g. a big fan of a particular celebrity, character or sports team. That person could register the domain, e.g. &amp;ldquo;batman.com&amp;rdquo; and set up a fan site dedicated to all things Batman, even though the site isn&amp;rsquo;t owned by DC Comics, who own the rights to the Batman character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the person who set up the site might just be a huge Batman fan, but the person could also be hoping that DC will offer them a lot of money for the domain to avoid legal wrangling (though, in this case, the squatter wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, resolving domain squatting requires determining several things. Is the domain name part of someone&amp;rsquo;s trademark? Is the domain name part of a well-known brand, even if not trademarked? (Like a celebrity&amp;rsquo;s identity, e.g. it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely anyone&amp;rsquo;s going to assume &amp;ldquo;georgeclooney.com&amp;rdquo; is about anyone other than the actor.) Was the person who bought the domain acting in &amp;ldquo;good faith&amp;rdquo; (e.g. big fan) or &amp;ldquo;bad faith&amp;rdquo; (i.e. hoping to profit from identity assumptions or sale)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad faith domain squatting is illegal, but can still be expensive to resolve through legal channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is the difference between domain speculation and squatting?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no single, definitive (i.e. legally binding) definition, but generally squatting implies &amp;ldquo;bad faith&amp;rdquo; intent on the part of the person or company that has registered the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means they have no interest in or intentions of creating a website for the domain or otherwise using it (like it becoming the main web presence for their business). That person just bought it to sell it for more than they paid for it (ideally much more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain speculation, on the other hand, involves registering domains that might be useful or of interest, but which don&amp;rsquo;t block an existing trademark or brand. For example, instead of registering a variant of an existing company&amp;rsquo;s domain, a domain speculator would register something more general, like &amp;ldquo;weselldomains.com&amp;rdquo;, in hopes that some domain registrar might want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculators are often more open about the fact that the domains in their portfolio are for sale, as well. Whereas squatters might set up a basic page to make it marginally look like the domain is in use, or create a parking page (a temporary page, usually used to as a placeholder until a real site is ready) full of ads to try to get click traffic for extra revenue until they can sell the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some squatters own many domains, though some will only target a few, since the more domains you own that haven&amp;rsquo;t sold yet, the more money you&amp;rsquo;ve invested without return. Speculators often own a large portfolio of domains, targeting various industries with a selection of relevant terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain squatting, if a person&amp;rsquo;s or company&amp;rsquo;s actions are deemed to be that, is illegal. Some countries have specific laws against squatting that are more specific than standard trademark law. However, since the internet is a global entity, issues of jurisdiction can arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;What do I do if has registered a domain with my trademark?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to follow the instructions outlined in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp&#34;&gt;ICANN&amp;rsquo;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy&lt;/a&gt; (UDRP). Consulting a lawyer may also be useful in ensuring your case is as strong as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that even though you own the trademark, a domain squatter will still likely fight to keep the domain, since it was purchased in the first place to make money. Getting the domain name may be expensive, but if you own the trademark (or are a celebrity), you have a good chance of getting the domain from the squatter. Really, it comes down to whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can I buy the domain I want from the owner?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly. Certainly you can contact the person or company and see if they&amp;rsquo;re interested in selling it. Be aware though that the person who owns the domain is under no obligation to sell it, may want a lot more money for it than you&amp;rsquo;re willing or able to pay, and may not be very interested in negotiating the price. Best to start off by casually (and politely) asking if the owner would be interested in selling without sharing too much about who you are and why you want the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an interested buyer, your only leverage is how much you&amp;rsquo;re willing or able to spend, and your ability to walk away if you can&amp;rsquo;t come to agreeable terms. It&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to have other options available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;rsquo;t order business cards or marketing collateral with a specific domain name on them if you don&amp;rsquo;t absolutely positively own the domain already. That&amp;rsquo;s just setting yourself up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do I find out who owns the domain I want?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out who owns a domain, try a &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.domaintools.com/&#34;&gt;WHOIS lookup&lt;/a&gt;. Typically the contact information of the person who owns the domain will appear on the search results page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if they are using a privacy service, there should still be an email address you can use to contact the owner, or at least a domain holding company. If a domain is held by a company wanting to make money on selling domains, they&amp;rsquo;re probably going to make it easy to get a hold of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How much is the domain I want worth?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That depends on a lot of factors. There is no service you can check to see what a given domain should be worth. Any site that claims to tell you what your domain name or social media account is worth is just using some arbitrary calculation. They are just for fun and have no legal use or bearing on actual domain value or prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any domain is worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it (assuming the owner is interested in selling at all). Note that some domain owners have pretty grandiose ideas about what their domain is worth, or think they can get rich quick off some desperate buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things that can influence the cost of a domain name. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the word(s) in the name are simple, clear and common, including standard spellings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the word(s) is a recognizable person, company, product, etc. (i.e. don&amp;rsquo;t expect to get &amp;ldquo;coke.com&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the domain is already in use (as noted, there&amp;rsquo;s a website, email addresses, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the domain name is related to something that may become important in the future, e.g. an event, new product, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how badly the owner can tell that you want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how badly the owner needs or wants the money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much you appear to be willing or able to pay for it (e.g. there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that the price may be higher if a company wants a domain than if just an individual person does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legal status of the domain (e.g. is it a registered trademark)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the state of the industry or economy (e.g. during a tech bubble, like many things, domain name prices may become inflated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;How do I find out if the domain I want becomes available?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable contacting the domain owner directly, or you tried and didn&amp;rsquo;t get a response, you can attempt to procure the domain when it expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is anything but a guaranteed strategy, however. Most registrars remind their customers early and often prior to domains expiring. Many registrars also auto-renew domains by default as long as the customer&amp;rsquo;s payment details are accurate and up to date. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184422&#34;&gt;iwantmyname does both of these things for their customers.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a domain&amp;rsquo;s ownership does expire, many registrars give their customers a grace period after expiration so they can still renew it, sometimes at a considerably increased cost. (This pricing is set by the registries, not registrars like iwantmyname.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also try a domain monitoring service, which alerts you to status changes and expirations for your domains, or others that are of interest to you. Be aware though that this offering can be an upsell attempt by some registrars. (iwantmyname does not offer this service.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backordering services are also popular, and if you want a maximum chance of getting the domain if/when it expires, we recommend using all of them. Most of these services will only charge you if they manage to procure the domain, but some charge in advance. Here are a few popular options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://namejet.com&#34;&gt;NameJet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://snapnames.com&#34;&gt;SnapNames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://backorderzone.com&#34;&gt;BackorderZone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pool.com&#34;&gt;Pool.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can you make an offer for a domain name for me?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service is called brokerage, and iwantmyname does not offer any domain brokerage services. We recommend contacting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sedo.com/us/buy-domains/domain-brokerage/&#34;&gt;Sedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://domainagents.com/&#34;&gt;DomainAgents&lt;/a&gt; to assist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brokers will do is contact the domain owner (if they can), then make an offer for the domain for you, handle negotiations, and finalize the agreement to purchase and transfer the domain. You will pay the broker a fee in addition to whatever price you pay for the domain name itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;If I can&#39;t get the domain I want, how do I pick a memorable alternative?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, you could look for a variant of &amp;ldquo;theperfectdomain&amp;rdquo;. But be aware of potential confusion if the domain extension (e.g. .NET / .GURU / .CA) is the only difference between your domain and someone else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try small changes to the domain name you want, like adding or dropping an article. Instead of &amp;ldquo;companyname&amp;rdquo;, use &amp;ldquo;thecompanyname&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;getproductname&amp;rdquo;. Again, there is still a good chance people will get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of directly referring to your company, group, or topic name, you could focus on something relevant and important, like what the product or service enables you to do. A photographer could register a domain using &amp;ldquo;shoot&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;snap&amp;rdquo;, or referencing &amp;ldquo;memories&amp;rdquo;. A group of pilots could use &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;wings,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;soar&amp;rdquo;. Using slang or terminology common among your group could make for a memorable domain name as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is where you or your organization is located geographically. Should you embrace the international nature of the Internet, or stay local? Should you use a gTLD or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) that shows your roots, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&#34;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt; for Canada or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&#34;&gt;.NZ&lt;/a&gt; for New Zealand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also use a TLD to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; the domain and create an interesting and relevant phrase. For example, if you wanted to register &amp;ldquo;bobswaffles.com&amp;rdquo;, but it was taken, instead you could register &amp;ldquo;bobswaffl.es&amp;rdquo; (using &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain&#34;&gt;.ES&lt;/a&gt;, Spain&amp;rsquo;s ccTLD).

Seriously, with no skill going in, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to build sites, stores, photo galleries, and blogs in minutes. It&amp;rsquo;s that intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s not quite as intuitive though is the domain setup. We pride ourselves in providing one-click installs to a ton of platforms, but sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s an extra step involved that can turn that one click into a bunch of clicks. Have no fear though, with this short guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll have your domain working with your Squarespace site in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Start your Squarespace site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Domains &amp;gt; Connect Third-Party Domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Enter your domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Select iwantmyname from the Domain Provider list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;Click okay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;Copy your verification code (it&amp;rsquo;s right under Host)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-7&#34;&gt;Add Squarespace to your domain in iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-8&#34;&gt;Paste your verification code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-9&#34;&gt;Back to Squarespace, hit refresh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-10&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re all done!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;1. Start your Squarespace site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get started with Squarespace by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://squarespace.com&#34;&gt;Squarespace homepage&lt;/a&gt;, choosing a template, then clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Start With This Design&lt;/strong&gt; button. There are a couple quick questions you can answer after that, or you can skip them for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-home.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Squarespace home&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;2. Go to Settings &gt; Domains &gt; Connect Third-Party Domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s side navigation, click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Domains&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Connect a Third-Party Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-settings.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Settings&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;3. Enter your domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your domain name in the Domain Name field provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-domain-iwantmyblog.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Add domain&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;4. Select iwantmyname from the Domain Provider list&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/strong&gt; from the Domain Provider dropdown list. Click &lt;strong&gt;Connect Domain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-select-iwantmyname.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dropdown iwantmyname&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;5. Click okay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is now linking your domain. Click &lt;strong&gt;okay&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-in-progress.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Click okay&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;6. Copy your verification code (it&#39;s right under Host)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy that long string of letters and numbers listed first under the Host column (it&amp;rsquo;ll look somehting like: abcde1fg2h3ijk4lmn5o). This is the verification code you&amp;rsquo;ll add in the iwantmyname dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-host.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Copy string&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-7&#34;&gt;7. Add Squarespace to your domain in iwantmyname&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open a new window and log into your iwantmyname account, then head to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/setup/Squarespace/&#34;&gt;Squarespace app setup page&lt;/a&gt;. Click Add Squarespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-8&#34;&gt;8. Paste your verification code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve already signed up for squarespace, so now add the verification code to the &amp;lsquo;Unique verification code&amp;rsquo; input. Then click &lt;strong&gt;Install Squarespace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-unique-ver.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Unique Code&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-9&#34;&gt;9. Back to Squarespace, hit refresh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on your Squarespace window, if you click &lt;strong&gt;Refresh&lt;/strong&gt;, everything should now say Correct. Sometimes it takes a bit (up to a few hours) for these things to work through the internet though, so don&amp;rsquo;t be alarmed if things don&amp;rsquo;t look correct right away. Just jump to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-05-11-squarespace-correct.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Correct&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-10&#34;&gt;10. You&#39;re all done!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re all done! Have fun building your Squarespace site!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Taking stock of our 2015 community involvement</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being involved in the local community is vastly important to us, so this year we made a conscious decision to support more events that at least some of the iwantmyname team could actively participate in. Since we are already one-third of the way through 2015, I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time to take stock of what has been achieved so far and look at where we plan to go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekends loom large in our consciousness, and this year has been no exception. Organisers of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.startupweekend.co.nz/&#34;&gt;Startup Weekends here in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have a busy schedule planned, and we&amp;rsquo;ve already been lucky enough to sponsor and participate in the recent Wellington event. Lenz and I put on our mentor hats, Kevin Ingersoll participated in a team, and Coco the domain dog lent moral support by snoozing blissfully throughout. So imagine our excitement when the judges announced that Kevin&amp;rsquo;s team had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iwantmynameNZ/status/587195037274005504&#34;&gt;scored a well-earned win&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrills of Startup Weekend were soon followed by intellectual debate and thorough workshopping of the open source paradigm at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://opensourceopensociety.com/&#34;&gt;Open Source Open Society conference&lt;/a&gt;, held in conjunction with Github and Enspiral. We employ open source technologies and open thinking &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html&#34;&gt;throughout our business&lt;/a&gt;, so it seemed like the perfect event for us to be a part of. There was also a cool closing party with a funky, indie DJ on tap, so nobody wanted to leave—but that&amp;rsquo;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also remain keen backers of the PHP Meetup and JavaScript Meetup in our city, and have been helping out with the R9 initiative, an experimental incubator aiming to solve important business problems in the government sector by using lean methodologies. Many of these events have our local tech business incubator &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativehq.co.nz/&#34;&gt;Creative HQ&lt;/a&gt; at their heart, so we&amp;rsquo;re more than thrilled to be announcing a strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this week on, we will be shouting the beers at the highly popular &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/StartupGarage/&#34;&gt;Startup Garage&lt;/a&gt; Meetup. Each month, Creative HQ hosts an interesting speaker from the start-up world, many of whom bring wisdom from afar. Recent appearances have included SXSW organiser Shawn O&amp;rsquo;Keefe and President of Y Combinator, Sam Altman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 is shaping up to be a big year for community involvement here at iwantmyname, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to make further inroads in the local start-up ecosystem. If you see us around, come say hi! We&amp;rsquo;d love to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making customer support sustainable with a small team based on a tiny island</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what service you offer or product you sell, a good chunk of any business is customer support. But unlike many other aspects of running a business, how companies handle customer support can vary widely, even among companies in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our little corner of the Internet, the domain industry, we have a couple of unique challenges. First, domain registration is a comparatively low margin business, so to keep our business afloat, we rely on the support of a lot of customers. Tens of thousands, with 150,000+ domains under management. And no matter how stable your platform, when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with that many moving parts, any flaw, bug, or confusing process will be uncovered very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is the clock. Most of the iwantmyname team is in New Zealand, but what happens when it&amp;rsquo;s 10pm, and someone has an issue in London, where it&amp;rsquo;s only 11am? Is it acceptable to pass on the expectation that people need sleep? It&amp;rsquo;s an honest question, and a concern for many small companies that can&amp;rsquo;t afford to have 24-hour call centers or offices all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is an instant answer world without any face-to-face dialogue, which strips a lot of the humanity out of the process. And we all fall into it—if my website breaks, I expect instant answers, but if my car breaks, I know I have to set an appointment during business hours. It&amp;rsquo;s all about setting expectations, and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the hardest things for businesses to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&#34;embed-responsive-item&#34; src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/j62Hmj6SMpJV6?html5=true&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle the support load, companies can go a few different directions. As I stated before, they can stock up a support team or outsource all the support to a third party, but that&amp;rsquo;s expensive, impersonal, and honestly, a little underwhelming in the experience department. Sure, there are a lot of quick Q&amp;amp;A type issues that can be handled quickly by anyone with basic knowledge of the domain industry, but if you have a real problem, you want real solutions. Nothing is more aggravating than dealing with a support layer that clearly won&amp;rsquo;t be able to solve your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue with stocking up a support team is our rather unique salary structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve written about it before&lt;/a&gt;, but our philosophy from the start has been to pay everyone on the team a flat wage. On the customer side, it may be frustrating to not see us hire 20 low-wage support specialists, but we strongly believe in companies providing livable wages to their employees. As Lenz, one of our co-founders, has said in the past, the wellbeing of the team is just as important as the well-being of the company. People are important, and as they grow, the company grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after years of dual roles and unsustainable hours, it was clear that a distributed support team was a must. We needed a better way to support the Americas on Fridays (which are Saturdays in NZ), and we needed a way to cover the middle of the world during normal business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we hired Melle (last year), who in eastern Canada could take on American business hours—and what a difference it made. With her in Canada and the rest of the dual-role supporters in NZ, we could roughly cover 17 hours of the day, Tuesday-Friday, with people working a typical 8am-5pm day, then nine hours on NZ Mondays and Saturdays (Fridays in Canada). But still, if someone had an issue in London on Monday at 9am, it would be in the wee early morning for Melle, and well past dinner for the New Zealanders. Life was certainly better, but there were still support gaps—and our brave co-founder Paul was still sometimes working seven days a week to make sure the support load never got out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth is a tricky thing with a small, bootstrapped team, but our trajectory for 2015 and beyond led us to two very important decisions. To create the best possible experience for our customers, we&amp;rsquo;d need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a UI designer to help build a solid interface (which, through organization and clear instructions, will hopefully cut down our future support load quite a bit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a second supporter in Europe to cover our gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Kevin, who was hired a few months back, has been hard at work on new interface ideas. And our newest iwantmynamer, Steffi, is working through support cases from her house in Germany (and she&amp;rsquo;s quite awesome at it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, with three support &amp;ldquo;teams&amp;rdquo; scattered around the planet, we&amp;rsquo;re roughly covering 23 hours of the day, Tuesday-Friday, then 15 hours on Saturday, all without stretching any of our work schedules beyond a reasonable amount. New Zealand Sundays are still a hole for us, so we typically only cover urgent cases then, but as long as we set the right expectations, our email-based support system is perfect for getting everything worked out in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often get asked why we don&amp;rsquo;t offer a phone service or an instant-on online chat, and the answer is simple—instant communication is inefficient, and often leads to answers that aren&amp;rsquo;t fully thought out or articulated well. Quite a few things have to happen to answer a support question successfully. We have to get the problem, understand the problem, find the problem, take the steps to fix it, and then break down an easily actionable solution. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s as easy as sending a link, but other times issues need to be handled by multiple people in multiple places (registries, platforms, etc.), which aren&amp;rsquo;t always under our control. And that takes time—especially when there are questions in the queue coming in from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;email-only support&lt;/a&gt;, we can get to each question as fast as humanly possible without wasting our customers&amp;rsquo; valuable time sitting on hold or finding their way through strange automated systems. And with our support answers all in written form, we can easily build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;knowledge base&lt;/a&gt; full of quick answers to common questions. It&amp;rsquo;s been working well for us so far (&lt;a href=&#34;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&#34;&gt;96% love it!&lt;/a&gt;), and hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll only get better as our interface becomes easier and easier to use and navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Everything you need to know about domain hacks</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-29-domain-dot-hack.png&#34; alt=&#34;domain dot hack&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of domain registration (the dark times before the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; were launched), there was a point where it was quite hard to find a domain that was both short and memorable. Many of the good &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; domain names were taken, as were the more common words and phrases in various country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&#34;&gt;.CO.UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&#34;&gt;.CA&lt;/a&gt;. So what do people commonly do when there&amp;rsquo;s a shortage of something that&amp;rsquo;s in demand? They get creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of a domain hack is to take a word or brand, like iwantmyname, and use the domain extension as part of the word. So instead of iwantmyname.com, a domain hacker would go with iwantmyna.me (using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; TLD) or iwantmy.name (using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&#34;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt; TLD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are domain hacks useful?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-29-street-art.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;street art&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is street art useful? Not really, but it sure is fun to look at. With a domain hack, you can create a domain name that&amp;rsquo;s uniquely yours—one that may align with your whimsical brand mentality better than a .COM ever could. If the last few letters in your name happen to be a ccTLD, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland&#34;&gt;.IS&lt;/a&gt; in Chris, then you have yourself a good domain hack (chr.is). If the last few letters in your brand happen to be a new gTLD, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&#34;&gt;.PRESS&lt;/a&gt; in Express, then you have yourself another (ex.press). Or if you just want to make something up, like beeris.gd&amp;hellip; you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as we like domain hacks though, there are some downsides you should be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a domain hack for your primary domain might not be a good idea (we recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1418597-how-do-i-set-up-forwarding-with-my-domain-&#34;&gt;forwarding&lt;/a&gt; domain hacks to a primary domain). With more and more people using search engines and social media to browse the web this is less of an issue, but if you go with anything other than .COM or your local ccTLD, you&amp;rsquo;re bound to get people typing in the wrong thing. For instance, if our primary domain was iwantmyna.me, I&amp;rsquo;d guess that at least half (probably more) would reflexively type in iwantmyname.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain hacks are hard to say out loud. Again, as more and more people navigate with search engines and social it&amp;rsquo;s less of a big deal, but if you&amp;rsquo;re in an interview or meeting and have to say your domain name, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound like you&amp;rsquo;re stumbling over yourself. Just try to say chr.is out loud. &amp;ldquo;c-h-r-dot-i-s.&amp;rdquo; Or possibly &amp;ldquo;chris, but with the dot before the i-s.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to say &amp;ldquo;chris.com.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about domain hacks for URL shortening?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-29-short-link.png&#34; alt=&#34;Short link&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Twitter was first created, links were a real problem. Just picture it—you have 140 characters to complete a thought, and links can be quite long. If you wanted to send a link to our .COM page (iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial), you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a hefty 67 characters. To get around that link bloat, a bunch of companies created shortening solutions which linked desired (long) URL&amp;rsquo;s to a short URL, like bit.ly/XXXXXX or ow.ly/XXXXXX (the XXXXXX being a randomly generated, unique string of characters). Then, using custom domain names, you could brand your short URL&amp;rsquo;s using your own custom domain name, so instead of bit.ly/XXXXXX, tweets would show something like iwmn.me/XXXXXX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Twitter wraps everything in their t.co URL shortener (which uses the original URL&amp;rsquo;s metadata to show a truncated version of the original URL), but companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&#34;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; are still proving useful by giving users valuable link analytics for their tweets (or other social posts). If you have a data-driven approach to social media, link shortening platforms are still quite useful. But they certainly aren&amp;rsquo;t the must-have tools they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Are there any tools for finding domain hacks?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-29-domain-hack.png&#34; alt=&#34;iwantmyname search&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not specifically looking for one, domain hacks can be tricky to think up. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;iwantmyname domain search&lt;/a&gt; has a basic domain hack finder built in. Just type any word in, and the second result (if applicable) will be a domain hack using one of our many domain extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a bit more though, try doing a search over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://domainr.com&#34;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt;. Doing the same search I did above (whatismydomainname), they pulled out some crazy stuff like whatismydomainn.am/e, whatismydoma.in.na/me, and whatismydomain.na/me. Pretty fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published a fairly &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-getting-the-right-domain-name-for-your-brand.html&#34;&gt;extensive guide&lt;/a&gt; a while back to help you figure out what to do if there&amp;rsquo;s a domain you want that&amp;rsquo;s already been registered, or similar issues. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t go into a lot of detail about exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to contact the current owner of a domain that you&amp;rsquo;re interested in acquiring though. Or what to do if you do manage to get in touch and make an offer. If you&amp;rsquo;re in this boat, we have some tips on how to navigate these waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Contacting a registrant &amp;ndash; WHOIS lookup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Registrant email address considerations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Registrant is unreachable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Domain brokerage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve contacted the domain owner&amp;hellip; now what?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve come to an agreement&amp;hellip; now what?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-7&#34;&gt;Anything else?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Contacting a registrant - WHOIS lookup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to your favorite &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.domaintools.com/&#34;&gt;WHOIS lookup site&lt;/a&gt;, you can enter the domain and get the publicly available details of who owns the domain. Be aware that not all WHOIS lookups are official and present accurate information. Also be aware that sometimes registries (like for &lt;a href=&#34;http://nic.io/&#34;&gt;ccTLDs such as .IO&lt;/a&gt;) have their own WHOIS lookups, which may provide different or additional details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you want the registrant contact email address, as the registrant is the domain&amp;rsquo;s legal owner. gTLDs have four registrant contacts: registrant/owner, admin, technical, and billing. These can all be the same person/organization, or four different ones. Some ccTLDs, like .UK, only have two contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Registrant email address considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, just finding an email address for the registrant doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee contact. Particularly if someone has owned a domain for a long time, they may not use the email address anymore that they provided for registration. Lots of things can change: leaving school, getting hacked, and changing addresses, or simply upgrading the email hosting you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, many email clients have stringent spam filtering, and emails from addresses that they&amp;rsquo;ve never received email from before may not be allowed through automatically. There are lots of articles out there outlining other spam filter triggers. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mailchimp.com/most-common-spam-filter-triggers/&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example.&lt;/a&gt; These are good things to be aware of for how you craft your email to the owner of the domain you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people also use WHOIS privacy services, either provided by their registrar (&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425&#34;&gt;more information about ours&lt;/a&gt;) or by a third-party service. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s obvious when one of these services is in place. For example, for customers using our new WHOIS privacy service, information for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whoistrustee.com/&#34;&gt;WhoisTrustee&lt;/a&gt; will be shown instead of a person or organization&amp;rsquo;s contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be email addresses shown for the contacts when a WHOIS privacy service is in place, but there&amp;rsquo;s a chance that the registrant cannot receive email sent to them. (For example, if the underlying email address is outdated or the forwarding filters out certain messages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Registrant is unreachable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever the reason, it is quite possible the registrant&amp;rsquo;s contact information is not available for the domain you want. Obviously, this presents a problem. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a solveable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time people who can&amp;rsquo;t get contact information for a domain they want contact us to ask us for that information, or to ask us to contact the domain owner for them. We can&amp;rsquo;t speak for other registrars, but our policy is not to do this. We take customers&amp;rsquo; privacy very seriously. Additionally, we are not in the brokerage business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that unless the domain is allowed to expire and is released, you may have no way of acquiring it. In these cases we recommend having some viable alternatives. And make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve secured a domain name &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; printing signs, business cards, etc. (You&amp;rsquo;d be surprised how often people don&amp;rsquo;t do this&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Domain brokerage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in having a third party try to contact a domain&amp;rsquo;s owner for you, we recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sedo.com/us/buy-domains/domain-brokerage/&#34;&gt;Sedo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://domainagents.com/&#34;&gt;DomainAgents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brokerage services will do is contact the domain owner (if they can), then make an offer for the domain for you, handle negotiations, and finalize the agreement to purchase and transfer the domain. In addition to whatever price you pay for the domain, you will also pay a fee to the broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;You&#39;ve contacted the domain owner... now what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s up to you, really. First, you need to see if the person is interested in parting with the domain. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea, when you&amp;rsquo;re looking up the WHOIS details, to check the date on which the domain was registered. If someone has had the domain for a decade, there may be pretty good odds that they&amp;rsquo;re not interested in getting rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;rsquo;s possible the person registered the domain hoping to sell it, but the right buyer just hadn&amp;rsquo;t come along until you did. And, as we&amp;rsquo;ve previously mentioned, just because there is no website up for the domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s not in use or not wanted. There are a lot of ways to use domains that don&amp;rsquo;t involve publicly accessible websites. (And even if the domain isn&amp;rsquo;t being used for anything, no, we (&lt;em&gt;nor any other registrar&lt;/em&gt;) can&amp;rsquo;t just take it for you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you can do is contact the owner and hope they receive the message and reply. If they don&amp;rsquo;t reply, or they say no, there&amp;rsquo;s not much you can do. If they are interested, then you have a chance. And typically, if someone is interested in selling a domain, they&amp;rsquo;ll make it quite easy to contact them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to know beforehand how much you&amp;rsquo;re willing to spend on the domain. Some domains are quite reasonable, others very, very expensive. Essentially, the domain is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Even if the owner says they&amp;rsquo;re willing to sell, if they want a million dollars and you don&amp;rsquo;t have or aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to pay that, then the domain might as well not be for sale at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, sounding too interested (read: desperate) can make the asking price go up steeply and quickly. And there&amp;rsquo;s really nothing you can do about it, except walk away. So, again, having a budget and an alternative plan is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;We&#39;ve come to an agreement... now what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&amp;rsquo;ve managed to contact the domain owner, they were interested in selling, and now you&amp;rsquo;ve made a deal. How do you actually get the domain? Well, it depends. For gTLDs (e.g. .COM) the transfer process is standardized. &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1336688&#34;&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s information on the requirements here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ccTLDs there can be a lot of variance in what&amp;rsquo;s required to transfer, so if you have trouble figuring it out or getting started, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the domain owner is an iwantmyname customer and so are you, you can do what&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184478&#34;&gt;an internal transfer or move.&lt;/a&gt;. (Provided the domain is old enough, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to transfer the domain from the owner&amp;rsquo;s account at another registrar to your account with iwantmyname, then the owner would unlock the domain, get the transfer auth code, remove any privacy services, and one of you (whomever has the auth code) would initiate the transfer at our website. (That is for gTLDs. As noted, the process may differ somewhat for ccTLDs.) &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184465&#34;&gt;More information on transferring TO iwantmyname here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the owner is an iwantmyname customer and you want to transfer the domain to your account at another registrar, then the owner would unlock the domain, get the transfer auth code, remove any privacy services, and one of you (whomever has the auth code) would initiate the transfer at the new registrar&amp;rsquo;s website. &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184477&#34;&gt;More information on transferring FROM iwantmyname here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the domain type and registrars involved, transfers can be immediate, or take up to 5 days to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, be sure that all payments and other arrangements have been made &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; initiating the transfer. Once a domain has been transferred, it&amp;rsquo;s likely no longer yours or accessible, and you have no way of getting it back or withholding it to demand payment if you get shafted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-7&#34;&gt;Anything else?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be the legal owner of a domain, your name and/or organization&amp;rsquo;s name needs to be in the registrant/owner contact details. This information may not automatically change when a domain is transferred. Be sure to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, you can update the registrant contacts for many types of domains in your dashboard, under &lt;em&gt;edit contacts&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re unable to do that, there may be an issue, or we may need to make the update for you, so let us know. If your domain is registered elsewhere, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to contact that registrar for help updating the details if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that changing the registrant contact details is often called an &lt;em&gt;owner change&lt;/em&gt;. For some types of domains, this change is considered by registries to be similar to a domain registration, so there may be a fee involved. Some registries also require identification and paperwork to be included. (We can help clarify this as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of millions of domains registered, there is a pretty good chance that one you want is taken already. If it&amp;rsquo;s one you really want, you may be fortunate and able to procure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, nowadays at least there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;hundreds of new TLDs&lt;/a&gt; to choose from to help you come up with just the right alternative. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The nearly foolproof three-step test for determining the quality of a website</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-15-twitter-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Twitter Logos&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Find the social icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; If the Twitter icon isn&amp;rsquo;t shaped like the birds above (angled slightly up), you&amp;rsquo;ve probably found a brand that either doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the internet or doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about details (possibly worse?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that there are levels of terribleness here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-15-twitter-logo-old.png&#34; alt=&#34;Old Twitter Logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Score -100:&lt;/strong&gt; Definitely the wrong logo, but I can see how someone could see this and not instantly think it&amp;rsquo;s wrong. If you see something like this on a personal site, politely send an email to the site owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-04-15-twitter-logo-older.png&#34; alt=&#34;Older Twitter Logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Score -4000:&lt;/strong&gt; You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant with carpet clearly from the 1980&amp;rsquo;s?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Does open source contribute to a more open society?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies say they love open source, but what does that actually mean? Does it mean they use a lot of software other people have written? Does it mean they like that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for things? Or do they understand that &lt;em&gt;loving open source&lt;/em&gt; also means contributing back to the community the code came from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start again. We at iwantmyname love open source! And when I say we love open source, I mean that we&amp;rsquo;re always trying to work and live up to its ethos—to continuously share the things we learn, and to approach challenges with facts instead of emotion. Open-source development is all about learning and developing in the open, with people we may never meet in real life—it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to any of us what we look like, who we are, what our gender is, our race, religious beliefs, or sexual preference. It&amp;rsquo;s all irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how we can work together to make projects awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having lived in this environment for many years, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to apply this same thinking to other parts of my life. With less time these days to contribute to actual code, I make efforts to talk at conferences and user groups, and, even more importantly, to grab coffee with people who ask for feedback (or are willing to give feedback) on ideas, architectures, and random happenings. The open source community I&amp;rsquo;m in has become a very real community, where the people I know can discuss, in the open, critical business-related things without fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why the trust? Well, open source also teaches ethics—to be able to work and share with a loose team of contributors. You need a level of trust to have someone you&amp;rsquo;ve never met in person contribute code to a project, and you need the right thought technology in place to create the expectation of not breaching that trust. If that trust is breached, projects get forked, communities split up, and egos clash until everyone gets back to the hard facts and finds new ways of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we not only use open source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open-source. We actively do this by working closely with local tech incubators, hosting like-minded user groups and meetups, and sponsoring innovative events like the upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensourceopensociety.com&#34;&gt;OS//OS 2015&lt;/a&gt; conference here in Wellington, which is very much aligned with our core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to be part of a brand that makes such a large impact relative to our size, and I love that we&amp;rsquo;ve been given the opportunity to be so deeply embedded in what&amp;rsquo;s going on in New Zealand and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A call to help Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-03-23-vanuatu-cyclone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vanuatu&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of us who live in temperate climates, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to imagine
the unfolding horror of a category 5 tropical cyclone bearing down on your
home with winds exceeding 200 mph. But that was the scenario facing the
inhabitants of the far flung islands of Vanuatu recently. The tiny Pacific
Ocean island archipelago took a direct hit from Cyclone Pam, resulting in
many villages being entirely flattened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredibly and thankfully, the death toll as a result of the storm has been kept to a minimum, but a large section of the population has been left without food, water, and housing. Now a major relief operation is underway involving NGOs and neighbouring governments from the South Pacific region such as New Zealand and Australia. Technology is also playing a part in the recovery with power and communications providers rallying to get services running again quickly. We have seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://pacificpolicy.org/2015/03/surviving-cyclone-pam/&#34;&gt;encouraging reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that some progress is being made, against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the first time a huge cyclone has ravaged communities in the
Pacific. Typhoon Haiyan wreaked havoc across the islands of the Philippines
in 2013. You may recall our efforts to contribute during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html&#34;&gt;Haiyan relief
operation&lt;/a&gt;. With your help, we will be financially supporting UNICEF&amp;rsquo;s operation on the ground in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu&#34;&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt; today with an immediate donation of $6,500. We are thrilled to learn that our cash will pack twice the punch because New Zealand philanthropists Gareth and Jo Morgan have agreed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unicef.org.nz/UNICEF-New-Zealand-issues-fundraising-challenge-to-reach-82000-children-in-Vanuatu&#34;&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; the first $1 million in donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname has a longstanding policy of setting aside 10 cents from every
domain registration for charitable purposes, but with the crisis being so
great, we&amp;rsquo;ve dug a bit deeper to help out our neighbours in their time of need. If you want to make your own donation to the Vanuatu relief fund, you can do so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Usability is something we should all be striving for</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://melodykramer.github.io/how-betty-who-is-89-gets-her-news/&#34;&gt;From Melody Kramer:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we drank tea, I watched Betty read articles on her iPad. Her Internet was really slow. She kept accidentally clicking on the ads, or on parts of the story that she didn’t mean to click on. And she was getting a bit frustrated and worried — that by clicking on something, she was going to install malware or not be able to return to her story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 13 million people between the ages of 75 and 84 in the US. There are 5 million between the ages of 85 and 94. (census) That population will grow. At some point, it will be composed of digital natives but that’s a while away. In the interim, are there better ways to design websites for this population? Are there better ways to design the news for them? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good web entity, we&amp;rsquo;re always planning for the next evolution of our website. Whether we like it or not, trends change, platforms that were built for one thing get weighed down by incremental additions, and new technologies emerge (like responsive design) that change how sites move through the world. Those things are always moving targets that need to be addressed, but one factor that cannot be overlooked, no matter when your design/redesign occurs, is usability. At the end of the day, the single most important thing you can offer is an easy path from idea to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example of where the internet is going. After I wrote our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/what-should-the-internet-do-with-money.html&#34;&gt;post about .money&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking through various finance websites. What I found didn&amp;rsquo;t really surprise me, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-03-11-fidelity-homepage.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fidelity homepage&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Fidelity&amp;rsquo;s homepage. As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s packed with information, but if your goal is to start an account (which, I&amp;rsquo;d argue, should be the goal in a logged-out state) , you have a lot to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-03-11-wealthfront-homepage.png&#34; alt=&#34;Wealthfront homepage&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum is Wealthfront, an investment startup that puts usability first. Big buttons. Clear calls to action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could certainly make the argument that Fidelity&amp;rsquo;s website is more immediately useful, strictly from a knowledge-density perspective, but we&amp;rsquo;re heading in a direction, as a society, where screens are rapidly shrinking in size.  Apple recently announced their new 12&amp;rdquo; Macbook, which is their most technologically advanced laptop to date (not to be confused with fastest), and the only reason the screen is as big as it is is because they didn&amp;rsquo;t want the keyboard to be any smaller. There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; come a day, and it may come faster than we think, where an iPad/phablet-type device will be the primary device for many, and then what? Will the Fidelity content-density model hold up? Are we just going to sit around while our aging population is designed off these unusable platforms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just something to think about when you&amp;rsquo;re starting your next design/redesign process.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Trustworthiness as a factor in Google rankings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530102.600-google-wants-to-rank-websites-based-on-facts-not-links.html#.VPSuQUIylBW&#34;&gt;From Hal Hodson &amp;ndash; New Scientist:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google research team is adapting that model to measure the trustworthiness of a page, rather than its reputation across the web. Instead of counting incoming links, the system – which is not yet live – counts the number of incorrect facts within a page. &amp;ldquo;A source that has few false facts is considered to be trustworthy,&amp;rdquo; says the team (arxiv.org/abs/1502.03519v1). The score they compute for each page is its Knowledge-Based Trust score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software works by tapping into the Knowledge Vault, the vast store of facts that Google has pulled off the internet. Facts the web unanimously agrees on are considered a reasonable proxy for truth. Web pages that contain contradictory information are bumped down the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much time and effort these days goes into search engine optimization (SEO), but every time I see an article like this, I see a day in the far-off future where all the &amp;ldquo;tips and tricks&amp;rdquo; will be replaced by variations of a single question—is your website helping the world or hurting it?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Leonard Nimoy&#39;s final tweet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/27/8121021/leonard-nimoy-spock-live-long-and-prosper&#34;&gt;From Bryan Bishop &amp;ndash; The Verge:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it should go without saying that the sense of someone we get from their acting and public appearances often bears little resemblance to who they actually are. But what is undeniable is the emotional impact their work has on us. And for the millions of people, like myself, that grew up with Leonard Nimoy, those are the memories that we will carry with us throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a sentiment that Nimoy himself reflected upon on Twitter this past Sunday, in his very last post. &amp;ldquo;A life is like a garden,&amp;rdquo; he wrote. &amp;ldquo;Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The simple guide to finding the right domain name for your podcast</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-20-podcast.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasts seem to be getting more and more popular by the week, with big shows and big names finally getting the mainstream media attention they deserve. But one of the best things about podcasting is that it can be done by anyone. There aren&amp;rsquo;t any expensive broadcasting rights or legal hurdles to deal with—all you have to do is get a mic, learn how to use some basic audio software (free options like Garageband are readily available), and find a reliable platform to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/&#34;&gt;host your show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing that trips up many budding podcasters is the domain name. For the same reasons naming anything is hard, naming and finding a domain name for a podcast is a tricky balance between science and intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;General naming tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Domain extensions from iTunes&amp;rsquo; US top-50 podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Alternative domain extensions for podcast websites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;General naming tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into top-level domains (TLDs), let&amp;rsquo;s dive into some basic naming tips for your podcast. Here are a few rules to live by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to pick a name that&amp;rsquo;s too long or too hard to spell. The last thing you want is for your show to be hard to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to name your brand something that could be confused with a bigger, more well-known brand. A quick check is to type the name in Google—if you find a brand with an entire page full of search content, you&amp;rsquo;ll be fighting an uphill battle (not to mention potential legal issues).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your show begins with &amp;ldquo;The&amp;rdquo;, it may be wise to get two domains—one with &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; and one without. For example, if your show is The Domain Podcast, try registering thedomainpodcast.com and domainpodcast.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-letter characters like dashes and numbers are fairly rare online, and may confuse people trying to find your show. Only use them when it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Domain extensions from iTunes&#39; US top-50 podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Excluding shows that don&amp;rsquo;t have their own sites due to being on larger networks, like Invisibilia with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/.&#34;&gt;http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; freakonomics.com, missedinhistory.com, stuffyoushouldknow.com, lightroomkillertips.com, wtfpod.com, dancarlin.com, commonplacebooks.com, thisiscriminal.com, fourhourworkweek.com, daveramsey.com, nerdist.com, thetruthpodcast.com, smartpassiveincome.com, adamcarolla.com, sciencefriday.com, billburr.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&#34;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; serialpodcast.org, thisamericanlife.org, radiolab.org, themoth.org, howtodoeverything.org, 99percentinvisible.org, onbeing.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&#34;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; podcasts.joerogan.net, startalkradio.net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&#34;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; howtostartastartup.co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&#34;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; everydayfinance.info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about podcasts is that although they&amp;rsquo;re seen as a fairly new phenomenon, they&amp;rsquo;ve been around for quite some time now, and many of the most popular shows are linked to either &amp;ldquo;old-school media&amp;rdquo; (NPR/various TV networks) or sites that represent established non-podcast entities (like Freakonomics Radio, which started as a book, and The Moth, which organizes live storytelling events). Given the abundance of pre-internet roots, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me to see so many .COMs, .ORGs, and .NETs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like the rest of the internet, good names in these domain extensions are increasingly hard to come by. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some alternative domain extensions, here are some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Alternative domain extensions for podcast websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-audio&#34;&gt;.audio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-community&#34;&gt;.community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-digital&#34;&gt;.digital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-expert&#34;&gt;.expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-media&#34;&gt;.media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&#34;&gt;.press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-report&#34;&gt;.report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&#34;&gt;.today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-radio&#34;&gt;.radio&lt;/a&gt; (launch date TBD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&#34;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt; (popularly used by Overcast, one of the more popular podcast players for the iPhone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&#34;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; (still a very popular extension for startups and tech projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to use descriptive extensions for your brand. Here are some industry specific top-level domains (TLDs) that could work quite well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-academy&#34;&gt;.academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&#34;&gt;.beer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-build&#34;&gt;.build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-business&#34;&gt;.business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&#34;&gt;.club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&#34;&gt;.coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-events&#34;&gt;.events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-futbol&#34;&gt;.futbol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-hiphop&#34;&gt;.hiphop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-reviews&#34;&gt;.reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-reviews&#34;&gt;.tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-zone&#34;&gt;.zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) open up such a huge world of naming options for everyone. If you find one you like, use it! Just remember that podcast discovery is unlike typical website discovery. If your show is good, fans will probably find your podcast on platforms like iTunes or Stitcher first, then attempt to find your website later after hearing a few episodes. Given that discovery path, your biggest concern should be how sticky your domain sounds when you inevitably say it at the end of each episode. Before you register a domain, say it out loud to a few of your friends—if it sounds awkward, long, or tricky to spell, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to lose traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you ever get stuck, try a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza&#34;&gt;.pizza&lt;/a&gt; domain. Nine out of ten scientists agree that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to forget domains that end in .pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>It takes two to make a thing go right - setting up a website with your domain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually getting your own website with your own domain name online can be a bit like exploring a foreign land. Navigating uncharted territory, trying to decipher unfamiliar language. Creating a web presence is not for the weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we&amp;rsquo;ve put a lot of work into trying to make that process as painless as possible. And now, with designer &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/say-hi-to-the-newest-iwantmynamer-kevin-layshock.html&#34;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; on board, we&amp;rsquo;re hoping to make even greater strides in user experience friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing some people still sometimes struggle with, though, is just how to get a website up and running. If only it all happened by magic as soon as your domain was registered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding web hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, you can think of the process a bit like setting up a piece of electronics equipment. The cable needs to be plugged into the machine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; into an electrical outlet. Your domain name needs to be connected to a web platform in our system &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in the system of your hosting service platform. When setting up your website, you can do these steps in whatever order you choose. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All websites need a host, somewhere to &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo;. Think of your domain name as the address of your house, and the hosting as the actual house the address refers to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we focus on domains and DNS management, so we don&amp;rsquo;t offer hosting. However, we want it to be as easy as possible for you to set up hosting with whatever provider you choose. That can be done a couple of different ways, depending on your hosting choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your site with a service platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-03-apps.png&#34; alt=&#34;Apps&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sign up with a service that provides a platform: this includes web hosting &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the software to create and display your website and its contents. Examples of this include Squarespace, Big Cartel, Zenfolio, or Tumblr. In those cases, you have an account with the service, and set up and make changes to your website in that account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those platforms make it incredibly easy to set up great-looking sites with little technical know-how. Click on preferred colours, drag and drop how you want things to look, and you&amp;rsquo;re all set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you pay just to have an account, sometimes the services are free. Or they can be free for a basic account, and then you pay to scale up the features and flexibility: a &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo; account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the services in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;our one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt; are that kind. They provide the hosting and platform for your blog, portfolio, online store, etc. Clicking that green &lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; button adds DNS records for your domain in your iwantmyname dashboard. Those DNS records connect your domain name to your account and site with the service platform. That&amp;rsquo;s half the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Verifying your domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some services require you to verify your domain ownership in their system for security purposes. In those cases you&amp;rsquo;ll likely have to add another DNS record that contains a unique code, which the service checks for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the code from the other service (Squarespace and Google Apps are good examples) and add a CNAME or or TXT record containing the code, then save the new settings. Where we can, we ask you for that code in our one-click setup, and add that extra record for you. The screenshot below shows the one-click setup for Squarespace. (You can see an example of instructions on how to get the verification code &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.squarespace.com/guides/domain-mapping-with-iwantmyname&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-03-squarespace-verification.png&#34; alt=&#34;Squarespace verification&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the settings have some time to propagate around the Internet (a few hours is plenty of time, usually), you can verify ownership in your account with the platform service. Often you can do this by just entering your domain name in your account there and clicking a button. These services generally have excellent documentation to explain where and how to complete that. But if you have questions, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re happy to help, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verification is often the biggest part of setting up your domain with the other service. When verification isn&amp;rsquo;t needed, it&amp;rsquo;s often as simple as logging in to your account on that platform, adding your domain name in your account, and saving the new settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where possible, when you finish setting up the DNS records you need in our system, we try to send you to the other site to complete the setup there, too. Once setup is done on both ends and the new settings have time to propagate around the Internet — voila! — you have your new website! (If there&amp;rsquo;s a snag, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re here to help&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up your site with third-party hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web hosting can also be provided by a third-party hosting service, on which your website&amp;rsquo;s files reside. Those services generally only provide hosting, and not the software to create your website or email accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&#34;&gt;Our recommended hosting partners are Bluehost and Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, which provide only the hosting. Then you can use whatever software and services you like. WordPress is also a popular option, though it provides both the hosting and the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use external web hosting, you connect your domain to the hosting account by adding their nameservers in your iwantmyname dashboard. Using external nameservers is kind of like having your mail forwarded after you move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-03-nameserver-options.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nameservers&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your iwantmyname account dashboard, on the nameserver update page, there&amp;rsquo;s a drop-down list of many popular hosting providers. Clicking on the one with which you have an account will automatically fill in their nameservers. Then you just have to save the new settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can get the nameservers from your hosting company (or set up your own, if you&amp;rsquo;re techy) and add them. They often look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns1.domainhosting.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ns2.domainhosting.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use external web hosting, there is one important thing to remember, which is that you then have to set up any DNS records in your web hosting account, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in your iwantmyname account. Our DNS management dashboard can only work when our nameservers are in place. If there&amp;rsquo;s any trouble with the DNS records, we can&amp;rsquo;t access or see them in your hosting account, so you&amp;rsquo;d need to ask your hosting provider for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting up your website with a domain name you have registered with us, you will only have to set things up in one of these two ways: either adding DNS records to a service platform, or updating nameservers for an external web hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to set up more than one service platform in your iwantmyname account. For example, if you would like to set up a website and email accounts. Or have an online store and a blog. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;Feel free to get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions about how to do any of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Meet the domain extensions of February, including .work, .delivery, and .yoga</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-02-02-business.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;work&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches have gotten off to a bit of a slow start in 2015, but the overall stats are looking more impressive by the day. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ntldstats.com&#34;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are now 4,121,213 new gTLDs registered (a nearly 400,000 jump from Jan 1), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;so many options to choose from&lt;/a&gt;—there&amp;rsquo;s literally never been a better time than today to get a unique domain with your brand name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, we have eight new domain extensions, including .yoga, .work, and .energy. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to predict individual TLD popularity because of the abundant options available, but some industry specific options (like .delivery for home delivery startups) have done pretty well in niche markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-casa&#34;&gt;.casa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-work&#34;&gt;.work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Why does iwantmyname need a monthly newsletter?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a challenge. Digital startups today are looking to capture global audiences with smaller staffs, more competition, and leaner margins than the analog brands of yore. For example, here at iwantmyname, our current marketing/communications goal is to reach the entirety of the English-speaking world (and beyond) with 11 people and no giant marketing budget speak of. Basically, we&amp;rsquo;ve almost exclusively leveraged word-of-mouth to reach customers/visitors in 234 countries (Google Analytics even says we got a visit from N. Korea?)&amp;hellip;something we&amp;rsquo;re extremely proud of, but it&amp;rsquo;s a constant grind to spread our message of simplicity even further—in a sincere way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sincerity in brand messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m just a naive between-Millennial-and-Gen-Xer (Xennial?), but I often look at advertising as an insincere gesture. When I see display ads, I often think of them as giant billboards trying to subliminally make me like things (I don’t like you, but that cheeseburger looks delicious!). Social marketing is often the same—companies tweet mildly funny tidbits to their followers, hoping for some sort of delightful, friendly response. If their posts were personal notes or direct messages, they’d be charming, but it’s hard to be charmed by a message directed at no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just so much noise. 10 tweets a day from each brand, three Facebook posts, display ads, news articles, sponsorships, appearances. As a consumer, I’m not looking for radio silence, I’m just yearning for a way to turn it off most of the week. I like to see innovation and ideas and compatible company cultures, but I don’t have the time or mental capacity to keep up with fifteen brands shouting at me everywhere I go. None of us do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as an iwantmyname brand ambassador, I feel like the responsible thing to do is to help create a way to deliver our thoughts and innovations without filling people&amp;rsquo;s lives with even more noise—to compress all the clutter into one manageable chunk. In 2015, I really think this is the best way to follow brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sign up for the monthly newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most days we (along with so many other brands) publish blog posts, then do some connecting social posts—but it would be crazy to expect anyone to pay attention on a daily basis. If you follow the iwantmyname blog daily, as my mom would say, bless your heart. But let’s be honest…if you’re not a keeping up with the industry on a professional or semi-professional basis, you shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be thinking about domains all the time. We designed iwantmyname to be the simplest domain registrar on the internet because we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; want people to have to regularly think about our end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have some interesting ideas though, and we regularly highlight features and give suggestions that can make lives easier. For example, if you’re looking to host a podcast, we recently added &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast&#34;&gt;Simplecast&lt;/a&gt; to our available plugins. It’s a really neat platform—something we think you should know about. And we often post about new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; coming out, which could inspire you to start the next great website. We’re also pretty big on startup culture, so we often write about new tools and thought technologies we find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want some more of the above, or if you just want to know if our brand aligns with your ideals and priorities, the best/least-intrusive option is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&#34;&gt;sign up for our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, it’s yet another thing  to sign up for, but in a way it sets you free. After you sign up, you can be certain we’ll deliver you our latest thoughts in one easily deletable email (seriously, one click and it’s gone), and after that, you can go back to thinking about whatever it is you should be thinking about—like your job, your family, or your hobby du jour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, for more instant coverage, our social platforms (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;) work great. Our general social strategy is to only spread thoughts—and very few good thoughts can be condensed to 140 characters—so 1-3 times a day we post links to blogs we’ve written, plus the occasional update, and that’s about it. If you see something you find interesting, click on it, but if you don’t, don&amp;rsquo;t sweat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stats also seem to support a monthly newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine it’s pretty clear by now that I prefer newsletters as the content driver for most brands, but the stats seem to support that thinking as well. If you’ve been an iwantmyname customer for a while, you’ve probably seen the yearly newsletter we send to remind people of our existence (we send it to every customer). Here are some stats from the end-of-2014 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent to 99,960 mailboxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29.2% open rate (vs. the 14.7 industry average, according to MailChimp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most clicked items were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the link to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&#34;&gt;new monthly newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&#34;&gt;December domain discounts&lt;/a&gt;, which tells me that a lot of the people interested in domain discounts aren’t regularly visiting our blog or site—which is perfectly understandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/a/ideegeo.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform&#34;&gt;link to help&lt;/a&gt; with the iwantmyname API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for certain that this is common for newsletters, but the analytics for this particular send seems to support the thinking that our customers would like a monthly edition, and that there are certain topics and tidbits people would like delivered to them on a semi-regular basis. That alone is reason enough to publish a monthly edition, so everything extra is gravy, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TLDR?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need monthly newsletters because people tend to appreciate news and ideas presented in unobtrusive, easily deletable packages. Brands are unique in that they have a ton of combined knowledge to share, but (I’m serious about this) customers shouldn’t have to spend more than 30 minutes a month to keep up with their latest thought technologies. If you want to follow a brand&amp;rsquo;s blogs and social posts, that’s awesome, but you shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you’d like to hear more from us (unobtrusively), be sure to subscribe to our new monthly newsletter, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&#34;&gt;iwantmyname:Monthly&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be sending our first edition later on this week, and we think you’ll really like it (and if you don’t, just unsubscribe…&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB5ceAruYrI&#34;&gt;hakuna matata&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Start naming your brands and domains like a pro</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Naming and choosing domains often go hand-in-hand, but many don&amp;rsquo;t take either as seriously as they probably should. To get a glimpse of the professional naming process, take a gander at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/the-weird-science-of-naming-new-products.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Weird Science of Naming New Products&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Neal Gabler of the New York Times Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to do everything — to leave no word unturned. He visits the website onelook.com, which shows how words work with other words, or sketchengine.co.uk, which combs texts and concordances, flags parts of speech and shows how a specific word appears in billions of words of text. He visits rhymezone.com to find all the words that rhyme with a word. That is how he came up with the name for an ideation application for the Palm Pilot — he began with “brain,” looked for rhyming words and concluded with BrainForest. For this project, he thought of words about travel, but also about entertainment, the sense of engagement, connection, energy, even spheres. And he laid them all out on an Excel spreadsheet — 1,200 names in all by the time he had finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a single project, namers can come up with as many as 6,500 names. Big naming companies will do anywhere from 40 to 50 projects a year, and smaller ones 15 to 20, which adds up to a lot of names. Of course, only one name will be chosen for each project, and that is the only one the client will own. The rest, however, won’t necessarily go to waste. Every naming agency keeps a list of its discards in a computer program. These are then classified by message (at Catchword); by distinctiveness, appeal, memorability and concept (at Interbrand); or by whatever other way the namers might want to retrieve them. Catchword has 650 of these categorized lists. And many of the names will be recycled, which suggests that there is a kind of Platonic ideal of good names, independent of products good or bad — a name so good that it could work, if not on anything, than at least on many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now clearly many (if not most) people/brands can&amp;rsquo;t afford the premium costs of naming firms, but we should all strive to dig a bit deeper into our brands and ideals before coming up with names (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have at least 100 ideas on paper, you&amp;rsquo;re probably not trying hard enough). Just another something to add to your 2015 resolutions list.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Things to know about domains before buying your first domain name</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never more apparent how puzzling domain names are to people than when I get asked about my job. “A domain registrar? What the heck is that?” I get it all the time, but what surprises me most is that many of these same people already own domains in some form or another—usually brokered through legacy web-design firms charging $20-30/mo for Flash websites with glitzy visitor counters (seriously, if you&amp;rsquo;re paying $30/mo for a site built a decade ago, you&amp;rsquo;re getting ripped off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my goal of goals is to set them on the right path, usually with an abridged version of this very post—my spiel on domain names, what you’re buying, what the deal is with all the new domain extensions, what email has to do with it all, and a bit about Whois privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Domain name? Domain registrar?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Domain extensions, or top-level domains (TLDs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;The new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;What to do with your domain name?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;A final word about privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;And please, don’t be shy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;1. Domain name? Domain registrar?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to get in the right frame of mind, let&amp;rsquo;s think of the internet at an entirely new planet Earth. Then, think of the domain extensions (like .com, ,net, .edu) as countries, and the individual domain names (like iwantmyname.com or yourname.com) as pieces of property within those countries. Then, as your domain registrar, iwantmyname is like a big real estate agency, able to sell you a piece of property in a ton of countries on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internet is a huge planet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain extensions are countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual domain names are property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain registrars are your real estate agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the writer of this, I’m your content guide to internet real estate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;2. Domain extensions, or top-level domains (TLDs)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginnings of the public internet, the web was filled with a fairly limited number of domain extensions (also called top-level domains (or TLDs)). In the US, most websites ended in .com, .net, .org, .edu, or .gov, and around the world, many sites adopted their country code top-level domains (or ccTLDs)—like .co.uk in the UK and .co.nz in New Zealand. No matter where you were though, .com was the clear popularity leader, and that popularity advantage still exists today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, .com is like a country, and like any country, there’s limited desirable space. And limited desirable space always leads to overcrowding. The problem is twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With more and more people getting on the internet, we’re starting to run out of short, memorable domain names. And by run out, I mean that by 2014, every two, three, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html&#34;&gt;four letter .com domain had already been registered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not like all these domains are being used though. Basic rules of supply and demand brought countless opportunistic businessmen who bought up these domains and started selling them on the domain aftermarket for premium prices (some even went in the million-dollar range!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people blame these so-called cybersquatters for the lack of good .com names available, but it’s hard to blame them for wanting to be part of the action (do you blame real-estate speculators for the lack of cheap property in your area?). Just remember that this supply/demand issue is based on the fact that the only desirable TLD is .com, which was borderline true in years past. If the amount of good options multiply through&amp;hellip;what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;3. The new gTLDs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the details and backstory, but in 2014, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;hundreds upon hundreds of new domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; were created (often called the new generic TLDs (gTLDs), or new TLDs (nTLDs)), making that lack of quality domain names a thing of the past. Now, if I want to use my name in a domain, I can get Chris.ninja, Chris.club, Chris.cool, Chris.enterprises, Chris.vodka, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I hinted at already, the problem we’re running into now isn’t a supply issue, it’s a human nature issue—people are afraid of the unknown. Sticking with the property analogy, if you open a shiny new store in a brand new place, will people find it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all depends on how you’re being discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If social media is your biggest traffic driver, your links will work fine no matter what your TLD is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on who you ask, there might actually be a small search engine optimization (SEO) advantage to using a new gTLD (but maybe none at all). As long as your brand is good and your copy isn’t spammy, your search engine results should be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only potential harm is if people think your domain looks like a scam because of your TLD. There&amp;rsquo;s a fairly small (in the scheme of things) history of spam websites buying up domain names similar to real brand names on various TLDs, but as long as your brand doesn&amp;rsquo;t include fake looking strings of numbers, random characters (usually lots of dashes), or fishy misspellings, you should be fine. As more and more big/legitimate websites adopt these new domain extensions, that stigma should go away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of articles online that have research “proving” either side of the discoverability debate (whether the new gTLDs are good or bad for business), but my stance is that there are too many people with too much money invested into these new gTLDs for them to completely fail. Maybe none of them will reach the popularity of .com, but people’s attitude towards domains that don’t end in .com is definitely starting to shift. My best advice would be to worry about the name of your brand first, then find an applicable TLD to fit it. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;hundreds to choose from&lt;/a&gt; now, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to be bound to the crowded land of .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;4. What to do with your domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve established that domain names are property—what kinds of things can you build on it? Let’s run through a couple options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Build a website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common thing to do with a domain name is to build a website. And unless you’re deft at writing code (if so, you probably don’t need to be reading this), the best course of action is to use one of the many platforms available to build your site with ease (many have templates or some form of drag-and-drop tools available, making web design easy enough for everyone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the gist. On one end, you have your domain name, and on the other, you have a website built on a platform like Squarespace. To get your Squarespace site to pair with your domain, you have to add the correct DNS records to your domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at iwantmyname, we make that part easy. Once you buy your domain, you can set it up to work with many of the web’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/ecommerce-hosting/&#34;&gt;most popular platforms&lt;/a&gt; with just a few clicks. So instead of worrying about editing DNS records, you can get started with a platform like Squarespace, Shopify, Tumblr, or Ghost in a snap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously&amp;hellip; it’s almost automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A quick word about www.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while we get asked how much it costs to add the www. to a website. It’s totally free—the www. is just a subdomain that isn’t necessary, but still common because people got used to saying it in the 90’s. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&#34;&gt;platform setups&lt;/a&gt; add the www. option automatically, so there’s no need to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Get an email address&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we get asked most is how to get a custom email address. So first, let’s be clear about how your domain name fits into your email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at an email address, it usually looks something like this—chris@yourname.com. To create this, the owner of yourname.com had to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the yourname.com domain name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select and sign up for an &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&#34;&gt;email hosting service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point the domain name to that email hosting service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add individual email addresses (like chris@yourname.com) through the email hosting service admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like anything on the web, there are a lot of different companies out there that do email hosting—Google, Fastmail, Zoho, etc. All of them will be able to get your mail from point A to point B, but they all offer slightly different features at different price points. My suggestion would be to head to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&#34;&gt;email plugin page&lt;/a&gt;, then look at each platform’s website to see which features you’d be happiest with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sometimes you just need to wait for inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some people, getting a domain means there&amp;rsquo;s an immediate plan. For others, it’s important to wait for inspiration to strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens to me all the time. I’ll be driving home from lunch, thinking about how to best tell people about my awesome dining experience, then decide to create a restaurant review website. After an hour or so of quick naming exercises, I’ll grab a domain to kickstart the writing process (kind of like buying a guitar to guilt yourself into learning how to play). But sometimes, if I lose interest too fast, I’ll sit on the domain for a month or two while the ideas percolate—once you register a domain, it’s yours for a year, so there’s no big rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that if you don’t decide to use the domain, be sure to turn renewals off so you won’t keep paying for it year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;5. A final word about privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online privacy has been all over the news lately (for good reason), and one of the easier things you can do to hide some of your information is to enable Whois privacy (it’s free) on your domain. &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425-do-you-offer-a-whois-privacy-service-&#34;&gt;Here’s a good guide&lt;/a&gt; to how Whois privacy works and how to enable it, but please note that only the domain extensions listed in that article support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;6. And please, don’t be shy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, the internet can be a big, scary place. If you ever run into any issues with your domain, or just can’t figure out how to link it to the platform you want, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;send us a message&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll be sure to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SEO penalties of moving our blog to a subdomain</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start this article by confessing that we’re not SEO gurus at iwantmyname. Everything we&amp;rsquo;ve done in the last few years in terms of SEO was done with a basic understanding of the topic and by providing a good product with relevant content and landing pages. This always served us well and we were happy with our rankings overall. With that out of the way, I’d like to tell you about our experience with switching our blog to a subdomain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning of July last year, we moved our blog from a subdirectory URL (&lt;code&gt;iwantmyname.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;) to a subdomain (&lt;code&gt;blog.iwantmyname.com&lt;/code&gt;) for better maintainability and performance with GitHub Pages&amp;rsquo; &lt;abbr title=&#34;content delivery network&#34;&gt;CDN&lt;/abbr&gt; and future-proofing in case we wanted to switch to a different platform down the road. We made this decision after doing lots of research and had long discussions about how it might impact our search engine rankings, but we ultimately agreed to make the change. After all, it was 2014 and Google should be clever enough that it wouldn’t make any difference because they know the blog (subdomain or not) is part of iwantmyname, right? As Matt Cutts said &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MswMYk05tk&#34;&gt;in one of his webmaster videos&lt;/a&gt; “it’s a question which one is easier for you and whichever one makes you happier I would go and do it that way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we expected an initial hit after making the subdomain switch and traffic slowly recovering, the turnaround didn’t happen after 6 months, as you can see in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-01-16-blog-traffic-subdomain-switch.png&#34; alt=&#34;Blog traffic after switch to subdomain&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what we can tell, we did everything by the books with &lt;code&gt;301&lt;/code&gt; redirects for all URLs - so what happened? Could it have been just coincidence that Google updated their algorithm and we got penalized for some reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One signal that Google introduced one month after us making the switch was to give SSL-secured sites a little ranking boost. Since &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/iwantmyname/blog&#34;&gt;our blog is running on GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156&#34;&gt;doesn’t currently support HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;, could that have prevented the traffic from recovering? Certainly it can’t be that much of a ranking signal—although they mentioned it would increase in importance over time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after waiting for six months, we reverted the change and switched our blog back to the previous &lt;code&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. It’s still hosted on GitHub Pages and we’re using a simple Nginx proxy to show the content under &lt;code&gt;iwantmyname.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;location = /blog {
  # GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t redirect this properly, so we&#39;ll handle it
  return 301 /blog/;
}

# ^~ to allow /blog/ to match before our other regex locations
location ^~ /blog/ {
  proxy_pass https://iwantmyname.github.io;
  proxy_intercept_errors on;
  # serve custom 404 page from our blog repo instead of GitHub Pages&#39; 404
  error_page  404  /blog/404.html;
  # allow GitHub to pass caching headers instead of using our own
  expires off;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An important side effect is that our blog pages are now secured under our primary SSL certificate again.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this experience and the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://moz.com/community/q/moz-s-official-stance-on-subdomain-vs-subfolder-does-it-need-updating#reply_217479&#34;&gt;recommendation from Moz’s Rand Fishkin&lt;/a&gt;, we decided it would be better for our long-term SEO strategy to put our blog back on our primary domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would still strongly urge folks to keep all content on a single subdomain. We recently were able to test this using a subdomain on Moz itself (when moving our beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide to SEO from guides.moz.com to the current URL &lt;a href=&#34;http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo&#34;&gt;http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo&lt;/a&gt;). The results were astounding &amp;ndash; rankings rose dramatically across the board for every keyword we tracked to the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will certainly keep a close eye on traffic for the next few months and keep you updated. Hope this helps some of you when deciding on the age-old debate of whether you should have your blog on a subdomain or not!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Doing is almost always more important than worrying</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/&#34;&gt;From The Name Inspector:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Name Inspector has been reflecting on last year’s startup names while sipping on what’s left of the apple peel bourbon he made for the holidays. He’s got to say, it seems like some of these companies were named by people who sipped lots of bourbon. Here are some weird names of startups in CrunchBase that were founded in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when Nirvana (the band) first started getting played on the radio. Most of my friends were really into the music, but all I could think was “I’m pretty sure I have what it takes to sing incomprehensible lyrics, too! I’m definitely going to be a rock star.” And sure, naming your brand is a whole lot different than singing songs, but the message is similar—extreme talent aside, Nirvana was a success because they actually made music. I wasn’t because I was too worried about everything to ever get on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say, and what a lot of the startups mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/&#34;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; prove, is that you shouldn’t let branding uncertainty (or even wackiness) prevent you from doing what you want to do. Sure, maybe you think it’s a mistake to name a brand &lt;em&gt;AssessUp&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;KeeeWeee&lt;/em&gt;, but look at all these brands. They exist&amp;hellip;they’re real companies with profiles on CrunchBase! You just never know what might become the next big household brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, that same thought process also works for domain extensions. I talk to people all the time who spend a lot of energy worrying about not getting the perfect .com, but the world is changing, and people’s comfort level with “strange” non-.com’s is growing by the day. If what you’re creating is good, people will find you wherever you’re at—.io, .co, your local country code top-level domain (ccTLD), or any of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; on the market. Just go with the domain that fits your brand best—the rest will often work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dear internet, it’s time to fix your footer (again)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few certainties in life—death, taxes, the fact that eggs always taste better with a dash of hot sauce, and that on January 1st, the little numbers in the year will change ever so slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-internet, this wasn’t such a big deal. Sure, you might write the wrong year on a check or document, but it wasn’t an error the world would have to see on a daily basis. Not like on a website, where nearly all the footers in existence—the big footers, small footers, dark footers, and light footers—share one tiny trait. © 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “nearly” because every year there are those who forget to manually change the year from one to the next. It’s a bit of a minor tragedy, but entirely understandable. Fortunately, Mikko Järvenpää has your back, with a clever site called &lt;a href=&#34;http://updateyourfooter.com&#34;&gt;updateyourfooter.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever looked at a website and wondered if it is still in operation? Maybe a thing or two looked like they could have been updated – and then you notice the copyright notice the in the footer. &amp;ldquo;2012. Right, this site must be dead. Let&amp;rsquo;s move along.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it could be that the owner just forgot to update the year in the footer. That happens a lot, especially if those years are hard-coded strings. To future-proof your footer, it&amp;rsquo;s better to just let computers take care of this. Grab one of these snippets and paste that on your page (or forward this site as a friendly reminder to someone who can do it for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before the new year hits, grab a snippet for your site and leave your worries behind. Hakuna matata.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>&#34;Holiday cheer, some news items, and a bit of relaxation&#34;</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The holidays are upon us, and we’d like to thank you all for making 2014 so great. In the last year, we upped our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; size to ten, passed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/celebrating-100000-domains-at-iwantmyname.html&#34;&gt;100,000 domains registered&lt;/a&gt; mark (and beyond), added more than &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;250 new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) to the list, and managed to keep our &lt;a href=&#34;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&#34;&gt;support satisfaction at 97%&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really been incredible—so thank you, thank you, thank you. We can’t say it enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting January 2015, we’re launching our monthly newsletter. In it, we’ll include all our domain sales, new gTLD launches, important news, and interesting tidbits to make your month a little better. Here’s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/monthly&#34;&gt;signup page&lt;/a&gt;—we really think you’ll enjoy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE&#34;&gt;Developers, developers, developers!&lt;/a&gt; 2015 will be a big year for our API, and we’d love to hear &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/12/api-survey.html&#34;&gt;your thoughts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speaking of support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a note. With Christmas here and New Year’s coming up, support may be a little slower (but no less thorough) than our usual standard. Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;Support Center&lt;/a&gt; is stocked with answers to a bunch of questions though, so be sure to check there first if you’re running into any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; sweet as. And happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New feature alert—we now support USD, NZD, AUD, GBP and EUR!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-10-14-multicurrency.png&#34; alt=&#34;Multicurrency&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname website&lt;/a&gt; lately, you might&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a change in parts of the site—a new multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices (and accepting payments) in only USD (US Dollar), you can switch currencies to NZD (New Zealand Dollar), GBP (British Pound), AUD (Australian Dollar), and EUR (Euro). It&amp;rsquo;s a small feature, but one we&amp;rsquo;re really happy to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Little Backstory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we&amp;rsquo;re a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we&amp;rsquo;ve officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we&amp;rsquo;re really happy with how it&amp;rsquo;s working (being based in New Zealand, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to pay in NZD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currency: in the footer (see screenshot below), on all our price lists (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;), and in your account payment settings. We&amp;rsquo;ve also set it up to be location aware, so new customers should automatically be assigned to their correct currency. Once switched, all prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-10-14-nzd.png&#34; alt=&#34;NZD&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have any questions about multicurrency, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;feel free to ask&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The photography domain extension showdown</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a booming suburb of sorts, and one of my most vivid memories (you can&amp;rsquo;t choose what sticks!) was of a strange clump of business-centric hotels that popped up just off the freeway near my house. Even to a grade-schooler, the likelihood of all these rooms filling up on a given weekend was extremely low, yet the construction marched on. Knowing the basics of supply and demand, I was baffled, so I asked my dad to explain the logic. He said, &amp;ldquo;Well&amp;hellip; it looks like all the market researchers saw the same opportunity at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned since then is that competition is good, but unless the demand is huge, some of the players will inevitably lose out. So here I am, looking at a handful of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) related to photography, wondering A. why the world needs five extensions for the same purpose, and B. which one(s) will rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; question will have to be for a later post, but predicting popularity is a thought exercise I can get behind. So let&amp;rsquo;s lay out the contenders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&#34;&gt;.photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photos&#34;&gt;.photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&#34;&gt;.pics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pictures&#34;&gt;.pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Current Stats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current popularity isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily indicative of future success, but it is a good place to start. Here are the total registration stats (up to the time of writing) according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com&#34;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.photography &amp;ndash; 49,651&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.photos &amp;ndash; 16,820&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.photo &amp;ndash; 11,988&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.pics &amp;ndash; 6,017&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.pictures &amp;ndash; 4,241&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.Photography is clearly in the lead, but the gTLD program is still in its first year, so there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of time for the other extensions to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keyword Planner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend for a bit that I&amp;rsquo;m a picture-taker looking for maximum exposure. Like many people trying to brand themselves, I want my brand to be Chris Hall [INSERT PHOTO TLD], which would give me chrishall.TLD. Using Google&amp;rsquo;s Keyword Planner, here are the worldwide search stats for each of the gTLDs as keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photography &amp;ndash; 368,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photos &amp;ndash; 450,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;photo &amp;ndash; 823,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pics &amp;ndash; 201,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pictures &amp;ndash; 673,000 monthly searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo wins this battle by a longshot, but keep in mind that this would be for a worldwide audience. If you&amp;rsquo;re just doing photography in the US, you&amp;rsquo;d want to modify the search for that audience (pictures is the winner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .photo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind though that search volume isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily your friend. My general rule of thumb is that the more popular a search term, the more established the brands will be trying to rank for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a guy who&amp;rsquo;s more than willing to pay for a better, more fulfilling experience (I&amp;rsquo;ll take a craft brew over a big-box bottle any day), but when all things are equal, I do glance at prices. Fortunately, all the TLDs on this list are in the same basic price range, but there&amp;rsquo;s still a winner and loser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .pictures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminated: .photo (.photo costs more than .photos, and given how similar they are, it&amp;rsquo;d be hard not to go with the less expensive option)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;General Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One naming test I like to use is the confusion test. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: If you have a .co domain name, how many people are going to accidentally type in .com? I can&amp;rsquo;t speak for others, but it drives me nuts when I type in a domain and get thrown off by the domain extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with the new gTLDs, I&amp;rsquo;m to a point where I don&amp;rsquo;t instantly type in .com—but I still get thrown off by extensions that are too similar. And in this group, the fact that .photo and .photos are just one letter apart really stresses me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminated: .photos (I already eliminated .photo)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Length&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manually typing out domain names is probably pretty rare these days, but shorter names (and extensions) have quite a few benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less spelling errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generally easier to say&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less space needed on a sign or business card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .pics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, the kiddos aren&amp;rsquo;t typing out full words anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Specificity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people ask for my opinion on the matter, I tend to put aside all the SEO and just go with specificity—what works best for your brand? If you&amp;rsquo;re a photographer, I&amp;rsquo;d go with .photography. If you&amp;rsquo;re not a photographer, things get a little muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER: .photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the other gTLDs on the list, there seems to be one that&amp;rsquo;s not like the others—.pictures. I happen to like .pictures as a TLD, but if someone told me their domain ended with .pictures, I might wonder if they&amp;rsquo;re a photographer or an illustrator (maybe they draw their pictures?). For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m bailing on .pictures as a winning option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminated: .pictures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for definitive, scientifically proven answers, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. Truth be told, if you&amp;rsquo;re a good photographer (or a bad one with lots of fans), it probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which TLD you use. But, for argument&amp;rsquo;s sake, here are my winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER (photographers): .photography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographers do photography. They don&amp;rsquo;t just create pictures, they create art—so be proud of your calling and go with the corresponding gTLD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER (non-photographers): .pics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not a photographer, you might as well eliminate all the fluff. Cut the letters, bypass the excess search competition, and go with .pics.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Is it still worthwhile to have keywords in domains?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.canirank.com/blog/keyword-domains/?session=22f69924c5835d1f302e33d3a4529b55&#34;&gt;From the Can I Rank blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyword domain names were once thought of as a golden ticket to top rankings, but the general consensus in the SEO community seems to be that their power has diminished in the wake of Google’s Exact Match Domain update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, if any, role do keyword domains play in SEO today? Is it still worth spending tens of thousands of dollars for a category-defining domain name if it’s not an automatic ticket the front of the line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we want to examine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are keyword domain names still beneficial?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much do they help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do they help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is that help worth, in dollar terms?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever gone through the process of naming a website, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably struggled with this very issue—is it better for business to have your domain name stick to a brand (dominos.com) or a keyword (dominos&lt;strong&gt;pizza&lt;/strong&gt;.com)? I&amp;rsquo;d be the first to tell you not to worry about it—the quality of your product will eventually trump optimization in rankings—but my cavalier mentality might be getting in the way of a very real SEO benefit. Especially if your website is solely focused on a single topic or product.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Giving back in 2015—Karuna Bali and IDEP</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving back has always been part of the culture at iwantmyname—from &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html&#34;&gt;hands-on teaching overseas &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/lightning-strikes-twice-in-wellingtons-startup-scene.html&#34;&gt;supporting our local tech startup scene&lt;/a&gt;—but on our 5th birthday we decided to do something a little more permanent. Given that there are only ten of us, our plan of action was to help fund &lt;a href=&#34;http://charitynavigator.org/&#34;&gt;highly efficient aid initiatives&lt;/a&gt; that could do so much more for people around the world than we ever could on our own. Our pledge was to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&#34;&gt;10 cents from each domain registered&lt;/a&gt; to a charity of our choosing, and our first recipient was Save the Children, who was working hard at the time to help the Philippines recover from Typhoon Haiyan (and they&amp;rsquo;re back on the ground now to help with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6150549/&#34;&gt;Typhoon Hagupit&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, our plan is to support local initiatives in Bali, an island that was very hospitable to us during our yearly planning meeting. While in Bali, two aid initiatives were brought to our attention—Karuna Bali and IDEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.karunabali.com/&#34;&gt;Karuna Bali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days after we settled in at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hubud.org/hubud-villa/&#34;&gt;Hubud&lt;/a&gt;, Novi Danto, an employee of Karuna, spoke to us about how the organization was making great strides in teaching teenage children from smaller villages who might not otherwise have access to educational opportunities. Based in the town of Campuhan, Karuna Bali provides education for young adults in introductory computing, English and personal leadership skills. Best of all, Karuna Bali&amp;rsquo;s administration is entirely funded, so &amp;ldquo;100% of sponsorship donations are applied to the program.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a great cause, and our 2015 goal is to fully sponsor the tuition fees for three students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idepfoundation.org/&#34;&gt;IDEP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEP is a well established organization that works in the area of sustainable agriculture, mostly focusing on permaculture, tree planting, and youth environmental education. But a major side focus is training for natural disaster preparedness (which are a constant threat to the region), and assisting &amp;ldquo;local communities to provide food, shelter, energy and other needs in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.&amp;rdquo; IDEP employs local people, but also have a lot of support from offshore expertise and are endorsed by UNESCO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think IDEP has both the scale and depth of knowledge to make a substantial difference through education, farming practice, and helping to  build robust communities across Indonesia. Our goal is to contribute $10,000 to IDEP by the end of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many wonderful charities and initiatives that need funding around the world, so if you&amp;rsquo;re able, we encourage you to give back anything you can. And if you&amp;rsquo;d like to join us in funding our 2015 charities, here are the donation pages for both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.karunabali.com/index.php?section=5&#34;&gt;Karuna Bali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idepfoundation.org/howyoucanhelp/donatetoday&#34;&gt;IDEP&lt;/a&gt; (and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6239401/k.C01C/Global_Action_Fund/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp&#34;&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt;, our 2014 choice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The 25 most popular new domain extensions on iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/tld&#34;&gt;ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;, there are 3,177,772 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) registered to date. What that says about the overall popularity of the rollout is up for debate, but there&amp;rsquo;s no denying the success of some of the extensions. .XYZ, .CLUB, and a bunch of the city gTLDs are doing quite well, and even some of the less popular ones (62 at the moment) have broken the 10,000 registrations mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, at least for me, looking at an overall popularity list doesn&amp;rsquo;t really say anything. I want to know what the people I identify with are using, and for that, I need some specific stats—stats from our customers. Here&amp;rsquo;s what we found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The top 25 gTLDs on iwantmyname&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CLUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.LINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.GURU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.KIWI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.INTERNATIONAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.INSTITUTE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.ACADEMY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BLUE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TODAY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.EXPERT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.FOUNDATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.AGENCY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.GALLERY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NYC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.EMAIL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TIPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.LAND&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.ZONE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.EDUCATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COMPANY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BEST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Selected thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that hit me after seeing the list was how different it was than the ntldstats &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/tld&#34;&gt;popularity list&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few of the more interesting findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.XYZ is nowhere to be found on our list, but it&amp;rsquo;s far-and-away the most registered new gTLD on the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BLUE is in our top 10, but is #120 overall. Perhaps our monthly &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&#34;&gt;domain discounts&lt;/a&gt; are more popular than I thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re clearly popular amongst creative professionals. .PHOTO, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .AGENCY, .GALLERY, .CLOTHING, .COMPANY, and .TECHNOLOGY are all in our top 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As well as education: .INSTITUTE, .ACADEMY, .EDUCATION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was to be expected—.GURU and .EXPERT are both on the list (we clearly have brilliant customers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t looked in a while (or at all), be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;gTLD page&lt;/a&gt;. We have 241 extensions available to be registered now, and a few hundred more that can be preordered through our system. New extensions are added every month, so don&amp;rsquo;t be a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A three-pronged approach to communications chaos</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you talk to the communications manager (or similar position) of a brand of just about any size, you might notice a small tinge of panic in their voice. It&amp;rsquo;s all just too much. On one hand, communicating with audiences is easier than ever, with seemingly infinite platforms to engage with infinite types of customers. But on the other hand, keeping up with it all while not sounding insane is madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a personal example. Our primary communications goal is to build an authentic brand relationship with our customers. That may sound like an oxymoron, but it&amp;rsquo;s really not. We&amp;rsquo;re not looking to be part of your social scene, and we&amp;rsquo;ll never expect you to wake up every morning pining over what we have to say, but we do hope that when your friends ask for a domain registrar recommendation, you&amp;rsquo;re confident enough in us steer them our way. And the best way to gain your trust (aside from constantly improving our platform) is to let you in a bit—to show you what we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on, thinking about, creating, and improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most active channel we have (by pure volume) is our growing handful of social feeds, but they require daily/hourly customer attention (as well as some interesting Buffer coordination). Our community is great (we have real readers who start real conversations), but a lot of what we&amp;rsquo;re posting gets lost in the black hole of the internet. As Marco Arment &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marco.org/2014/11/01/short-form-blogging&#34;&gt;stated recently&lt;/a&gt;, too many good ideas are being dumped into Twitter, where nearly everything is &amp;ldquo;immediately skimmed over, forgotten, and lost to the vast depth of the mostly unsearchable, practically inaccessible Twitter archive.&amp;rdquo; His example was Twitter, but it could really be said for any social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in addition to social, we also have an active blog. But here&amp;rsquo;s the problem I have with blogs, especially blogs attached to brands—discovery is a mess. In my personal life, I&amp;rsquo;ve almost completely turned over my article-finding to the people and platforms sifting through the news best. Aggregators like Techmeme and Hacker News are so good at what they do, and my daily email from NextDraft adequately covers the rest of what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world. Beyond that, nearly everything I read comes from Twitter, and as stated before, most tweets die moments after they&amp;rsquo;re posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick recap: So to get a blog post in front of me in 2014, it has to either get picked up by a tiny handful of eyes attached to aggregators, or tweeted enough times to catch me right when I&amp;rsquo;m checking. Bad news for brands—getting picked up by aggregators is hard, and the odds I&amp;rsquo;ll see any given tweet is quite low (and I check often&amp;hellip; most people don&amp;rsquo;t even check their feed every day). Basically, you&amp;rsquo;d need a coordinated plan to get me to read anything not reaching critical mass, and as a brand writer myself, that&amp;rsquo;s so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got a blog and all the social media platforms taken care of, our new goal is to find a way to reach our audience without having to make a constant scene. Something that&amp;rsquo;s completely opt-in, doesn&amp;rsquo;t get passed through too many confusing algorithm filters before it reaches people, and is distributed on a platform that everyone already has—email. Starting early 2015, we&amp;rsquo;re going to start sending a monthly email, and we think it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect channel for our brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a journalism outfit, most of our customers come to our site looking for something very specific—either to buy a domain or to mess with some DNS settings. The less we&amp;rsquo;re in the way, the better. And in a way, that&amp;rsquo;s how newsletters are meant to operate—just opt-in, read an occasional email (filled with all sorts of great stuff and interesting updates), and you&amp;rsquo;re done. Quick and painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all our channels, I really think the new email will be the best suited for our brand. But even still, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it quite cracks the brand messaging conundrum. The goal of these messaging channels is to humanize the experience—to make us seem like real people who care (we really do!)—but is it human to have a coordinated, three-pronged approach to interfacing with people at their desired consumption times? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure, but I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a better solution yet (hence the insanity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the thinking continues (a good NZ beer might help).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Should you put all your products and ideas on one domain?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, I, like many of my colleagues, have a bit of a problem. I think of the web as a blank canvas, just waiting for my ideas to populate its empty space. And every time I have a new idea, I do one thing—scramble to grab the corresponding domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ongoing quest has gotten a bit easier since the launch of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; (being able to get just about any name in some form is a huge time-saver), but the underlying problem still remains. If/when I lose interest trying to make small ideas flourish, I find myself sitting on a pile of empty dreams and untapped potential (at least until the domains expire).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real hurdle is the process it takes to create and market new sites. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier today than it was a decade ago, but you still have to design them (although templates are getting better and better), brand them, come up with a consistent content strategy, create a bunch of social accounts and mailing lists, then promote the hell out of them. It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed solution? From Brian Knapp, in an article titled, &lt;a href=&#34;http://retromocha.com/learn/put-everything-on-one-domain/&#34;&gt;Everything On One Domain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much more value in having everything on this website than there is in having even two or three different domains we are managing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is when we want to launch something new or explore an idea, we just create a page and put it out there, email our list, and see what people think. Also, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to hunt for a new domain name for every idea we have. We just create a new page and boom, we&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that any time you can increase focus and decrease friction in your business you are better off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, stop buying new domains and start focusing your energy on one domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Focusing on one domain worked pretty well for Apple, it might work for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I firmly agree with the one-site-all-product mentality for a lot of things (most of my ideas certainly don&amp;rsquo;t need full sites), but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s quite the one-size-fits-all solution the author suggests. Yes, using one domain for everything in the brand &amp;ldquo;worked pretty well for Apple&amp;rdquo; (although one could argue that Beats and FileMaker break the narrative), but would it have been good for Lifehacker to have started on a big, bundled Gawker Media site, or your local restaurant group to roll up its various entities into one big menu monster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, when you pile everything into one domain, you&amp;rsquo;re severely limiting your branding options. Instead of giving every new project start its own personality, you&amp;rsquo;re all but forced to roll everything into your overarching aesthetic. That&amp;rsquo;s fine for a small dev shop, or even a giant cohesive brand like Apple, but what happens when your ideas jump from music production to digital photography to urban farming? Might you want separate concepts then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, by putting all your ideas on one domain, are you limiting each idea&amp;rsquo;s potential success/growth? Would Twitter be Twitter if, in 2006, it shared a page with Odeo? Or would Basecamp have ever become a huge success if 37 Signals didn&amp;rsquo;t roll it out on its own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas, like most things, it all depends on what you&amp;rsquo;re looking to accomplish. If you&amp;rsquo;re finding yourself piling up domains to tickle your every fancy, it may be wise to take the advice of Brian Knapp. For me, my personal brand would be infinitely stronger if I&amp;rsquo;d just consolidated my random work over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to break out though. As I said before, the new gTLDs make it easier than ever to find great domain names (&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html&#34;&gt;straying from .com is A-ok&lt;/a&gt; in my opinion), and in the scheme of things, the costs associated are fairly minimal. Just know that with every new site/project you create, whether it&amp;rsquo;s on your current site or a new one, you&amp;rsquo;re either stretching your capabilities to some degree or neglecting something old—and very few good things in life come from divided focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the wise Kenny Rodgers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn481KcjvMo&#34;&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve got to know when to hold &amp;lsquo;em. Know when to fold &amp;lsquo;em. Know when to walk away. And know when to run.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bali, our destination for mapping out 2015</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being scattered all over the world has its advantages. For one, there are no work hours, set workspaces, or dress codes. And meetings are cut to a minimum because there&amp;rsquo;s only so much time everyone is online at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you need some face-to-face time to make in-person connections. To hash out real problems and create lasting solutions. So once a year, we like to meet up for a week or so and get it all out of our system. Last year we chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/the-iwantmyname-team-on-tour-fiji-edition.html&#34;&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, which is only a short 2.5 hour flight from New Zealand, and it went so well that we stayed with the four-letter theme and packed our bags for Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-11-11-monkeys.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;monkeys&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bali, in case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a little tropical island east of Jakarta in Indonesia. You&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard of it, but unless you live in the region you probably don&amp;rsquo;t have a grasp of how dense its cities are. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bali &amp;ndash; 5,780 km2 &amp;ndash; 4,225,384 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Zealand &amp;ndash; 268,021 km2 &amp;ndash; 4,537,081 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in a fraction of the land area, Bali fits in basically the same amount of people as all of New Zealand. And you can tell right away, from the moment you race out of the airport. Sure, there are vast stretches of jungle and open space, but the cities we were in—Denpasar and Ubud—are decidedly urban. Everything is packed in tight, and just a few steps in any direction are cafes, art shops, clothing stores, spas, and markets. And the roads are filled with a type of traffic I&amp;rsquo;d never seen before—lanes are really just guidelines, a coordination of emergency blinkers and honks replace traditional turn signal use, and every inch of free road is filled by daring scooter drivers. For the uninitiated, driving in Bali is complete chaos (just don&amp;rsquo;t do it), but with a cab or driver, it&amp;rsquo;s really quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-11-11-bali-beach.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;beach&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the city cores though are a collection of magical little places. Grand rice terraces, an unforgettable monkey forest, spectacular beaches, giant cliffs, ancient temples, the works. The island can be anything you want it to be—an exotic urban destination with spicy food and endless shopping, or a relaxing paradise with countless amenities. And it&amp;rsquo;s more affordable than you&amp;rsquo;d ever think—having the entire team come and stay in Bali for the week turned out to cost about the same as having everyone meet up in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-11-11-hubud-villa.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hubud Villa&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the main purpose of the trip was 2015 planning, we found a unique rental in Ubud, a city in the forest, around 30-45 minutes north of Denpasar and the beach. It was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hubud.org/hubud-villa/&#34;&gt;a villa&lt;/a&gt; owned by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hubud.org&#34;&gt;Hubud&lt;/a&gt; CoWorking Space, a popular spot for all the area&amp;rsquo;s brightest tech founders, designers, writers, and developers. But in Ubud, even the coworking spaces are a bit funky, as the typical working environment is augmented by an in-house vegan raw bar/coffee shop, outdoor beanbag seating, and tons of events and learning opportunities. (As well as conferences like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.up.co/communities/indonesia/bali/startup-weekend/4891&#34;&gt;Startup Weekend Bali&lt;/a&gt;, which we&amp;rsquo;re happily sponsoring.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The villa itself was quite nice, with a beautiful pool that perpetually stayed cool throughout the hot, tropical days. And the large kitchen and outdoor meeting areas were perfect for getting the gang together, allowing us to gather for a number of concentrated days to work out the future of the company. The pain points, the growth areas, where we want to go as a group, and where we want to go as people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus was on balancing growth with who we are. We&amp;rsquo;re a small team by design, and we only grow when needs arise (i.e., we&amp;rsquo;re bootstrapped, so we take hiring decisions seriously). Nothing is rushed, and nothing is forced. Our main goal is not to be like GoDaddy, or to have millions upon millions of customers in the near future. We just want to keep providing great experiences to our customers, and comfortable livability to everyone on our team (team sanity is an under-appreciated metric).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2015, we&amp;rsquo;re going to work harder than ever to simplify domain registration and management for our customers—you. Because if we can keep you happy, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll tell a friend or two about what we do. That&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;ve grown from the start, and that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;ll be from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quick Bali tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-11-11-bali-coffee.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Seniman&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in Ubud searching for an excellent cup of coffee (I crave a solid pour-over in the morning), &lt;a href=&#34;http://senimancoffee.com&#34;&gt;Seniman Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is a great choice. The place is awesome for working or hanging out, the coffee and food are really good, and their cold brew is the best I had on the trip (there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like a cold brew on a hot Bali day).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mexican food addiction is real (particularly &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Mexican food addiction), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://tacocasabali.com&#34;&gt;Taco Casa&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic option (they make their own tortillas).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bali is a good place for vegetarians, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d4930720-Reviews-The_Elephant_Restaurant_Bar-Ubud_Bali.html&#34;&gt;The Elephant&lt;/a&gt; was an excellent choice with an amazing view. If you go, be sure to get the fresh coconut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t leave Bali without getting a massage. Find the best place you can afford (everything in Bali is quite affordable), and chill out for a bit. You probably deserve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The typical local beer is Bintang, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find it literally everywhere (sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s even there when you don&amp;rsquo;t want it). If and when you need something different, go find some Stark Beer. After endless Bintang, it really hits the spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Subdomain rot and the security implications</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like us, you probably know all-to-well the excitement of trying out new hosted services, then linking them to a subdomain of your main domain. You might try out a platform like Desk and put it on help.domain.tld, then try another platform on support.domain.tld. And inevitably, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the one you like best and move on from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so many of us make the mistake of forgetting all the unused subdomains we have. On the surface, nothing on your site is any different, but then you start noticing the credit card statements filled with services you&amp;rsquo;re not actually using. Canceling them is easy, but then there&amp;rsquo;s the domain side. Even after you cancel the billing, your unused subdomain (let&amp;rsquo;s say help.domain.tld, which was on Desk) is still being linked to the platform, and when you go to the domain, you&amp;rsquo;re met with the default platform error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing to worry about, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong, wrong, wrong. Because your subdomain is still being linked to the platform on the domain side, any not-so-well-meaning person can register for a Desk account and link it to the subdomain that&amp;rsquo;s already setup. Then, basically, they&amp;rsquo;re you. Everything they do with that Desk account looks legit, and theres really no way for you to notice because it&amp;rsquo;s all happening outside of your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a risk we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep under control with regular cleanups of our zone file, but we were reminded of it yesterday because of a post on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.detectify.com/post/100600514143/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-heroku-github-desk&#34;&gt;detectify blog&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, they also link to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://redoctober.detectify.com&#34;&gt;quick tool&lt;/a&gt; that let&amp;rsquo;s you know if you&amp;rsquo;re in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you do anything today, be sure to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://redoctober.detectify.com&#34;&gt;the tool&lt;/a&gt;. We were sure to run it right away, and if you like to try new platforms even half as much as we do, you could save yourself a major headaches down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Nielson and Adobe are looking to rate the internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2014/10/nielsen-will-soon-rate-everything-web-videos-articles/&#34;&gt;From Wired:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nielsen ratings have long held huge sway over the business of television, but television isn’t like it used to be. So, on Tuesday, Nielsen announced that it’s expanding its ratings system to all kinds of digital content to give both its creators and advertisers a more meaningful way to measure popularity in the online era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most striking development in Adobe’s new system is that it’s designed for comparing disparate kinds of content. The new ratings, Nielsen says, can rank an online video next to a podcast next to an article. Unlike television or radio, the internet isn’t a medium that funnels just one format. The aim of Nielsen’s new ratings is to create a context to figure out what people care about online, regardless of what form it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a reminder that internet advertising is still in its infancy. It&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see what the internet looks like in 20 years, once the big media entities switch their primary funding from TV to the web. The last two lines of the article say it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old way made a lot of people in old media a lot of money. If someone can approximate the old way for new media, maybe more of that money will start rolling in, just like it used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Need to know: requesting personal information from your audience</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, data is king. Big Data, data mining, data-driven decisions. It gives the impression that when you&amp;rsquo;re building your online presence, whether a community, business, or audience (or all of the above), you need to learn as much about those you interact with as possible. Especially before you engage in any important decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing everything (ideally with the first impression/interaction) should give us the insights we need to develop the perfect product, grow the most engaged audience, and pretty much be our crystal ball, right? Well, not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start off by reframing things. Imagine yourself on the other side of the equation for a moment. Because&amp;hellip; well, you are. Every day. Every time you read an article online, buy something, subscribe to a newsletter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to get something done online, you want it to be fast, clear, and not ask more from you than is relevant or necessary. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty common experience to start the process to get something, like an e-book, and abandon it because there&amp;rsquo;s just no way they need your phone number, birth date, employment history, and blood type in addition to your name and email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, from the other side, the more information a company or individual has, the more there is to analyze and target. It also implies a stronger interest in the product or service. Gotta fill out those customer profiles, see where the low-hanging fruit and high-growth verticals are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier to develop trust than to rebuild it, though. So it&amp;rsquo;s wise to start slowly when getting to know an audience, and work your way up. It&amp;rsquo;s no different than meeting people in person. We start out with small talk and introductions &amp;mdash; your name, perhaps what you do, and how you know the host of the party or are tied to the group putting on the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit awkward and uncomfortable if someone you just met launches into the TMI (too much information), like their unemployment or health woes, very personal interests, or starts asking excessively personal questions of you. It makes you more inclined to cut bait and flee and to dive into conversation and relationship-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with most things, there&amp;rsquo;s a spectrum of attitudes to consider. Some people do their best to be entirely anonymous online. They won&amp;rsquo;t easily provide &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; information, and will extensively question why you need every detail you request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other people, on the other end, unfortunately, are far too open and trusting, and don&amp;rsquo;t even practice basic privacy and security protection. (Never EVER email passwords or credit card details to ANYONE, including us.) They don&amp;rsquo;t understand how easy it would be to use their information—for nefarious purposes as easily as to help them, which is probably what they were requesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some things you can offer people without requiring or requesting anything, like great blog content, for example. But if you want to subscribe to a blog to be sure you don&amp;rsquo;t miss anything, then a bit of information is required. If you want to buy something, a bit more information is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always segment, too. For example, have a main newsletter, product news, or blog subscriber list, and then add special interest lists that people can opt into. This helps you target your communications and sales strategies better, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people on both sides of the communications equation, a good question to ask regularly is: &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for me, and what&amp;rsquo;s in it for them?&lt;/em&gt; You want there to be some balance there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people do trust you with their information, be as careful with it as you would be with your own. Practice the Golden Rule. If you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a bunch of unsolicited emails after signing up for a newsletter, then don&amp;rsquo;t do that to your subscribers. Sending a confirmation and welcome? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be clear when people are signing up or purchasing from you how you intend to use their information, and when. Yes, doing business with someone gives you certain communications rights, but don&amp;rsquo;t abuse that. Just because you can doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you should. And keep up to date on spam laws and your responsibilities. The penalties can be pretty stiff, often deservedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, double opt-in is a bit more effort for you, and might net a few fewer contacts, but those ones will be much more engaged and definitely want to hear from you, so overall it&amp;rsquo;s a much bigger win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone says they don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear from you, remove them from your list. You &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to inquire as to why, but most likely they just aren&amp;rsquo;t interested. Accept it and do it quickly. (And make unsubscribe and related links easy to find.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also goes without saying that when you do contact people, make it relevant to them. This will maintain the goodwill, and be more likely to keep them interested in hearing from you. This could be about your work, products, or services. It could be able cool stuff you heard about that they might also be interested in. It could be to ask them for feedback or input. (See the above paragraph on segmenting your communications as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Internet is a pretty social place, and it&amp;rsquo;s provided myriad new ways for people to interact, learn, and do business. (We&amp;rsquo;re huge fans.) :) But the Internet runs on people and our choices and actions. Having an agenda or being invisible is no reason not to maintain our manners, good judgement, and smart business practices. In face, I&amp;rsquo;d argue it&amp;rsquo;s even more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know what your best communications strategies are for getting to know and keeping in touch with your audience, community, or customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>StartUp shares the agony of naming a company, plus my short list of naming rules</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-10-15-startup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;StartUp&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a podcast listener, Alex Blumberg&amp;rsquo;s new show, StartUp, just might be the best new show around. Here&amp;rsquo;s the synopsis, from the StartUp about page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Alex Blumberg. My experience is in public radio, as a producer for This American Life and as a co-founder of the business-economics series Planet Money. After years of reporting on other people&amp;rsquo;s businesses, I decided to start my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show follows what happens next – my difficult journey from man to businessman. It&amp;rsquo;s a classic start-up story, but one that&amp;rsquo;s recorded in real time. I&amp;rsquo;ve documented disastrous pitches to investors, difficult conversations with my wife, and tense negotiations with my co-founder. The result is an honest, transparent account of something that happens all the time, but that we can rarely listen in on: starting a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend starting at the beginning, but the latest episode, titled &amp;ldquo;How To Name Your Company&amp;rdquo; is a fantastic look at how hard branding really is. Give it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172008630&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=true&amp;amp;show_comments=false&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;visual=true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote an article asking &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html&#34;&gt;whether domain extensions matter anymore&lt;/a&gt;, and this episode really got me thinking. If you&amp;rsquo;re creating a company with global business aspirations, do you need to get a .com?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the episode, Alex Blumberg mentions a handful of tech companies that end with &amp;ldquo;ly&amp;rdquo;—and that was due to the brief popularity of the .ly domain extension at the end of the 00&amp;rsquo;s. Bit.ly is one that sticks in my head, and even though the .ly domain now forwards to a .com, the reason for the change was more to do with .ly being the ccTLD for Libya (government instability is never good) than the domain not being successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, if you&amp;rsquo;re a new business, the most important aspect is credibility. In 2014, .com is still probably the most credible extension for the average consumer, but we&amp;rsquo;re at a point now where people probably aren&amp;rsquo;t going to blink at .io, .co, .club, or really any extension that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make your name seem spammy or computer generated. So YOURNAME.club probably works, while MISPELLEDNAME.club or YOURNAME567.club probably won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to create a small set of &amp;ldquo;rules to name by,&amp;rdquo; this would be it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re free to use any domain extension (and there are a ton of good options now), but people are trained to be wary of salesy or spammy names. Use your best judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do, make sure your name is spelled correctly. Intentional vowel dropping is fine, but if your domain is &amp;ldquo;newzeland.TLD,&amp;rdquo; people are rightly going to question your legitimacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t go to lengths to make your brand name fit into the .com namespace. If your brand name is &amp;ldquo;Name,&amp;rdquo; you can add one word to it, max. hearName.com, Namemedia.com, useName.com—all ok. Nametryitnow.com is not. We have 226 new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt; available now, and so many more country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) on top of that, so take advantage!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>The Grid — AI websites that design themselves</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXA4-5x31V0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;The Grid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;An interview with Dan Tocchini, Founder and CEO of The Grid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;The Grid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has come a long way since the &amp;ldquo;dawn of the blogs&amp;rdquo; in the early 90&amp;rsquo;s, but as Anil Dash &lt;a href=&#34;http://dashes.com/anil/2014/09/15-lessons-from-15-years-of-blogging.html&#34;&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;The tools for blogging have been extraordinarily stagnant. And this stagnation is particularly egregious when we consider that almost every common behavior on the big social networks is a subset of what we originally thought blogging might be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting the future of blogging—and website creation in general—is a tall task, but there&amp;rsquo;s one upcoming platform that seems to be dreaming bigger than the rest—&lt;a href=&#34;https://thegrid.io/&#34;&gt;The Grid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s their pitch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not another do-it-yourself website builder. The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it &amp;ndash; videos, images, text, urls and more &amp;ndash; and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. As your needs grow, it evolves with you, effortlessly adapting to your needs. Want to add e-commerce? Social feeds? A different layout? The Grid just takes care of it. This is not a website builder. This is your personal AI web developer. Its first masterpiece is the website you&amp;rsquo;re looking at right now. Its next one could be yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty impressive stuff! Needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;m now Founding Member #1173.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to geek out on new platforms as much as I do, definitely check out The Grid&amp;rsquo;s website for yourself. Beta testing is going on as we speak, and if you &lt;a href=&#34;https://thegrid.io/#1173&#34;&gt;sign up for a membership now&lt;/a&gt; **, you&amp;rsquo;ll be locked in at $8/mo (as opposed to the normal $25/mo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Just to be totally transparent, when I signed up, the email receipt had a bit at the bottom, in bold caps, that said, &amp;ldquo;INVITE 3 FRIENDS AND WE’LL PAY FOR YOUR MEMBERSHIP.&amp;rdquo; So if you use the link above, you&amp;rsquo;re indirectly supporting my &amp;ldquo;awesome-new-web-platform&amp;rdquo; addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;An interview with Dan Tocchini, Founder and CEO of The Grid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-10-16-the-grid-team.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Grid Team&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So first, tell me what The Grid is? Who&amp;rsquo;s it for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; The Grid is the first AI platform for designing websites. So basically, you throw content in—images, videos, text—and the output is an elegant website that&amp;rsquo;s as easy to update as a social network. But it&amp;rsquo;s constantly evolving itself, trying to figure out the best possible layout—to go above and beyond the best drag-and-drop builders out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;s it for? I believe in designing products for humans, not businesses. The initial market is definitely the creators, the artists, the entrepreneurs—people who have the most immediate need for websites. I think that as time goes, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be for everyone. For humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So you mentioned that it&amp;rsquo;s as easy as your social network. Do you see The Grid becoming a social replacement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; Well I think social&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;media is a temporary replacement for websites, because websites are so hard to do anything with. So in that sense, when there&amp;rsquo;s a good-enough website, it&amp;rsquo;ll be inherently social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think things like Pinterest and Facebook and Twitter have really bloomed because of the lack of good-enough website solutions—the lack of a good enough place to put your content, so we&amp;rsquo;ve all settled to build someone else&amp;rsquo;s website. At the end of the day, your Facebook page is just part of someone else&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one thing I think traditional websites lack, and that&amp;rsquo;s the network effect you get from something like Facebook. You go on and you have a built in audience of X number of people. Now I see that The Grid has a kind of newsfeed built in—tell me how that works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; So if you think about it, what makes things like Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter social? Even Tumblr. Really, it&amp;rsquo;s the newsfeed—the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go and click on every single person&amp;rsquo;s profile to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. And right now on websites, what are you going to do? Bookmark it? RSS died, and for good reason. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for sites to know how many followers they have, and you don&amp;rsquo;t really know if someone likes something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So The Grid is hopefully going to solve the entire website problem. Not just the creation of sites, but the entire network around them. So you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to follow websites that are created on The Grid as well as websites that aren&amp;rsquo;t created on The Grid. You&amp;rsquo;ll have a newsfeed of all the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How will that look?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; We have some prototypes laid out. It looks a little like &lt;a href=&#34;https://thegrid.io/&#34;&gt;The Grid website&lt;/a&gt;—our site is the first website we&amp;rsquo;ve really let loose in the wild that&amp;rsquo;s fully built with our AI system. The newsfeed will look a lot like that—it won&amp;rsquo;t be as linear and monotone as the newsfeeds you&amp;rsquo;re used to right now. There will be some variation in the scrolling experience, and we&amp;rsquo;ll let things take up space to create rhythm as you scroll. It&amp;rsquo;ll feel more like a website, just without the branded header at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So speaking of design and how websites are built, is this the end of web design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;Laughter&gt; Really, it begins with a good designer&amp;rsquo;s brain. We&amp;rsquo;re doing our best to build a deep API so people can create layout filters, but the goal is for designers to take the things they&amp;rsquo;re doing and really design a section of the layout. Get it totally right, and then give it constraints, or high level rules, for when that section of the layout should be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, on The Grid&amp;rsquo;s website, we literally just threw in some Markdown files, Word docs, and images and it went. We didn&amp;rsquo;t choose the sections, or the order. Other than the top section, all the colors were extracted from the content provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. There&amp;rsquo;s one section of the page that has a girl with crazy hair, and on the left there&amp;rsquo;s text on top of the image, and that text doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a background. What you can do is design a section that says, here&amp;rsquo;s text on top of an image, and the text doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a background because this image has an area of low contrast that&amp;rsquo;s suitable to put text on top. So we give those API&amp;rsquo;s to designers so they can create rules like that, then the way the content is marshaled in is determined by them. So we&amp;rsquo;re not replacing designers, we&amp;rsquo;re replacing the task of manually putting content into rigid templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing designers would just be crazy. Maybe in 100 years. Right now, that&amp;rsquo;s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So what happens if you see something in The Grid that you don&amp;rsquo;t like—something that&amp;rsquo;s in a place it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is, we&amp;rsquo;re really getting away from websites looking one way. When you come back to it, it might look a little different—even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t add any new content. And there might be subtle variations. One layout might have things on the left, then next time they could be on the right. So there isn&amp;rsquo;t just one way your site looks. But we do have a way to say, &amp;ldquo;so that&amp;rsquo;s crap,&amp;rdquo; but that&amp;rsquo;s really at a high level.  We don&amp;rsquo;t give control over individual sections, because the moment you start doing that, your site becomes brittle—we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to A/B test or go beyond what you manually configure. That&amp;rsquo;s not the world we want to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we want is for you to treat The Grid as a designer. You send your content to the designer, they come up with some ideas, then send it back. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, you can say &amp;ldquo;give me something else,&amp;rdquo; but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell your designer to make the logo bigger. If you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a good designer, that&amp;rsquo;s just not going to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk a little about A/B testing.  I read that it&amp;rsquo;s automated. Does that mean the AI will be able to tweak your content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; What happens is that the layout engine &amp;ldquo;solves&amp;rdquo; your design. It takes a piece of content and creates a suitable solution. With the types of algorithms we&amp;rsquo;re using, there&amp;rsquo;s ambiguity in the results—many just-as-suitable solutions to your content. Your content could be computed as 15 different layouts, all of which look equally good to us. So the system goes through and figures out which one is best by testing them each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go through and change words of anything, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; No, but there&amp;rsquo;s one thing we really want to do, and that&amp;rsquo;s add the ability to create alternate titles for layout solution sets—so you could have multiple titles and see which one converts best. The real idea is to have A/B testing that scales, because everyone talks about A/B testing, but no one really does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A/B testing always makes me think of e-commerce, which seems to be a pretty big focus. How is it going to work? From what I gather, you just drop items in and set a price, then magic happens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah. So first of all, e-commerce is a very big deal. When we first started this thing, we knew that to really solve a website problem, we&amp;rsquo;d have to make e-commerce a priority. It&amp;rsquo;s critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on The Grid, instead of having a rigid content hierarchy, where you have videos, images, products, galleries, shipping carts, this, and that—instead, you just post stuff. And if you put a price on it, it&amp;rsquo;s a product, or you could link it to a product. If you add a bunch of images and a bunch of videos, it&amp;rsquo;s a gallery. We&amp;rsquo;re purposefully keeping what you can do with commerce very flexible and ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Can you expand on that a bit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re very ambitious with what we&amp;rsquo;re going after, and there are a lot of things around commerce and the social connections within commerce that I think are going to be some of the most critical things when we&amp;rsquo;re at scale. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things we can&amp;rsquo;t talk about too much right now, but we&amp;rsquo;re definitely going to be pushing the envelope on not just the website creation, but the connections you make with websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little further out, we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at financial connections—having money seamlessly just go between people. Like, when you send a friend to someone&amp;rsquo;s website to see a video, but you happen to buy something through that connection, maybe a wallet would go up. There are a lot of really cool things we want to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then speaking really far down the line, to me, these are really just all 2D interface problems. Then things get crazy. &amp;lt; laughs &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Last question. How big do you think this office is going to get (the room is small, but well designed, with three people plugging away at workstations)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan:&lt;/em&gt; You know, we&amp;rsquo;re very non-local. Our team is about 20 people now, and most of the guys are in Europe. We&amp;rsquo;re in, I think, eight time zones. I kind of like the non-traditional office thing. We get together every couple months in a different city around the world and rent the best Airbnb place we can find, and we just hack together for awhile without all the life distractions. It&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we&amp;rsquo;ve been to Berlin a couple times, Florence, Toronto—they&amp;rsquo;ve come out to San Francisco a couple times.  I think it what would be killer to continue that, but we&amp;rsquo;ll probably end up having a base here in San Francisco and a base in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Unknown life lessons from diving into .com history</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I may be promoting everything that&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the internet today, but I kind of love a good list. And today I came across a great one—a list of the 100 oldest .com domain names, which go all the way back to March 15, 1985. Here are the first ten, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.domainholdings.com/recent-sales/100-oldest-domain-names/&#34;&gt;Domain Holdings&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 15, 1985 &amp;ndash; Symbolics.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 24, 1985 &amp;ndash; BBN.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 24, 1985 &amp;ndash; Think.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 11, 1985 &amp;ndash; MCC.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 30, 1985 &amp;ndash; DEC.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 7, 1985 &amp;ndash; Northrop.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 9, 1986 &amp;ndash; Xerox.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 17, 1986 &amp;ndash; SRI.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 3, 1986 &amp;ndash; HP.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 5, 1986 &amp;ndash; Bellcore.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down the list you get a who&amp;rsquo;s-who of major tech companies: IBM.com, Intel.com, GE.com, AMD.com, Tandy.com, Apple.com. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting list, but thinking of what the world was like in 1985, I was craving context. The stories behind the domains that were registered before Tim Berners-Lee even conceived of a &amp;ldquo;World Wide Web.&amp;rdquo; So I headed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://symbolics.com/&#34;&gt;symbolics.com&lt;/a&gt; to see what I could find (did the site still exist?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;rsquo;s a strange site, clearly not related to the old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Symbolics&#34;&gt;Symbolics, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in any way, with an odd, side-scrolling homepage that showed little in the way of content. So I went to the FAQ to find out what&amp;rsquo;s up, and this little gem appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q. What is the point of this site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A. To offer curious Internet visitors an interesting way to navigate through historic Internet facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh. Next stop, the about page. At the top, it calls out that the site is now owned by a &amp;ldquo;small investor group&amp;rdquo; in Dallas, TX, and that there are advertising opportunities available (on the home page I&amp;rsquo;m guessing). But the story that follows makes it clear that the owner, Aron Maystedt, is really just hanging onto the domain because it&amp;rsquo;s a collectible—like a first-edition book. Or perhaps the &lt;em&gt;first ever&lt;/em&gt; book. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://symbolics.com/about-symbolics/&#34;&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. How did I come to own the first domain name registered on the Internet? Symbolics.com was registered on March 15, 1985. I was 5 years old. I like to tell everyone that I had incredible foresight as a toddler. But that’s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a bit about the Symbolics Computer Corporation. These are the people who registered the name in 1985, and they were a company way ahead of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original Symbolics company pioneered computer development. Symbolics designed and manufactured a line of Lisp machines, single-user computers optimized to run the Lisp programming language. The Lisp Machine was the first commercially available “workstation” (although that word had not yet been coined). Symbolics also made significant advances in software technology, and offered one of the premier software development environments of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter me, in 2009. I had always known (well, since the late 90s) that Symbolics.com was the first domain name registered on the Internet. It was a goal of mine to acquire one of the first few names ever registered. I know that others before me had reached out to Symbolics, and inquired about the purchase price of the domain name. For whatever reason, my timing was perfect (thank you Lord) and I contacted Symbolics right about the time they actually started considering selling the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story was amusing, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t have any of the wonder of being the first one to register a domain name. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to find something at the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symbolics-dks.com/&#34;&gt;Symbolics site&lt;/a&gt;, but no luck. Nothing to be found. SF Gate did run a good article back in 2010, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/25-years-of-com-domain-names-3270287.php&#34;&gt;25 years of .com domain names&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, where they contacted the Symbolics founders for the story. Unfortunately, they &amp;ldquo;didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember the event.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How funny is that. They registered the very first .com, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t even register in their memories. There&amp;rsquo;s a lesson in there somewhere, I just don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is yet.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How we upgraded our domain search using Erlang, RabbitMQ and Socket.IO</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we quietly released an almost completely reworked domain name search engine. Our older system, of which there had already been several iterations, was no longer coping with our incremental growth and the dozens of new top level domains being released each month (with 500+ more still due to launch). Not only are more people searching for domains, but the number of domains searched was stretching our old domain search engine&amp;rsquo;s limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an overview of the issues in our old system and how the new one solves these issues and sets us up for future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The old way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stack for search included an Erlang application (hereafter called &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt;) that listened for WebSocket connections using SockJS. It also listened to RabbitMQ messages from our web servers to indicate a new search had been triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-09-04-old-search-diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;Old search diagram&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a customer loaded the search page, their browser connected to SockJS with their session ID. When they entered a domain name, the search was sent to the web application, and then after some validation, the search was forwarded via RabbitMQ to &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt; with the session and search ID. This made &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt; do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a list of TLDs to the user with price information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make requests to the registries or registrars that we connect to, asking if the name is available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache responses to avoid duplicate checks for the same name and to avoid getting the TLD list from our database on every search request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward responses to the user using the session and search ID to match it to the SockJS connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this served us okay for a while, there were a few problems causing frustration for our customers and for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every time a domain name was searched, we sent back the list of TLDs which was mostly static.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A search would send requests to check &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; available TLDs at the time the search was sent. While we maintain a persistent connection to our upstream services and buffer these checks, sending this mass of checks at once tied up the queue until they were all processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We started hitting API limits for checks, although these issues were temporarily resolved by talking nicely to the right people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the above could probably have been worked around, but the most troubling was that SockJS connections would be unexpectedly terminated. This meant people would never get the list of TLDs, wait forever for results, or only get a partial list of availability. We tried the usual—checking connection limits, open file descriptors and timeouts etc.—but found nothing obvious. And unfortunately, none of us are extremely experienced Erlang developers, so despite reading the source code of our dependencies, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the cause. It was also impossible for us to replicate outside of production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The new way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that our biggest concern was the SockJS connections being prematurely terminated, we looked for a new library to use for WebSockets. In the end we chose Socket.IO (on Node.js) after their version 1.0 release. This allowed us to change the focus of the Erlang backend to checking domain availability, and the Node.js daemon to maintain WebSocket connections and forwarding search requests (again, via RabbitMQ) to &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt;, only this time, &lt;code&gt;namesearchd&lt;/code&gt; would reply via RabbitMQ and let Socket.IO deal with handing the response back to the customer&amp;rsquo;s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-09-04-new-search-diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;New search diagram&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other difference is that now the web application sends the TLD list to the client, which allows us to not have to send a list of all every TLD for each search request. The initial reason the TLD list was being sent for every search was that it could be different depending on what name you searched for. This filtering is now handled by client-side Javascript (and you’ll get an error if you cheekily use the Socket.IO connection to search for, say, a two-character domain on a TLD that doesn’t support two letter name registrations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frontend now only searches names as they appear on the screen. So instead of searching for all the TLDs at once, and potentially clogging up the pipes for other people searching at the same time as you, it’ll only show the availability of the domains you’re looking currently looking at. While this adds a slight delay to seeing the availability of a specific domain, it means searches like &lt;code&gt;myawesomename.com&lt;/code&gt; come back much faster because we&amp;rsquo;re not bothering to instantly search every TLD available (and because the customer has specified &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, it’ll show that TLD at the top).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new design also sets us up to substitute alternative approaches to domain name availability checks. Long lists of domains might be good for some people, while a category-grouping approach might work better for others. And customized search results based on where you&amp;rsquo;re browsing from (e.g. New Zealand visitors might see &lt;code&gt;.co.nz&lt;/code&gt; at the top.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Give it a go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in place, your domain searches are snappier and more stable. We&amp;rsquo;re now gearing up for alternative designs of our domain search results page. And we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts! Try the search box below and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New domain extension trends: cities, non-Latin are in, retail is not</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in domain names or like to follow the domain name industry, it&amp;rsquo;s good to take a step back every once in a while to look at the new gTLD (generic top-level domain) trends that are emerging. iwantmyname&amp;rsquo;s business model really doesn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from the popularity of one domain extension over another, but for us, this is perhaps the most exciting namespace expansion we&amp;rsquo;ll ever see. I mean, there&amp;rsquo;s a real chance that decades from now we&amp;rsquo;ll all look back at the early days of the internet and laugh about how everything used to end in .com. We&amp;rsquo;re still at the beginning of this whole &amp;ldquo;internet naming&amp;rdquo; thing, but the scaffolding for the future is being constructed before our very eyes. Here are some of the trends we&amp;rsquo;re noticing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;City TLDs are definitely going to be popular&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/08/hyperlocalize-with-a-city-tld.html&#34;&gt;talked about this&lt;/a&gt; a bunch in the past, but of the five city TLDs launched so far (.berlin, .hamburg, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nagoya&#34;&gt;.nagoya&lt;/a&gt;, .tokyo, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wien&#34;&gt;.wien&lt;/a&gt;), three are in the top 25 of domains registered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; at #2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&#34;&gt;.tokyo&lt;/a&gt; at #17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-hamburg&#34;&gt;.hamburg&lt;/a&gt; at #24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&#34;&gt;.london&lt;/a&gt;, is already at #18, even though it won&amp;rsquo;t be available for general registration until September 9th. If current success is any indication, we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing a lot of local websites with city TLDs in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Non-Latin TLDs are picking up steam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more exciting trends of this new naming expansion is the launch of TLDs that don&amp;rsquo;t use Latin characters. In the future we&amp;rsquo;ll have domains in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, and the internet will be better for it. The currently launched non-Latin gTLDs vary in popularity, but four are currently in the top 25:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.公司&lt;/a&gt; at #8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt; at #10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.网络&lt;/a&gt; at #12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; at #22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;General business TLDs are making a push&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business TLDs as a whole are a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but some of the more internet-native/savvy general business TLDs seem to be doing quite well. In the top 25, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&#34;&gt;.link&lt;/a&gt; at #4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.photography&lt;/a&gt; at #7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email&#34;&gt;.email&lt;/a&gt; at #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company&#34;&gt;.company&lt;/a&gt; at #14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-solutions&#34;&gt;.solutions&lt;/a&gt; at #15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center&#34;&gt;.center&lt;/a&gt; at #16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&#34;&gt;.technology&lt;/a&gt; at #20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&#34;&gt;.directory&lt;/a&gt; at #21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Retail and physical business TLDs are not&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While TLDs for companies that primarily live on the web are doing fairly well, traditionally brick-and-mortar businesses don&amp;rsquo;t seem as ready to migrate from .com. Extensions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&#34;&gt;.clothing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&#34;&gt;.bike&lt;/a&gt; are the top pair, but neither have more that 13,000 registrations. And promising TLDs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-equipment&#34;&gt;.equipment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&#34;&gt;.coffee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo&#34;&gt;.tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-boutique&#34;&gt;.boutique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing&#34;&gt;.plumbing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shoes&#34;&gt;.shoes&lt;/a&gt; have yet to crack the 10,000 registration mark. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that they won&amp;rsquo;t eventually be successful, but it seems like small businesses with physical locations are hesitant to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;ldquo;Discount TLDs&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t doing well at all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising trends is that the TLDs related to the deals industry aren&amp;rsquo;t doing well at all. The top of the pack, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cheap&#34;&gt;.cheap&lt;/a&gt;, only has 3,281 domains registered, sitting just out of the top 100 at #105. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blackfriday&#34;&gt;.blackfriday&lt;/a&gt;, the deals TLD for the day after Thanksgiving in the US? Only 657 total registrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a guess, but deal sites tend to struggle with legitimacy, and being an outlier in an industry with a lot of perceived fraud probably isn&amp;rsquo;t a compelling business plan. Once the world deems these new gTLDs normal, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the &amp;ldquo;discount TLDs&amp;rdquo; will start changing over to get out of the crowded .com namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All stats from &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/&#34;&gt;Domain Incite Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A free tool for finding the top sites in each domain extension</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-28-domain-punch.png&#34; alt=&#34;Domain Punch&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are countless sites on the web dishing out advice for how you should name your website/company, but sometimes the very best recommendation is to look at what&amp;rsquo;s currently popular. And &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/08/26/quickly-find-the-top-websites-built-on-new-tlds/&#34;&gt;Domain Name Wire&lt;/a&gt; recently found a great site for this—&lt;a href=&#34;https://domainpunch.com/topm/&#34;&gt;Domain Punch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Domain Punch does is list the Alexa top million websites, then lets you sort by top-level domain (TLD). So if you want to see the most popular sites on the web using .guru or .kiwi, you can (as long as the TLD has a site in the top million). It&amp;rsquo;s really handy, and best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s totally free to use (&lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/pro/&#34;&gt;Domain Incite Pro&lt;/a&gt; has a similar tool, but you have to be a paying customer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain Name Wire does bring up a good point though. &amp;ldquo;Now, a big caveat: these tools are based on Alexa data. Alexa is notoriously inaccurate. It’s just directionally correct. Domains separated by ranks of 10,000 and even 100,000 might actually be reversed for true traffic volume.&amp;rdquo; So take the rankings you see with a grain of salt—I&amp;rsquo;d recommend using this more for idea generation than stat collection.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Droplr is an exceptionally useful tool for sharing files and screenshots</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quietly resting on my desktop nav, next to the icons for Twitter, Dropbox, OnePassword, Wifi and Finder, is the stylized Droplr drop—arguably one of the most useful apps on my computer. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a whole lot, but what it does, it does quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-26-droplr-screenshot-one-compressor.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes, and lets you share, screenshots&lt;/strong&gt;: This may be a non-issue on the PC, but in OSX, the default screenshot app, Grab, really isn&amp;rsquo;t all that useful. For one, the default filetype used by Grab is TIFF, which almost always needs to be exported to .jpg or .png for any kind of practical use. And once the shot is taken, there aren&amp;rsquo;t any quick features for highlighting segments or leaving notes—you have to open files in other apps to do anything with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely replacing Grab on my computer is Droplr, which allows me to take regular screenshots, URL-as-photo screenshots (full-page shots) and &amp;ldquo;Capture and draw&amp;rdquo; screenshots, giving me some basic tools for circling key points and adding text.  Then, once your screenshot is taken, it&amp;rsquo;s automatically attached to a link in your clipboard, meaning you&amp;rsquo;re only a cmd-V away from sending your file to a friend or co-worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And screencasts!&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to tell someone how to do something, but showing them is almost always a better solution. So if you want to to show someone how to do a Photoshop effect or just where a basic option is hidden, Droplr screen recordings are definitely the answer. Just drag open a window to record in, do what you need to do, stop the recording, then send the auto-generated link (&lt;a href=&#34;http://iwmn.me/gG8O/5Y16w4yd&#34;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes file sharing simple&lt;/strong&gt;: For all the efficiency advancements computers have made in the last decade, sending basic files still seems a bit slow. But with Droplr, just select a file (up to 2GB) and hit option-D to copy it to your clipboard to send out (it&amp;rsquo;s great for sending private &lt;a href=&#34;http://iwmn.me/le6c/4NaMlFYk&#34;&gt;dog photos&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All your files are attached to a custom domain&lt;/strong&gt;: To me, this is an invaluable feature. When you&amp;rsquo;re sending files around, especially to clients, it&amp;rsquo;s important to establish a level of trust. So first, Droplr allows you to password protect your links and create self-destructing drops. But then it takes the next step and allows you to send links with your very own custom short domain. So instead of sending emails or messages with links to shady files, we can send out links like iwmn.me./XXXXXXX. And the setup is incredibly simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding a custom domain to Droplr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;the best apps and platforms&lt;/a&gt;, adding a custom domain is painless with iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-26-droplr-iwmn-add.png&#34; alt=&#34;Add Droplr&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you already have a short domain registered (if not, start &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/customize-droplr-with-your-own-domain&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), login to your iwantmyname account and select &lt;strong&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Services&lt;/strong&gt; under the &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; menu in the top nav.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From here, either type &lt;strong&gt;Droplr&lt;/strong&gt; into the search field, or select the app under the &lt;strong&gt;URL Shortener&lt;/strong&gt; menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select with domain you want to add Droplr too, then click &lt;strong&gt;Install Droplr&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, sign into your Droplr account (or &lt;a href=&#34;https://droplr.com/hello&#34;&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt; to sign up) and click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; in the bottom nav.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;strong&gt;Custom Domain&lt;/strong&gt; (you&amp;rsquo;ll need a &lt;a href=&#34;https://droplr.com/hello&#34;&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; account) and type in your short domain, then hit Save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you send your short domain, it&amp;rsquo;ll now look like short.tld/XXXX. If someone tried to go to short.tld though, they&amp;rsquo;d be redirected to droplr.com. To prevent this, under custom domain in the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; screen, add your primary domain into the &lt;strong&gt;Root Redirect&lt;/strong&gt; field. For us, that automatically redirects iwmn.me to iwantmyname.com, and for you it&amp;rsquo;ll do the same, but with your domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it. Now when you shorten links, send files or big screencasts, the link provided will be properly branded. If you&amp;rsquo;re having any issues with the setup process though, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re always here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname culture: On hiring and hierarchy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-19-iwmn-team.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Team&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one truth about growing a company is that at some point you&amp;rsquo;ll run out of qualified friends to employ. For us, our first hire outside of that group was a developer, because we badly needed someone who was good at the things we sucked at. And our hire was a good one, as he is an absolute expert in his field—but his most important trait was that he fit in really well with the team. Ever since our first hiring experience, we&amp;rsquo;ve made fitting in a top priority when adding team members, and it&amp;rsquo;s worked out extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When we first created iwantmyname we had all worked at companies of various sizes, and knew from the start that small, well-functioning teams almost always consisted of diverse people with different backgrounds, different (and abundant) experiences, and a high level of cohesiveness. And that high level of cohesiveness is important so that everyone can trust each other to do their jobs—which allows us to almost completely do away with the traditional management hierarchy. With everyone working on a defined aspect of the company, we can make sure everyone gets to try things out, make decisions, measure if they work, and report back to the team their successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies speak about flat hierarchy and how they don&amp;rsquo;t have many
control structures in place, but for us it was really something that just developed out of hiring the right people. If you work with peers you trust, a management layer becomes obsolete, which frees up additional time to get actual work done and move the company forward. The speed of the company should be at the speed of the workers, not of the management layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, hiring for us is an important factor and we don&amp;rsquo;t take it lightly. Hiring is also a limiting factor in our business, but by hiring the right people, taking longer to choose them, and not expanding our team too fast, we hope to maintain our culture of self direction, self empowerment and self development. With the backdrop of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&#34;&gt;equal salaries&lt;/a&gt;, I hope this paints a rough picture of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to work at iwantmyname. Flat hierarchy for us is a culture—an organic result of hiring the right people to do the right jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More on the subject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chuck Blakeman of Inc.com recently put out a great post titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inc.com/chuck-blakeman/4-steps-to-hiring-people-you-ll-never-have-to-manage.html?cid=sf01001&#34;&gt;How to Hire People You&amp;rsquo;ll Never Have to Manage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Included is a quote every company should remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to hire people you won&amp;rsquo;t have to manage, throw out most of what you&amp;rsquo;ve been taught about hiring. Hire first for Business Beliefs and Culture, second for talent, third for demonstrated skills, and use experience as a tiebreaker. You, and the people who you hire, will all be happier and more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Naming a website is hard—here are 6 tips to make it easier</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a random business owner or entrepreneur what the hardest part of their startup process was and you&amp;rsquo;ll likely hear &amp;ldquo;naming&amp;rdquo;. Naming your business, brand or simple blog can be extremely challenging because there&amp;rsquo;s no exact science or guaranteed process to lean on. It needs to be unique but uncomplicated, easy to say but different enough to separate you from the pack, and ultimately, it needs to embody your story. Or maybe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though—when you&amp;rsquo;re starting your naming process, you should always keep your domain name possibilities in mind. In this modern internet era, your website might just be your brand&amp;rsquo;s most public portal, so you need to make it count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quick tips to make your naming process a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t stray from your brand, especially for keyword stuffing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consumer, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to remember a site when the brand name doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the domain name. And you might think this is a common sense tip, but I see it all the time—especially with older sites trying to take advantage of keyword stuffing, an old SEO trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2014/01/15/domain-name-importance-in-ranking/&#34;&gt;From Duane Forrester &amp;ndash; Bing:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking today is a result of so many signals fed into the system the words used in a domain send less and less information into the stack as a percentage of overall decision making signals. This is great from our view (the engine) as it results in better results showing at the top since no one signal can be manipulated. From the searchers POV, it’s better simply because those sites trying to abuse their way to the top with a keyword rich domain and irrelevant or poor content cease to rank well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for practical purposes, if you&amp;rsquo;re a real estate agent, your top priority should be ease of discovery. If your brand is &amp;ldquo;The Hall Team&amp;rdquo;, thehallteam.com would be a much better choice than best-real-estate-wellington.com. And it&amp;rsquo;s not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s much easier now to make your name work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hangups in the past for naming is that brands felt like they were stuck with .COM as their only viable domain extension. And because .COM was (and still is) so crowded, you&amp;rsquo;ll often see companies use naming conventions like BRANDNAMEbrand.com, getBRANDNAME.com, or BRANDNAMEcompany.com just to make sure their brand name is in the domain somewhere. But from a consumer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, that&amp;rsquo;s really pretty confusing. When you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a brand on the internet, anything straying from BRANDNAME.EXTENSION seems like excess, and risks getting lost in the ether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) though, you can pair your brand name up with a memorable domain extension to create something easy to say, and even easier to remember. So instead of something like BRANDNAMEcoffeeroasters.com, you could just use BRANDNAME.coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Watch out when going too generic with gTLDs though&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of gTLDs opens you up to a lot of new naming possibilities, but remember that in search, you&amp;rsquo;re still going to be competing with existing brands. For instance, you might find joy in naming your apple orchard &amp;ldquo;Apple&amp;rdquo;, with the domain name, apple.farm, but you&amp;rsquo;re going to have some pretty fierce competition (apple.com, applerecords.com) for the top Google spot for the term &amp;ldquo;apple&amp;rdquo;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that you should always shy away from names because of search competition, but be smart about it. The goal is to be the number one search term for your brand name (at least), so if that&amp;rsquo;s impossible, you may want to reconsider your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Beware of alternative spellings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a quick look at the variety of names people come up with for brands, take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.producthunt.com/&#34;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll find countless brand names, many of which are derivations of simple words or phrases. And that&amp;rsquo;s fine, but you have to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The change should be noticeable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Taking a look at the Product Hunt list, the top hit at the time of writing is Humin, a cool new phonebook app. Its domain, humin.com, is obviously a derivation of the word &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s short enough that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t get too confused (although I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;d love to get their hands on human.com). Further down the list is a brand called Vint, which is also a a minor change, but is likely short enough for people to notice on first glance (although its domain name is joinvint.com, which I would say uses an unnecessary keyword).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain variations are normal in certain circles&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; While I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend a grocery store to change their name to &amp;ldquo;foodr&amp;rdquo;, adding or removing certain letters (usually vowels) is totally fine in some circles. Becomr.com is a good example from the Product Hunt list, because the tech crowd they&amp;rsquo;re aiming for is likely used to that sort of change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But other variations aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Every common derivation had to start somewhere, but I&amp;rsquo;d be wary of being too original. For example, I found a brand called Kalibrr, which changes &amp;ldquo;caliber&amp;rdquo; by replacing the &amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo; with a &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; and uses &amp;lsquo;rr&amp;rsquo; at the end. It could work out fine for them, but I&amp;rsquo;d guess there will be some recall issues down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A word about domain hacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&#34;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; a lot in the past, but for a brand&amp;rsquo;s primary site, they&amp;rsquo;re a hard sell for a couple reasons. First, they&amp;rsquo;re hard to verbalize. Instead of saying &amp;ldquo;BRANDNAME dot com&amp;rdquo;, you end up saying things like &amp;ldquo;BRANDNAME, with the end being dot I T&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;B R A N D N A dot M E&amp;rdquo;. Second, it&amp;rsquo;s only human nature to look at clever domain names as unprofessional. It certainly depends on the industry you&amp;rsquo;re in, but I&amp;rsquo;d think twice before putting my money in a bank using a domain like bankofthelak.es or bankingpl.us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more about you than the name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what I, or anyone, says about your domain name in the planning stages, the popularity of your brand will likely come down to your product and how well you market it. I&amp;rsquo;ll always remember thinking how odd the name Google was when I first heard it (it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html&#34;&gt;misspelling of googol&lt;/a&gt;), and we all know how that turned out. So be brave, be smart and whatever you do, don&amp;rsquo;t settle on something you&amp;rsquo;re not happy with. Think of your domain like a marriage—it&amp;rsquo;s a longterm commitment, and getting out will probably hurt quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gmail now recognizes addresses with accented and non-Latin characters</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-06-japanese-idn.png&#34; alt=&#34;Japanese IDN&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-first-step-toward-more-global-email.html&#34;&gt;From the Official Gmail Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, an organization called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a new email standard that supports addresses with non-Latin and accented Latin characters (e.g. 武＠メール.グーグル). In order for this standard to become a reality, every email provider and every website that asks you for your email address must adopt it. That’s obviously a tough hill to climb. The technology is there, but someone has to take the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re ready to be that someone. Starting now, Gmail (and shortly, Calendar) will recognize addresses that contain accented or non-Latin characters. This means Gmail users can send emails to, and receive emails from, people who have these characters in their email addresses. Of course, this is just a first step and there’s still a ways to go. In the future, we want to make it possible for you to use them to create Gmail accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hurdles for the adoption of non-Latin generic top-level domains (gTLDs) was the fact that their associated email addresses weren&amp;rsquo;t compatible with many of the most popular mail platforms. But now, with Gmail making the jump, we&amp;rsquo;re hopefully a few steps closer to a more welcoming web—one where characters from any language can be sent and recieved without hangups or restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A quick look at non-Latin gTLD popularity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because non-Latin gTLDs weren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to work in mail clients didn&amp;rsquo;t mean they weren&amp;rsquo;t popular though—four are currently sitting in the overall &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/&#34;&gt;top 100&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&#34;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt; at #9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&#34;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; at #18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA&#34;&gt;.みんな&lt;/a&gt; at #91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%95%86%E5%9F%8E&#34;&gt;.商城&lt;/a&gt; at #94&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see how much they grow in the following weeks after this announcement and the others that will hopefully follow. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised at all to see a non-Latin gTLD in the top-5 by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Create a self-hosted WordPress site with iwantmyname and Bluehost</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-05-bluehost-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bluehost&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s one piece of advice we could give to someone who is starting a website or blog, it&amp;rsquo;s that you should take some time to pick the right web platform for your needs. Some are great for blogging, some for e-commerce, some for being social. And there&amp;rsquo;s always the option of creating something entirely custom—although you&amp;rsquo;d either need some web development know-how or the resources to hire someone. Most sites though (including many of the biggest on the web) are created with one of the many platforms currently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For absolute beginners, we usually recommend a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&#34;&gt;hosted solution&lt;/a&gt;—the platforms that bundle modern content management systems (CMS) with hosting space. They can cost a bit more, and you&amp;rsquo;ll lose some development flexibility, but the benefits of using something that&amp;rsquo;s truly plug-and-play often outweigh the lack of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable managing your own hosting space, you&amp;rsquo;re open to a whole world of platforms that give you control over even the smallest details. And the most popular of these platforms is &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; (.org, not .com, which is a hosted platform), which in 2013 made up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/general-news/wordpress-infographic-2013-a-visual-representation-of-matts-state-of-the-word&#34;&gt;18.9%&lt;/a&gt; of the internet and was downloaded 46 million times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If WordPress is something you&amp;rsquo;re looking into, here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of how to link your iwantmyname domain to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/&#34;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt;, one of our favorite web hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab a domain at &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your domain is registered, select Setup in the top nav, then click &lt;em&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next to your domain, click the &lt;em&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/em&gt; link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Popular Settings&lt;/em&gt; dropdown menu, select &lt;em&gt;Bluehost&lt;/em&gt;, then click &lt;em&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/em&gt;. (Note: When you change your nameservers, one-click installs won&amp;rsquo;t work anymore. If you have any platforms currently installed like Bit.ly or Google Apps, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to reinstall those settings in your new Bluehost DNS manager.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-08-05-bluehost-ns.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bluehost NS&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;re setup on the iwantmyname end, head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/&#34;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt; (or directly to Bluehost&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname?page=/managed-wordpress-hosting&#34;&gt;WordPress Optimized Hosting&lt;/a&gt; page) to get your hosting space. From there, you&amp;rsquo;ll have access the &lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/home#main&#34;&gt;Bluehost admin page&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you easily install WordPress with your custom domain name. And that&amp;rsquo;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you need any additional help with the domain side of the equation, be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, the team at Bluehost should be able to answer any hosting-related questions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Searching for domains at iwantmyname just got a lot faster</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-30-new-search.png&#34; alt=&#34;new search&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You rarely think about the cogs that make things work when you&amp;rsquo;re browsing a site, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to direct your attention to our domain search—the big search bar on the homepage that lets you search for and buy domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept is a simple one. You type in a word, then our backend pings some servers and delivers a yes (available) or no (unavailable) for each top-level domain (TLD). A year ago, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t such a big deal to manage, but once the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) launched, the search quickly became a lumbering hulk. Every time you ran a search, hundreds of TLDs needed to be checked at once, and timeouts became more and more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of just waiting for our search to implode, we decided to completely rework the system. We&amp;rsquo;ll have a more technical post later on about what was accomplished, but the hyper-abridged version is that &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;the new search&lt;/a&gt; is much faster and infinitely more stable. And that&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful thing, because anything that gets in the way of you being able to register and manage domain names quickly is a big negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re so inclined, be sure to high-five &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kingersoll&#34;&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ferrouswheel&#34;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; for the update. They&amp;rsquo;re quite awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Watch Vint Cerf explain the NTIA transition (he rides a giant cat at the end)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We typically like to spare our customers the politics of the web, but Vint Cerf, the &amp;ldquo;father of the internet&amp;rdquo; (who now works for Google) recently narrated a great video explaining the transition of internet oversight from the influence of the NTIA (a US government organization) to the more global ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s short, educational, and has a great frame at 2:22 where a drawn depiction of Vint Cerf is sitting on top of a giant angry cat under a rainbow (I believe he just won the internet).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to build an audience for your website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that just buying a domain won&amp;rsquo;t magically make a website appear, getting your website online won&amp;rsquo;t magically make customers, audience, or community appear. As a side note, while SEO can be an important part of building your presence online, we&amp;rsquo;re not going to get into it in this post, as that&amp;rsquo;s a whole other big, complex topic. For an intro though, &lt;a href=&#34;http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo&#34;&gt;this is a great start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at some things to think about and research. We&amp;rsquo;ll also get into some actions to take to build your profile and engagement online and encourage people to visit your site. You could be trying to grow your customer base, build a community, or assemble an audience/fan base. People are people no matter how you&amp;rsquo;re interacting with them, so these tactics can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;What are you trying to build?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Who else is doing what you want to do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Create great content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;What are you trying to build?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like an obvious one, but there are often nuances. In the same way a startup&amp;rsquo;s target market isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;everyone&amp;rdquo;, neither is the target audience or community for your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People want it to be clear if they&amp;rsquo;re being sold something. They rarely like it if they think they&amp;rsquo;re just hanging out with friends&amp;hellip; and then get pitched. If you&amp;rsquo;re building a small business, great, be friendly and welcoming, but also keep in mind the things people want from a business website. That is, clear information about the products or services, pricing, shipping, ways to contact you, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to grow a community around a shared interest or other catalyst, you need to have a clear idea of who you want the community members to be. How will you design the site, functions, and onboarding process to make it as attractive to the right potential members as possible? If someone stumbles upon it expecting something entirely different they&amp;rsquo;re likely to end up frustrated, and it can be awkward for existing members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an audience, note that developing it can be quite different from building community, and is not intended to be fully interactive, but rather more broadcast-centric. Internet culture these days tends to be such that many people expect interactions to be inclusive (think Reddit or parenting blogger communities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop your personal or business brand and build an audience, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to think more along the lines of celebrities, athletes, etc. whose sites are developed more to broadcast and share information with their fans, but not necessarily to interact with them on a large scale. (Though many of these sites have fan community areas where fans can interact with each other.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Who else is doing what you want to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very unlikely that you are the first or only person doing what you want to do. (And if you are, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a good reason there aren&amp;rsquo;t others.) It may be a sparsely populated niche; it may be be well established and thriving. Do your research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know who the well-known names and established communities are. What are the sucessful brands? How do they approach and interact with others, and what do they focus on? What do they do that is popular and that you would like to do, too? (As the saying goes, good artists borrow, great artists steal&amp;hellip;) This is not to say that you should just copy wholesale what others are doing, but there are tried and true methods to build audience, sales, and community interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other big reasons to know who the other people in your area are is that one of the best ways to build your own presence is by getting out there. Interact with others and enhance their experience where you can. Don&amp;rsquo;t sit and wait for them to come to you. Join in, be part of existing communities. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to note where your target audience or community hangs out online. Not all groups use the same sites or tools, nor are all sites or tools well suited to all kinds of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is not to say you should just show up on others&amp;rsquo; sites, blogs, or forums and start spouting off about how great you are or your stuff is and how much everything else sucks and how they should all come to you. Remember, this is a social sphere like any other, and you&amp;rsquo;re the newcomer. Read, pay attention. Learn who the main players are, who the lurkers are, what topics are popular. Then, if there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to genuinely share an opinion or expertise, feel free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your contributions are useful and you&amp;rsquo;re pleasant and respectful, people will be interested in who you are, and may go check out your site or social profiles. Becoming part of a community (or the leader of one) or building a loyal customer base doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight. And particularly online, people don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be talked at or imposed upon. We all need to earn our places and prove our value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re starting a business, when you have great interactions with people who become fans, ask for testimonials you can showcase. If potential customers have trouble, ask what went wrong and how you can improve the experience. If you&amp;rsquo;re fortunate, they will become better evangelists for you than you can ever be for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Create great content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do get people interested in who you are and what you do, make sure to keep them interested when they come to check you out. Recall the answers you decided on about what you want to build. You need to have a site that welcomes visitors, tells them what they want to know, and encourages them to stay. That could include great blog posts/articles, sharing of practical information, or a user-friendly store offering great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your own site is only one part of showing who you are and what you can do online, but it is a big part, and it&amp;rsquo;s a part over which you have full control. (Unlike third-party sites/communities or social media.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, this is also one of the best SEO approaches as well. There is no button to click or form on which to submit your site to get great results in Google and other searches. But creating great content and building a site that people like using and coming back to will help you rise in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there&amp;rsquo;s no ideal solution for building an online presence, audience, or community that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require time, hard work, and paying attention to the world around you. But putting in the effort &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; pay off. No one owes you their attention online, so remembering how you like to experience sites and interact with people and doing your best to replicate and improve upon that is a great set of first steps. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;And, of course, registering a great domain name.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>6 tips for choosing a domain name for fundraising</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.donationto.com/&#34;&gt;DonationTo&lt;/a&gt; is an easy-to-use fundraising website that has &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/register-domain-donationto&#34;&gt;integrated with iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy to use personalized domain names when crowd-funding online. The method is rather easy—it takes just five minutes to create a fundraising page at DonationTo and just a few moments more to purchase and plug in your domain name with iwantmyname. And by the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a great, easy-to-remember domain such as &amp;lsquo;james-fighting-cancer.com&amp;rsquo; as your hub for accepting donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons to use personal domain names for crowd-funding pages, first of which is the fact that they make it easier for supporters to draw connections between who you are (friend/family) and what they are supposed to do (donate). After all, it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that many people will not immediately visit your page, so you&amp;rsquo;ll want to provide them with a relevant domain name that&amp;rsquo;s easy to remember for future reference. Taking this approach will help increase the total amount of contributions you&amp;rsquo;ll receive, and will help show your commitment to hitting your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major benefit of attaching a custom domain name to your crowd-funding page is that it will build legitimacy for your cause. People are exposed to hundreds of online fundraising campaigns each year, so you should take every possible step to make it yours a trusted option for them to financially support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the right domain name can be intimidating for some people though, so we&amp;rsquo;ve compiled a list of proven tips that will help you get the most out of the name you choose to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Selecting the correct domain extension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you begin contemplating what your online fundraising domain name will be, you need to choose the domain extension (.net, .com, .io, .org, etc.) that makes the most sense for your particular cause. Although most people automatically assume that .com makes the most sense, this is not always the case. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re hosting a fundraiser specifically for a cause based in Japan, it could be beneficial to add a local touch by selecting the .jp domain extension. After all, going with a country-specific domain name may help capture the attention of local supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your fundraiser has global appeal, it could be wise to choose .com or a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;generic top-level domain&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see, there&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot to think about before you lock yourself into any specific domain extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to note about extensions is that they can alter a potential supporter&amp;rsquo;s perception of your efforts to crowd-fund. For instance, while .com has become synonymous with almost any type of website, the reality is that it was created for sites of a more business nature (com stands for commercial), whereas the original purpose of .org was to provide a resource for organizations—often nonprofits. Due to this, .org might be more appealing for some charity campaigns, but you should still carefully consider utilizing .com because it may be easier for some people to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Choosing your domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy for people to become overwhelmed with all the potential
possibilities, but there is a very simple way for most to settle on a name that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your domain name should be your company name.&amp;rdquo; Christopher Heng from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/domainname.shtml&#34;&gt;thesitewizard.com&lt;/a&gt; explains that while naming domains after company names may seem obvious to some, a surprising amount of domains aren&amp;rsquo;t correlated at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, how confusing it would be if your nonprofit was known by a name that was completely different from your domain name. It would be much harder to reach from memory, and would likely prevent people from visiting the site at all. And that, in turn, could make overall donations suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important reminder is that you want search engines to be on your side. If you&amp;rsquo;re a nonprofit organization, supporters are going to look to make online donations by entering your organization&amp;rsquo;s name into their favorite search engine. But if your organization&amp;rsquo;s name and your domain name aren&amp;rsquo;t related, search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo might not be able to link to the appropriate content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Choosing a name without an organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people worldwide crowd-funding for a variety of reasons—medical, memorial, natural disasters—and many of them aren&amp;rsquo;t associated with any specific organization. If this is the case for your campaign, it may seem daunting to pick an appropriate domain name. However, there is a simple process to help you land on a name that will be easy for supporters to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tip is to use your domain name to tell people who you are and what you&amp;rsquo;re raising money for. For example, if you have a friend named James who is currently fighting cancer, james-fighting-cancer.com would be a good choice. Anyone who knows James will draw the connection—this donation is for James, and the money will go towards his medical bills to fight cancer. It&amp;rsquo;s this logical process we&amp;rsquo;re looking to achieve, and it can be all done with a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point to note is the use of hyphens in the domain name above (james-fighting-cancer.com). While some may question the use of hyphens, our experience indicates that they can actually add much-needed clarity. As an added bonus, choosing longer domains  such as james-fighting-cancer.com or james-medical-fundraising.com are much more likely to be available (buying domains that are already registered can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html&#34;&gt;quite expensive&lt;/a&gt;), and are extremely easy to read and remember. And from a search engine perspective, hyphens are ok because they&amp;rsquo;re just treated as spaces between words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tip is to think about specificity. If you choose to use a longer domain, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s as precise as possible. For instance, james-fighting-cancer.com is good, but maybe james-medical-fundraising.com would add an extra layer of specificity. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to be very up front with your needs, and james-medical-fundraising.com clearly spells out the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re raising money for James&amp;rsquo; medical bills. Choosing the right words will vary from case to case, so use your best judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Keep it simple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous tip we explained that it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to utilize hyphens for clarity in your domain name, however, there is the danger of incorporating &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt; words or hyphens. Typically more than three hyphens will confuse your visitors, and even if you choose not use hyphens, that amount of words strung together can be confusing to read and even harder to memorize. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to note that domain names that are more than four words long run the risk of being cut off by link services like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best bet is to stick with a name that utilizes three or fewer words and hyphens. And if you follow the adage of keeping it simple, you&amp;rsquo;ll never need to worry about character limits or domains that are too hard to memorize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Oversimplification is bad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve touched base on the importance of keeping your domain name simple, you might be thinking about doing things that could actually hurt your goal. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s critical to learn the difference between a simple domain name and an oversimplified one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your friend goes by the name DJ, it would make perfect sense to choose dj-medical-fundraising.com as your domain name. However, it would be an oversimplification to select DJMF.com, as this has no easily discernible meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trend that you may want to avoid is choosing a country extension in order to make a creative word. For example, it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2008/10/23/how-to-get-yourself-a-sweet-ly-domain-name/&#34;&gt;used to be popular&lt;/a&gt; to choose an English word then add .ly at the end such as useful.ly, but the practice has fallen out of favor recently because it&amp;rsquo;s generally harder to verbalize these &amp;ldquo;domain hacks,&amp;rdquo; and because they&amp;rsquo;re unusual, they can be more difficult to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that keeping it simple without oversimplifying, using so-called cute wordplay or being overly clever is always the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. The decision of whether or not to use numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is typically suggested that numbers should not be incorporated into domain names, but there are some compelling arguments for them. For example, the Internet provides access to the entire world, and numbers are often used to convey meaning in other languages (like Chinese, as highlighted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFTW_abinnM&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;). Another good use of numbers to increase specificity without using too many characters—like if you&amp;rsquo;re raising money to pay for an 88th birthday party. Spelling out 88 would make your domain name unnecessarily long and would most likely confuse people, so choosing something like james-88th-birthday.com or james-88th-fundraiser.com would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember to use common sense when determining if numbers are appropriate for your domain. If they&amp;rsquo;re culturally relevant or make things more specific, they may indeed be helpful for people trying to find your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online fundraising is rather popular today, and with DonationTo you can get your fundraising page up in just a few minutes. And with an iwantmyname domain name, the whole process is easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you make your selection, follow our six tips to point you in the right direction for clarity and legibility as you share your domain name across email and all your social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A look at the most popular sites using new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new generic-top level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) have been a moderate success up to this point. If you take a look at ntldstat.com&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/&#34;&gt;new gTLD registrations chart&lt;/a&gt;, you won&amp;rsquo;t find dramatic gains, but the line is consistently trending upwards with more gTLDs coming out each week. And that&amp;rsquo;s not likely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point though, the success of the new gTLDs won&amp;rsquo;t be determined by numbers (numbers can be skewed), but by visibility. Specifically, by the amount of big sites that use gTLDs as their primary internet outposts. So while we wait for BMW.com to become BMW.auto, we can hold ourselves over with Domain Incite Pro&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/pro/popular-new-gtld-domains/&#34;&gt;newly released feature&lt;/a&gt; that tracks sites using new gTLDs by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alexa.com/topsites&#34;&gt;Alexa Rank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;rsquo;t any sites using gTLDs in the Alexa top 500 yet, but there are 34 in the top 100,000 (which is a big deal considering the new domain extensions are still fairly new). I won&amp;rsquo;t list them out individually (some could be malicious), but breaking them out by gTLD shows some pretty interesting trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alexa top 100,000 distribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&#34;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&#34;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt; 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land&#34;&gt;.LAND&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&#34;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ninja&#34;&gt;.NINJA&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&#34;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&#34;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center&#34;&gt;.CENTER&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&#34;&gt;.DIRECTORY&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics&#34;&gt;.GRAPHICS&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&#34;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-marketing&#34;&gt;.MARKETING&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&#34;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-trade&#34;&gt;.TRADE&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&#34;&gt;.XYZ&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-zone&#34;&gt;.ZONE&lt;/a&gt; 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorter TLDs seem to be doing much better than longer ones (which makes sense), with only five of the top 34 having more than a five-letter domain extension. If this trend holds, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bode well for the longer gTLDs yet to come out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.XYZ, the top gTLD in overall registrations, only appears once in the Alexa top 100,000. Given its relative newness, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t come as too much of a surprise, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know what percentage of its 300,000+ applications are just junk to inflate stats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CLUB has been quite aggressive with their marketing (in certain circles), and it&amp;rsquo;s paid off, making up more than 25% of the list. Poor 50 Cent&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://50inda.club/&#34;&gt;50inda.club&lt;/a&gt; site didn&amp;rsquo;t make the Alexa top million though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.GURU was the leader on the overall popularity list for a good amount of time (it&amp;rsquo;s currently in fourth), but only one of its sites made the list. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s the most popular site on the Alexa list at #710, but I do wonder how popular .GURU will be once the initial popularity wears off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The general thought is that if gTLDs are ever going to become truly popular, more than one will have to hit it big. And with 16 different domain extensions on the list, the popularity is spread out pretty evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>Web platforms and naming tips for building amazing restaurant sites (updated!)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a restaurant is a hard business, and as more and more customers choose to dine at places with good design aesthetics, it&amp;rsquo;s become increasingly important to have a similarly beautiful website. But going with an agency or freelancer to build your site can be quite expensive, so it may be wise to make your site yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately we&amp;rsquo;re not living in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s, a time when cheesy Flash site creators using animated banners were all the rage. The web platforms of today can help even the most novice restauranteurs create slick, responsive sites with integrated social platforms and menu systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to make things easy, here are four modern platforms from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;one-click marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, as well as a batch of great naming suggestions to make your site as easy to find as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discoverability is all in a name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the perfect domain name can be just as important as building a great site. And if you only take one thing from this post, it should be that &lt;strong&gt;your domain name should be the same as your company name&lt;/strong&gt;. Most restaurants will likely try to grab a .com first, but don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice memorability just so you can have a specific domain extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your company name is Bar Chris (and barchris.com is taken), don&amp;rsquo;t register something like barchrisyum.com just to be in the .com namespace. It&amp;rsquo;ll just confuse people—and besides, there are so many great alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 1: Look for something local&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;re in the US, country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are extremely popular and can significantly open up your naming options. For instance, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to open a bakery in Canada, you may find it easier to find a short, descriptive domain in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada&#34;&gt;.ca&lt;/a&gt; namespace than .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 2: Even local-er&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more direct that the ccTLDs are the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/cities-are-a-good-bet-for-new-domain-extension-success.html&#34;&gt;city domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to be careful not to put yourself in too much of a box, but if you&amp;rsquo;re not looking to expand to other cities (or you plan on registering in each new city you move to), there are a bunch of great cities with their own TLDs now. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc&#34;&gt;.NYC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-paris&#34;&gt;.Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london&#34;&gt;.London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-moscow&#34;&gt;.Moscow&lt;/a&gt;—the list goes on and on, and more cities will surely be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Option 3: Try a generic term&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third option is to do away with localization altogether, and instead move to a TLD that better categorizes your domain on the web. Just as .com stands for commercial, these domain extensions actually mean something—and they can be a benefit for domain recall (BOBSPIZZA.london might not stick, but BOBS.pizza is nice and memorable):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pub&#34;&gt;.PUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bar&#34;&gt;.BAR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rest&#34;&gt;.REST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cafe&#34;&gt;.CAFE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-eat&#34;&gt;.EAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-food&#34;&gt;.FOOD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kitchen&#34;&gt;.KITCHEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza&#34;&gt;.PIZZA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 DIY platforms for building your site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your name in place, here are some nice platforms to try out. All offer modern templates and great features, and are perfect for people with little-to-no development knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squarespace.com/tour/restaurants&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Say goodbye to Flash websites and PDF menus. Squarespace makes exceptional design and modern functionality available to all restaurants. Best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of cake to update yourself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace does a lot right with its simple website template system. With no design or development skill, you can create a responsive site (meaning it resizes automatically for any screen size) with beautiful photography, a great menu system, OpenTable integration, social connections and even an online sales platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-10-squarespace-restaurant.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Squarespace&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://virb.com/restaurants&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Virb makes it easy to serve up a great website for your hungry guests, with simple tools and features to keep up with your fast-moving world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Squarespace, Virb is a comprehensive site builder that has entered the restaurant market in a big way. With no dev background, you get a number of beautiful templates with menu systems, contact pages, social integrations and OpenTable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-10-virb-restaurant.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Virb&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/site-hungry-for-restaurants&#34;&gt;Site Hungry&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://sitehungry.com/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Site Hungry allows you to set up a brand new restaurant website in less than 5 minutes. Share all of your restaurant&amp;rsquo;s hours, location and contact information, menu, and social media in one place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Squarespace and Virb, the Site Hungry platform is 100% dedicated to building restaurant sites. And as far as ease of use goes, it may be the easiest to get up and running. The platform doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite have the full feature-set of the bigger, more established platforms yet, but I&amp;rsquo;d expect steady growth as the user-base grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/custom-domain-letseatat&#34;&gt;LetsEat&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.letseat.at/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s Eat is made for busy people who want to update their menu specials on the fly, not deal with HTML and JavaScript. It is an advanced restaurant website builder that doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a steep learning curve.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LetsEat is another restaurant-only platform that integrates menus, photography and social together to create clean, simple sites. But the differentiator for LetsEat is its &amp;ldquo;app store.&amp;rdquo; With little effort, you can integrate services like OpenTable, Constant Contact, OpenDining, Taskvilla and SeatMe to create exactly the site you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-10-letseat-restaurant.png&#34; alt=&#34;LetsEat&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>John O&#39;Nolan has some tips for overcoming blogger&#39;s block</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging has gotten a bad rap over the last few years because the medium is inundated with so much noise. But starting and maintaining a good (i.e. useful) blog takes an amazing amount of dedication to a very specific window of interest, which is why it&amp;rsquo;s so rare to see blogs that are more than a year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to staying engaged with a specific topic is to always have something to say, and for that, we have a great post from John O&amp;rsquo;Nolan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ghost.org/great-blog-post-ideas/&#34;&gt;How To Come up with Great Ideas for Blog Posts, Every Single Time&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I write about now? What do I have to say that&amp;rsquo;s important enough to be worth publishing? Will anyone even care? This isn&amp;rsquo;t working. I&amp;rsquo;ll try again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thinking often forces us to repress ideas and throw them into the &amp;ldquo;not worth publishing&amp;rdquo; bucket. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame, because it stifles creativity. This is why we&amp;rsquo;re often left staring at computer screens knowing that we should publish something, but unable to decide on exactly what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this: Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at some tried and tested techniques for coming up with blog post ideas even when you feel like you&amp;rsquo;ve got no creativity left to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piggybacking on this topic, another great post strategy is to send people to useful articles other people have written (how meta&amp;hellip;a blog post highlighting a blog post about blogging!). There&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no shame in becoming a trusted resource for finding other trusted resources.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Build a modern, hosted photo gallery website for under $10 a month</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big life events tend to be accompanied by countless images of every important moment, but in today&amp;rsquo;s digital world, what happens after that? You&amp;rsquo;re probably not going to print them all for a book, and uploading them all to large photo-storage sites seems rather impersonal. For photos like these, you need something you can customize to fit your style without any sort of platform branding slapped on top, with optional password protection for privacy if you need it. And of course it shoud also work with your very own custom domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are a ton of great options available. Some edgy and modern, and some more flexible and subdued. And best of all, they&amp;rsquo;re not going to cost you a fortune to maintain. For $10 USD or less, you can create something quite amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SmugMug&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/own-domain-on-smugmug-portfolio&#34;&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt; was built for preserving your digital photos on a nice, clean website. And it goes above and beyond to make sharing easy, with simple downloads, social connectivity and a platform to turn photos into prints or products for easy gifting. If you &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smugmug.com/features&#34;&gt;bill annually&lt;/a&gt;, the Power tier is only $5/mo billed annually, and gives you unlimited photo uploads and design control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-10-smugmug-template.png&#34; alt=&#34;SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image credit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://nicolesyblog.com/2013/07/31/the-new-smugmug/&#34;&gt;Nicolesy Blog&lt;/a&gt;, which also has a nice description of the changes SmugMug made from their old platform to their new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zenfolio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/zenfolio-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Zenfolio&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more well known photography specific platforms, and was built &amp;ldquo;for photographers – both amateur and professional – to organize, display, and sell their images with uncompromising quality.&amp;rdquo; To use your own domain name you&amp;rsquo;ll need the Unlimited &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.zenfolio.com/zf/signup/plans.aspx&#34;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;, which offers unlimited storage for $5/mo billed annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-10-zenfolio-template.png&#34; alt=&#34;Zenfolio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/4ormat-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Format&lt;/a&gt; (which recently changed from 4ormat) is billed as a site for creative professionals to build an online portfolio, but its clean templates, flexible pages and slick blog integration makes it a wonderful option for amateur photographers and adventurers. Basic &lt;a href=&#34;http://format.com/plans&#34;&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; are $5.75/mo billed annually, and give you 50 pages, 100 images and 100 videos to play around with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-10-format.png&#34; alt=&#34;Format&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Salon.io&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/domain-customize-salonio&#34;&gt;Salon.io&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely unique platform, as it gives you control of your layout like none other. You start with a completely blank canvas (no templates), then add in photos and videos and embeds in fixed width, variable size or completely user-controlled grids. The Basic &lt;a href=&#34;http://salon.io/join&#34;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; includes everything most users will need (10 pages, 500 images), and costs 29€ for a lifetime membership (no recurring payments!), but to get password protection you&amp;rsquo;ll need the Easy Business plan, which is 99€/year, slightly above the $10/mo threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exposure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/exposure-photo-websites&#34;&gt;Exposure&lt;/a&gt; is a bit different than the standard photo gallery platform—it&amp;rsquo;s meant to give people the chance to weave photos into a narrative. To turn your grand adventures into something more than just a collection of photos with no context. &lt;a href=&#34;https://exposure.co/subscribe&#34;&gt;Prices&lt;/a&gt; are hard to find before you sign up, but maintaining a Pro account (which give you custom domain support) costs $8.25/mo if billed annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Squarespace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; has been around for quite a while in web years, and now in its sixth iteration, it&amp;rsquo;s become one of the web&amp;rsquo;s leading platforms for creating striking sites with minimal effort. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/&#34;&gt;Plans&lt;/a&gt; with unlimited storage start at $16/mo if billed annually, but the $8/mo annual plan has plenty of space for most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-10-squarespace-template.png&#34; alt=&#34;Squarespace&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Virb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Virb&lt;/a&gt; is a versatile platform for all kinds of websites, but one of its best features is how its templates beautifully display photos. And Virb &lt;a href=&#34;http://virb.com/pricing&#34;&gt;makes pricing easy&lt;/a&gt;, with unlimited everything, including pages, photos and customization options for a flat $10/mo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-09-virb-template.png&#34; alt=&#34;Virb&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;500px&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio/500px-custom-domain-registration&#34;&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional photo gallery site—it&amp;rsquo;s more of a social network for discovering great photography. And it&amp;rsquo;s really awesome if that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, but for traditional photo galleries it may have been a bit much. Before you decide, take a look at what the platform offers, as well as the &amp;ldquo;Awesome&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://500px.com/upgrade&#34;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you the ability to create your own site within the 500px community for $6.25/mo billed annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-07-10-500px-template.png&#34; alt=&#34;500px&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to manage your brand&#39;s reputation on the web</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re exposed. Most likely, at least. If your brand is on the web, it&amp;rsquo;s open to criticism from every direction—and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing you can do about it. Some people handle this burden with grace, but we&amp;rsquo;ve seen enough disaster stories to know what happens when things go wrong. If you&amp;rsquo;re part of a company or organization and concerned about reviews for your products or services, here are some tips for making the best of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Approach it with the right perspective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Questions to ask before getting started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t sharecrop, register a domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Monitor, engage, and converse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;How to make your site a really useful destination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;Be the master of your own domain(s)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-7&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ok to have fun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Approach it with the right perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many misguided companies have learned, no one controls the Internet, or how people act or what is posted on it. You only control what you post and how you respond to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be able to prevent people from expressing themselves on your company&amp;rsquo;s website or social media properties, but if they&amp;rsquo;re upset about something, that just means they&amp;rsquo;ll go elsewhere to do it. And hey, there&amp;rsquo;s a whole new world of &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; or, coming soon &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.sucks&lt;/em&gt; out there these days. A better focus would be on not needing to try and bury the bad reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing to understand is that no matter how hard-working and well-meaning a company is, eventually everyone has a misstep or customer who they just can&amp;rsquo;t make happy. The question is how to address it, turn it around if possible, and keep the negative comments off the first page of search results or Buzzfeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Questions to ask before getting started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the best ways to create a good balance? How can you publicize all your happy customers, your awesome products and services, and your stellar customer service, while still addressing real issues? While keeping in mind, of course, that there are people who are only &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo; when they&amp;rsquo;re trashing others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, ensure you have a solid policy in place before embarking on the great adventure that is the Internet. Some questions you&amp;rsquo;ll need to answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your company doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a website, what domain(s) will you choose? (What&amp;rsquo;s available, memorable, and best reflects your business, products, services, or culture?) With &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions_&#34;&gt;all the new gTLDs available and yet to be launched&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s more choice than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On what sites will you have a presence? (I.e. where will you create your company&amp;rsquo;s own accounts/sites/properties.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the common terms that people might use to look for or talk about your company or products? (These should include both the official nomenclature of your company, and words and phrases that customers and others use.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On what sites will you engage with customers, prospects, and others? (This means both your own properties and other third-party sites and accounts where others may be talking about you.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kinds of content will you post?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the content you post differ by property, audience, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via what channels do you want people to contact your company? (E.g. email, phone, chat, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via what channels will you offer support? (If you choose not to support a common channel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/its-not-that-your-call-isnt-important-to-us.html&#34;&gt;like the phone&lt;/a&gt;, make that very public and clear and make it easy to contact your company in other ways.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is going to have access to post content and respond to others who engage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your standard policy regarding complaints? (Be familiar with and clear on legitimate complaints or criticisms and trolling.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When do you respond to complaints and when do you ignore them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your escalation policy regarding complaints?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your timeline for responding to people, whether it&amp;rsquo;s comments, questions, or complaints? (On the Internet, you can never respond &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your policy regarding unfounded complaints? These can include, but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to people who are&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spreading misinformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have never been customers and are just ranting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are secretly competitors trying to make the competition look bad (as a general rule, never talk about the competition, especially to bad mouth them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are trying to spread hate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;may not be mentally stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are angry for reasons beyond your control, like your company simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t do something they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your company should have a solid understanding and policy for all of these things before engaging online, else you&amp;rsquo;re likely to find yourself scrambling when something goes wrong some day. This could happen when your company screws something up, when there&amp;rsquo;s big (bad) news in your industry, or for many other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Don&#39;t sharecrop, register a domain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as social media has become pretty thoroughly integrated into consumers&amp;rsquo; and companies&amp;rsquo; online experiences, it&amp;rsquo;s still a good idea to have your own web properties. Certainly you can brand and monitor third-party sites, but having your own provides your company with a solid and centralized online identity. (&amp;ldquo;Sharecropping&amp;rdquo; refers to relying on third-party services, platforms, and companies you don&amp;rsquo;t own or control for functions that are essential to your business.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides a destination with your branding, correct and comprehensive information about your company, and a single location to receive questions, comments, and concerns (and potentially post replies). These days plenty of people are reticent to do business with a company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a website, since it seems a bit sketchy. &lt;em&gt;Who are they, really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, registering your own domains and either creating sites or directing them to relevant existing properties is a good idea. (And yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/small-businesses-without-a-web-presence-are-missing-out.html&#34;&gt;many small businesses still don&amp;rsquo;t have a web presence&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Monitor, engage, and converse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping a close eye on your own online properties, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to set up social media, blog, and news alerts for those aforementioned terms (the ones your company uses and the ones others use) to enable good awareness and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On third party sites on which you participate, like social media, make sure that people are actively monitoring them if people choose those avenues to contact you. People will almost always try to contact you by the ways they&amp;rsquo;re familiar with, rather than whatever your company might prefer. If your audience or customer base is on Twitter, then you&amp;rsquo;d better be, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also be aware of how much you &amp;ldquo;broadcast&amp;rdquo;. That might seem odd, given I just recommended having policies for what, where, and how much you post. But note that Internet culture doesn&amp;rsquo;t tend to be a fan of companies having exclusively a &amp;ldquo;me, me, me&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, people want it to be easy to get information and answers about you and your products. But that&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; they want from you. They also don&amp;rsquo;t want to be asked for things or told to do things that are clearly only going to benefit your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to be heard, and to be able to have a conversation with you (when &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want one), and know that their concerns are being listened to and that their problems get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;How to make your site a really useful destination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So looking at your company&amp;rsquo;s own web properties, how should you handle those with respect to customer reviews and feedback? Well, ideally your company and its representatives don&amp;rsquo;t suck very often, and so people don&amp;rsquo;t have much reason to go looking for &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.sucks&lt;/em&gt; to vent their spleens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your company&amp;rsquo;s main website, be it &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.com&lt;/em&gt;, .BIZ, .IO, or other TLD variant, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s clear and easy for anyone to contact you. When someone is frustrated, not being able to find out how to get help or give feedback is only going to make people more upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include plenty of links to your &lt;em&gt;help@yourcompany.com&lt;/em&gt; email address or contact form, a feedback button on every page, etc. Think of the places you go on sites to find that kind of information, and then make sure it&amp;rsquo;s there. (And in places where people look that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have occurred to you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;Be the master of your own domain(s)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable your company to have input and the ability to manage review-related sites about your company, you may want to register relevant domains yourself, before someone else does. This way you can manage what information is available there. Even if you think all your customers love you, it won&amp;rsquo;t hurt to register &lt;em&gt;yourcompanyreviews.com&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yourcompany.reviews&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; or similar domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to create websites for any or all of those. You could have the domains forward to your main website&amp;rsquo;s support section, customer forums, or other relevant location where people can give feedback, ask questions or express frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-7&#34;&gt;It&#39;s ok to have fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re really confident in your brand, customer service, culture, and customer base, you could approach things with a sense of humour (and bravery) and create a website at &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; where you actually welcome complaints. (And will also be including info about what you did about those complaints, e.g. linking to fixed issues, new features, etc.) Kind of like when celebrities read mean tweets or post hate mail on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do so, however, ensure that you have dedicated staff to monitor the site, respond, and who have enough agency to actually &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; people. If they&amp;rsquo;re going to go to &lt;em&gt;yourcompanysucks.com&lt;/em&gt; you need to make sure their next stop after that is &lt;em&gt;yourcompanyrocks.com&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this is a one-time project. Building a presence, reputation, and community online takes time, effort, and long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A new generic top-level domain hits 250,000 registrations</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some perspective. In order for the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to become mainstream, there needs to be a rapid rise in popularity. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/&#34;&gt;1.4 million total registrations&lt;/a&gt; is a nice start (the new gTLD are only a few months old), but .com has 100 million domains under its umbrella. It&amp;rsquo;s so big, in fact, that .com is synonymous with the internet for much of the world—but it may not always be that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&#34;&gt;.Xyz&lt;/a&gt;, billed as the natural ending for everything (because it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the alphabet), has hit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/tld/xyz&#34;&gt;250,000 domains registered mark&lt;/a&gt;, now making up nearly 18% of all the new gTLDs in existance. There have been some pretty egregious instances of stat manipulation, but looking at the bigger picture, the rise of .xyz (and the fact that people are talking about it) makes it seem possible for a number of these gTLDs to catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New gTLDs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app&#34;&gt;.app&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&#34;&gt;.blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-web&#34;&gt;.web&lt;/a&gt; are surefire hits that haven&amp;rsquo;t come out yet, and the growing popularity of city gTLDs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo&#34;&gt;.tokyo&lt;/a&gt; are hopefully indicators of upcoming successes. The dream of seeing new gTLDs on billboards and ads and shows is still very much alive, it&amp;rsquo;s just going to take some time—and .xyz&amp;rsquo;s 250,000 is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname culture: The &#34;work-from-anywhere experiment&#34;</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last post I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one.html&#34;&gt;one salary experiment&lt;/a&gt; and got a lot of feedback. One point that kept coming up was that we may run into the problem of a limited talent pool as we have no real way of attracting anyone with a higher salary than we currently pay. While this may be a limiting factor, the salary is only one aspect of working at iwantmyname. Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about a second aspect, one that also addresses our talent pool size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a company built on the idea that we want to be able to work from anywhere, and because we&amp;rsquo;re an Internet-based business, we have no need for a fixed location. We work on a global network, and as long as we have access to it, we can be productive. And we&amp;rsquo;re not alone in this—&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.groovehq.com/blog/being-a-remote-team&#34;&gt;quite a few startups have shifted to working either entirely as a distributed team&lt;/a&gt; or with remote workers who contribute. But we, as with many things, try to push this envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love camping, and here in New Zealand it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to take your work outside. The wireless coverage you can get across large parts of the country enables me to camp out on remote beaches for days and work from there. This, for me, is the ultimate work/life balance. But not all of us like camping, and even I don&amp;rsquo;t live in a camper all the time, so we regularly have people working from home, co-working spaces or the office in Wellington. We have no policy on where you have to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For half of this year I&amp;rsquo;ll be living in Berlin, working out of a co-working space and connecting with the startup community in Europe. Many of us love traveling, and the company setup we have enables everyone to do that. We have team members that travel for half the year and are back in Wellington for the rest, we have people that work from Canada and the US most of the time, while others are mainly in Wellington. The freedom of choice and the opportunity to set your schedule as you please brings us very close to &amp;ldquo;work whenever you want from wherever you want&amp;rdquo; dream. The only really fixed thing at iwantmyname is our weekly meeting. Once a week we all meet either in person in the office or via video link for everyone who is remote and talk about what we&amp;rsquo;re working on, what we plan to do next, where we are and how we feel. This weekly chat where everyone sees each other is the only time where everyone makes an effort to be at a place where the internet is good enough for video chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are limits to this. There has to be at least one developer on call with internet access &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in case things go wrong. There also needs to be at least one supporter that looks after our customers&amp;rsquo; needs at any time, and so on. But, with everyone working pretty closely with everyone else, we know when someone needs a break, is working from a country where internet coverage is bad, or if part of the team is at Burning Man and has no internet at all. It all comes down to communication with the team and respectful planning. So the above &amp;ldquo;work whenever you want from wherever you want&amp;rdquo; has, in reality, a qualifier of &amp;ldquo;as long as you respect the team and our customers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the remote work opportunities, why then do we have an office at all? Turns out, having an office is awesome. You can hang out together if you want. Chat, have fun. An office is a very social place, and even though I&amp;rsquo;m often most productive when I work from home, time in the office is important when we collaborate to develop new features. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good place for Friday drinks when we have other startups over or host user groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having fun is an integral part of what we do at iwantmyname. Having fun makes sure our product is built by a team that likes doing what they do. In my opinion, working only for the sake of making money makes work a sad place. If financial incentives are the only reason you work where you work, then the products that come out are artifacts of people trying to drop the keyboard at 5pm to do fun things. I can&amp;rsquo;t see those being products that will be fun for people to use. And this puts a much different perspective on the talent pool we draw from.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Philippines disaster, six months downstream</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may recall that we &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&#34;&gt;made a commitment&lt;/a&gt; last year to contribute a portion of our earnings towards charitable purposes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html&#34;&gt;Typhoon Haiyan&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most powerful tropical storms in recorded history and led to over 6,000 deaths when it struck the Philippines in November 2013. With the island nation sitting near our own back doorstep in Asia-Pacific, it was not a difficult choice where to spend the money this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked really hard at the many aid agencies working in the region and weighed up a number of indices demonstrating effectiveness. In the end we invested via Save The Children and specifically asked that the donation go towards recovery operations in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months on from the disaster it has been heart-warming to observe media coverage of how emergency aid agencies have been helping the people of the affected region get their lives back on track. Food, water, medical supplies, housing, sanitation, communications—the list of needs is endless. Thank-you for supporting iwantmyname, so that we could make a small contribution to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An introduction to Postach.io with @nerdburn</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog platforms come in all shapes and sizes, but some of the more interesting platforms today are the ones that work without traditional hosting space. And with Evernote recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/05/13/evernote-reaches-100-million-users/&#34;&gt;topping 100 million users&lt;/a&gt;, we thought it&amp;rsquo;d be the perfect time to ask cofounder &lt;a href=&#34;http://nerdburn.com/&#34;&gt;Shawn Adrian&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nerdburn&#34;&gt;@nerdburn&lt;/a&gt;) about his Evernote-powered blog platform, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postachio&#34;&gt;Postach.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the million dollar question. How does Postach.io/Evernote blogging work? Is it easy to make a site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Our whole goal with creating Postach.io was, and still is, to make web publishing easy, with fewer steps. From the feedback we’re getting from people I think we’re on the right track. People love the simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a site, you simply connect your Evernote account, choose a site name, then tag content “published” in Evernote to post to it. It literally takes only couple of minutes to be blogging, quite professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What does a Postach.io site look like? Are there themes? Do I need to know any code or anything to change things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; You can check out a bunch of Postach.io sites by visiting our &lt;a href=&#34;http://postach.io/discover&#34;&gt;Discover feed&lt;/a&gt;—although we need to work on the algorithm that brings interesting content to the top, you’ll see a variety of sites on Discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently have 13 themes, and all are fully responsive for web and mobile. Right now, to create a theme you need to know HTML and CSS, but we’re working on making it much easier to customize the presentation without code knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there any disadvantage to Postach.io in terms or SEO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Nope, in fact, our customers have shared that by using Postach.io they’ve seen more traffic to their blog posts than before they migrated over. We’ve done a lot to ensure we’re coding our themes according to latest best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of related to SEO, are there any speed concerns with Postach.io? Is it as fast as a traditional blog hosting platform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Feel free to test it! One of our secret fetishes here is building scalable apps. It&amp;rsquo;s a thrill to get hit with a bomb of traffic then see the server handle it without a hiccup. What a rush! We’re confident that Postach.io sites stand up to the best of them when talking about speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Since Postach.io works in Evernote, can I bring in things like social integrations, analytics platforms and comment systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; We have a ton of integrations and embeds, but we’re working on more as well. In the coming months you’re going to see even deeper integrations to popular platforms—currently we support Google Analytics, Disqus commenting, SoundCloud, YouTube, Vimeo, Mathjax, Gist, Slideshare and a bunch of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt;  So the Postach.io &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.postach.io/postach-io-premium-announcement&#34;&gt;premium tier&lt;/a&gt; recently came out. What&amp;rsquo;s included? And how much is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s $50 a year, and it includes the ability to collaborate on a site with another person, and password protection. It’s a great option for small businesses and teams, or people who want one of our t-shirts, included with every premium subscription :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt;  What will Postach.io look like in the future? Any big updates in the works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh man, I’m glad you asked. We proved the concept by launching an Evernote powered blogging platform, but the real magic isn’t specifically in using Evernote, it’s blogging using the tools you love to author content in, like Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer we’re rolling out support for something like 10 more platforms, so you can write, collect, or capture content in the platform of your choice and it will automatically be live and beautiful on your Postach.io site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt;  Last question, and be honest here. How much do you like pistachio ice cream? Best thing anyone could ever eat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I can’t speak for the rest of the team here, but I’m curiously fascinated by pistachio ice cream. It’s not love yet, but the taste is curious and I have a crush. We’ll see where it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/geekforbrains&#34;&gt;Gavin&lt;/a&gt;, my cofounder, actually thought of our name. He has a habit of waking up in the night with ideas, and this one came to him at 4am. He might be a bigger fan of pistachio ice cream than I am ;)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Celebrating 100,000 domains at iwantmyname!</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-05-13-iwantmyname-growth.png&#34; alt=&#34;iwantmyname growth&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just a few months past our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&#34;&gt;5th birthday&lt;/a&gt; now, and we&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve crossed a major milestone: 100,000 domains managed by iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s still tiny compared to the big players in the industry, but we&amp;rsquo;ve now proven our theory that there&amp;rsquo;s room on the web for a domain management service that does things a bit differently. Our mission from the start was to focus on easy-to-use, straightforward domain hosting, while getting out of our customers&amp;rsquo; way so that they can quickly set up their own web addresses. Simple and honest &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;domain pricing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/no-upselling-tactics-to-be-found-here.html&#34;&gt;no annoying upselling&lt;/a&gt; and a focus on &lt;a href=&#34;http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname&#34;&gt;great customer service&lt;/a&gt; helped us get to where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a company perspective, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to have achieved this as a bootstrapped startup from a remote corner of the world (in case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, we&amp;rsquo;re based in Wellington, New Zealand). However, we very much see ourselves as an international company, with 90% of our customers being from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the people who made all this possible: our customers. It&amp;rsquo;s inspiring to see your ideas coming to life—the countless Tumblr sites making us laugh, blogs we&amp;rsquo;re reading every day, great apps from great developers, shops selling awesome t-shirts and designers blowing the interwebs away with their artwork. You are the reason we get up every morning (and stay up late). Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A few interesting facts and tidbits from behind the scenes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The oldest domain currently under management was registered nearly 24 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve processed more than 200,000 registrations, renewals and transfers over the last 5.5 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took us a year to get to 1,000 domains under management and just a bit over 4 years for the remaining 99,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now offer &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;212 different domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; and are adding more &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&#34;&gt;on a weekly basis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your domains are being looked after by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;9 people&lt;/a&gt; (4 developers, 2 support, 1 product, 1 operations, 1 content)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 cents from each domain registered &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&#34;&gt;goes to global aid initiatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s coming next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple. We will continue with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;our mission&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that any person, organisation or company should have complete control over their web address. You should be able to own it, use it the way you want and move it if necessary. This can all be achieved by registering a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new generic top-level domains&lt;/a&gt; being released over the next few years, and we&amp;rsquo;ll do our very best to make them easier than ever to find, manage and own at iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname culture: The &#34;one salary experiment&#34;</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our blog we talk a lot about what happens in the industry we are in,
what happens on the web and around our company but not too often about
how we actually run iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that building useful products needs a functioning team, a
team that can focus on helping our customers, fixing bugs and shipping
features. We work hard to get everything sorted that could get in the
way of that for everyone in our team. Many companies talk nowadays about
optimising for happiness, Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos) often talks about
it at conferences, Github has it as one of their core principles and we
work towards achieving exactly that. But what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write a few blog posts about what we do in iwantmyname and the
experiments we run and how that pans out so far. I hope that we can be
an inspiration to others that are looking for alternative ways to
running companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the experiments that we are running in iwantmyname since we
started is the &amp;ldquo;one-salary-experiment&amp;rdquo;. At iwantmyname everyone earns
the same. This sounds strange to many and I get asked a lot of questions
how this may work once we grow bigger and the honest answer is: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t
know, but so far it works&amp;rdquo; and I give that same answer since we started
5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying idea has two main roots. First, we really think that
everyone is as important to the success of our team as anyone else in
the team. We don&amp;rsquo;t believe in hierarchy or in more important people. If
we hire you, we think you are valuable and want you to be part of our
team as a level peer, not an underling that does the stuff no one else
wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second angle we looked at is incentives around achievements.
Financial incentives work well for repetitive work but for creative work
financial incentives are counter productive. If you are interested in
backgrounds to that watch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation&#34;&gt;TED talk of Dan Pink&lt;/a&gt; about motivation as a
start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take the whole salary discussion out of the things to worry about we
just increase salaries for everyone as we grow, automagically, no action
required. It also means everyone knows what everyone else earns, full
transparency for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has a few positive side effects we initially did not think of. One
is gender equality, we have a guarantee that there is no gender gap.
Another is the stressful moment where we, the more introvert geeks, walk
up to who ever we discuss salaries with and need to re-negotiate what we
earn. It is never pleasant, for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment is working really well for us so far and I really don&amp;rsquo;t
see a reason why we can&amp;rsquo;t scale it up. It really helps us to not loose
time with something everyone needs to live but also never quite knows
how to negotiate. I think it is a very honest way of renumeration and it
is at the core of our idea around how our team works, a group of peers
working on an idea, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write a few more posts about other culture and company experiments
at iwantmyname. If there is any topic you are more interested in or
something you really want to know about us, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continue reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;part one&lt;/strong&gt; of an ongoing series about the culture of iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Using ALIAS-type DNS records for CNAME functionality on naked domains, and an easier alternative</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to set up domains using cloud hosting services like Heroku or Windows Azure, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across a limitation with their platforms in regards to using naked domains (the version without the &amp;lsquo;www&amp;rsquo; part, which is also called zone apex or root domain). There are two underlying problems here, due to the nature of how the Domain Name System works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CNAME records must not be used on naked domains, meaning they will ask you to use a sub-domain, e.g. &amp;lsquo;www&amp;rsquo; for your site or app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are unable to provide you with A records for setting up naked domains due to scalability issues. If there is an attack on their infrastructure, it would take down all sites using the same A record(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario leaves you with two different options for setting up custom domains, both of which we will explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Option 1: ALIAS-type DNS records&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Option 2: URL forwarding as alternative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Option 1: ALIAS-type DNS records&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer for why you must not use CNAME records with naked domains is simple. It&amp;rsquo;s not allowed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt&#34;&gt;because the DNS specification says so&lt;/a&gt; (and some registries are very strict about this). While you can do it theoretically, there are certain side effects—the main one being that email services on your domain &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/not-receiving-email-check-for-cname-record-on-root-domain.html&#34;&gt;will only work intermittently&lt;/a&gt;, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where DNS hosting services offering CNAME functionality on the zone apex come into play. As of writing this article, here are the companies that provide such a solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dnsmadeeasy.com&#34;&gt;DNSMadeEasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dnsimple.com&#34;&gt;DNSimple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pointdns.com&#34;&gt;PointDNS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/route53/&#34;&gt;Amazon Route 53&lt;/a&gt; (only for hosting on AWS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these services is as easy as updating your nameservers to theirs at your domain registrar. However, please note that there are no official standards around ALIAS-type DNS records yet, and there may be issues with general service availability, content delivery networks and DNSSEC. Some domain extensions like .IS don&amp;rsquo;t even allow it. Also, if you do decide to use this method for domain mapping, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/why-alias-type-records-break-the-internet.html&#34;&gt;be aware of the implications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Option 2: URL forwarding as alternative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to simply forward the naked domain &amp;lsquo;yoursitename.com&amp;rsquo; to the &amp;lsquo;www&amp;rsquo; sub-domain. Most domain registrars and DNS hosting services offer URL forwarding. If you set up Heroku or other hosted apps with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;our one-click services setup&lt;/a&gt;, we take care of this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should your registrar charge extra for URL forwarding (some do) there are services like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rootredirect.com/&#34;&gt;RootRedirect.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwizer.com&#34;&gt;wwwizer&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to achieve the same setup. The latter also offers a paid plan which gives you a dedicated IP address, and even includes an SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use forwarding, the main disadvantage is a cosmetic one—using the &amp;lsquo;www&amp;rsquo; sub-domain as your primary address. But that&amp;rsquo;s a small price to pay for a standards-compliant domain and DNS setup, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re always happy to highlight the great platforms coming out of the Wellington, NZ tech scene, but we&amp;rsquo;re especially happy to have &lt;a href=&#34;http://hoistapps.com/&#34;&gt;Hoist&lt;/a&gt; right in our backyard (and in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/hoist-custom-domain&#34;&gt;App Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for simple one-click iwantmyname installs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a bit more info about the company and what their future holds, we reached out to &lt;a href=&#34;http://hoistapps.com/blog/meet-owen-evans/&#34;&gt;Owen Evans&lt;/a&gt;, Hoist&amp;rsquo;s co-founder and CTO with a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Naming is always an interesting topic for startups. How did you come up with the name Hoist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d love to say there was an interesting and long time spent over Hoist as a name, but it came early in the piece. I&amp;rsquo;ve always believed in brand as something for people to get a sense of community about, and having a solid name was going to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in June 2013 we got together to work out what we were going to try and solve and what we wanted from a business. Part of the process was to give ourselves a name and we spent an hour throwing words related to applications, cloud, software and infrastructure on a whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then discussed a few key words that worked well as evocative imagery, but Hoist became a clear favorite and has done well to represent what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve (helping people get their applications into the cloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re based in New Zealand. Do you see this as a disadvantage as a startup and what are the main challenges?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: New Zealand is like nowhere else on earth, it&amp;rsquo;s such an amazing lifestyle that there are few times I wish I was elsewhere. We have the ability to enjoy the great outdoors, a closely connected tech and entrepreneurial scene and a great support network for aspiring entrepreneurs. I moved to Wellington from London and I often wonder if I would have been able to start a company there, just because in the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been in New Zealand I&amp;rsquo;ve met so many supportive and awesome people who made it much more possible for me personally to start out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: Unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s no getting away from the remoteness of NZ, and you really have to live here to understand truly what that means (I keep having to point out to my friends back in the UK that the closest place not in NZ is a three hour plane ride) That leads to a bunch of issues around cost of supply and such, but also leads to a lot of support for software startups as there&amp;rsquo;s a recognition that they could transform the NZ economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a very small native market; to put it in perspective there are more small businesses in California than people in NZ, that means your core market and sources of capital are likely to be offshore. that means a fair bit of travel and market research to understand the main market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between Hoist and other cloud hosting platforms like Heroku?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoist and Heroku both provide ways to host cloud apps, but where Heroku&amp;rsquo;s focus leans more to infrastructure, Hoist leans more to integrations. We&amp;rsquo;ve built the easiest way for a developer to create a &amp;ldquo;feature app&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; i.e. to extend existing cloud apps with bespoke features as well as for single page applications built entirely in Javascript/HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As SaaS becomes more and more prevalent and SMBs take on a best-of-breed approach to SaaS, there are a lot of these light-weight apps and integrations happening. Our platform is ideal for connecting to an API and adding value through a well designed user interface with a Hoist backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; We see that you&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://hoistapps.com/blog/ship-day-new-hoist-features/&#34;&gt;recently added&lt;/a&gt; buckets and connectors  to Hoist&amp;mdash;what kinds of upgrades/additions are you guys working on next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re working on making application upload better (we&amp;rsquo;re aware our current file upload solution was a bit janky; integrations such as Github and Dropbox will make that better), adding APIs for GeoOp, WorkflowMax and others as well as some work on building an API to make SaaS billing much easier for small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re also focusing on a few commercial apps going live thanks to EndGame, and as such we&amp;rsquo;ve got a few features being built out from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Having an awesome tech stack is like a badge of honor for us, and it looks like yours is quite nice, too. What are you running on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoist is primarily built on Node.js and MongoDB. We originally used CouchDB as well, but it meant one too many things for us to manage in house. Node.js was picked primarily because we saw that the language of the cloud was JSON and it made sense to transform as little as possible for understandability and speed. We love working on the stack as it&amp;rsquo;s quick, easy to use and performs really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also manage all our server configuration using Chef, which makes setting up servers a breeze and plays nicely with all the cloud infrastructure we use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>The updated big list of static website generators for your site, blog or wiki</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic websites certainly have their place on the internet, but you may find the enhanced security, performance, and ease of hosting a static site to be just what you need. So here&amp;rsquo;s a big list of static site generators to get you started, sorted by language/platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Writing a comprehensive list of static site generators would be nearly impossible (the quantity is astounding), and not all that useful, so the following list only contains generators that are actively being maintained and/or have a decent website. If you have anything to add to the list, just let us know via Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname&#34;&gt;@iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The current top 10 new domain extensions are probably not what you&#39;d expect (.GURU is still #1)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), I fully expected the domain extensions that fit sites into nice categories would be the most popular. But instead, the current top 10 is an interesting collection of professional, generic and non-Latin TLDs. We have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&#34;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF&#34;&gt;.在线&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email&#34;&gt;.EMAIL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&#34;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&#34;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&#34;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company&#34;&gt;.COMPANY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&#34;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to keep in mind though when looking at the current top 10. For one, these gTLDs are still very new, so we don&amp;rsquo;t really know what will happen once the general public catches on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the current numbers are skewed by registries parking domains themselves. From Andrew Allemann &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainnamewire.com/2014/04/16/uniregistry-activates-thousands-of-reserved-domains-per-tld/&#34;&gt;Domain Name Wire&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Uniregistry activated its reserved domain names in top level domains that have launched so far, massively increasing the size of its zones. It accounts for basically all of the growth in .sexy and .tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging by some quick checks, it appears that the majority of domains in .link, which just launched with 20,000+ domains in the zone file, are actually domains reserved by the registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take these numbers as a grain of salt, but don&amp;rsquo;t discount the general popularity of the new TLDs as a whole. There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/&#34;&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; 638,083 new gTLDs registered, and many of the most promising extensions aren&amp;rsquo;t even launched yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&#34;&gt;.KIWI&lt;/a&gt;! It&amp;rsquo;d be great to see New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s funky new domain extension sneak onto next month&amp;rsquo;s list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Peter Orum on why he chose .PICS for his photography website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, my main web project has been founding a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paintingsilove.com&#34;&gt;social networking site&lt;/a&gt; for artists to comment on each other’s paintings.  However, I have recently resumed taking black and white street photography after a long break, and I’d like to establish and promote a personal site for my photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the iwantmyname &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/which-photography-gtld-should-you-use.html&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, there are a range of different gTLDs to use for photography, including .GALLERY, .PHOTO, .PHOTOS, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .PICS &amp;amp; .PICTURES. When I found that the .PHOTOGRAPHY domain extension was available, I tried to grab street.photography, but it was already taken. So in trying to get something as close/relevant to that as possible, I was able to get streetbw.photography. As I really wanted something starting with just &amp;lsquo;street,&amp;rsquo; I also pre-ordered ‘street’ with some of the other gTLDs, just on the off-chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, after using the domain streetbw.photography for a couple of months, I found it quite cumbersome to tell someone verbally, always having to spell it out and explain it. And my wife could never remember it. So after reading the above-mentioned blog entry, it struck me that this domain just wasn’t going to work for me, and I decided to switch to something shorter with my name, such as street.peterorum.com, or even bw.peterorum.com. But luckily, the same day I found that I&amp;rsquo;d won &lt;a href=&#34;http://street.pics/&#34;&gt;street.pics&lt;/a&gt;, and I was quite excited about it because it’s short, memorable, descriptive and generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal photography sites, I think the .PICS and .PHOTOS domains are the way to go. If I had a photography business that needed branding though, I would probably choose .PHOTOGRAPHY with my name, or perhaps with my surname so my first name could be a subdomain, e.g. peter.orum.photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever of the new gTLDs you choose, make sure that the www prefix also works (using a CNAME), as many people still type that in by default, and some editors don&amp;rsquo;t automatically set the straight domain as a link yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Any non-.COM anxiety?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a non-.COM wasn’t a cause for concern for my personal site. I already have my name, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peterorum.com&#34;&gt;peterorum.com&lt;/a&gt;, and other attractive .COM domains are long gone. Discoverability these days is not so much about your domain, but rather having good content, a responsive site for mobile and good promotion. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to get a Google+ profile to link to your site so you are verified as the site author to generate trust. And, for photography, you can promote your work on other sites such as Flickr, Instragram and Twitter, with your site linked through your profile. Because of this visual exposure, an interesting, descriptive, short and memorable domain may be more important than a less memorable one that just aims to show up in Google via domain keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m happy to have street.pics as it seems to suit my purposes best from the available options. Definitely now is the time to be trying to get your first choices, even if it means buying a few and trying them out for a few months until you find the one that works best. Just don’t forget to use the appropriate redirection codes, and notify Google Webmaster Tools if changing so you don’t lose what you have built up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good.luck&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Heartbleed aftermath</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you likely know, we are now coming to understand the full implications of the OpenSSL vulnerability (aka the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://heartbleed.com/&#34;&gt;Heartbleed bug&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;) that was disclosed last week. &lt;a href=&#34;http://xkcd.com/1354/&#34;&gt;Here is an excellent graphical explanation of the vulnerability.&lt;/a&gt; New angles of attack against vulnerable infrastructure come up every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Have you patched your home router and updated your passwords after &lt;a href=&#34;http://heartbleed.com/&#34;&gt;checking sites for vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we patched all servers the day the vulnerability was disclosed. However, we also did more. Read on for more in-depth information on how we handle our security, and recommendations for our customers on managing their accounts and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iwantmyname infrastructure is split up into several layers, and the front-facing application server actually has very little data in memory. Most of our processing happens in backend servers that are not directly exposed and have had no vulnerable services running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure none of our front-facing certificates are used in unintended ways we took the time to get new EV certificates for iwantmyname and revoked the old certs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learnings from this incident include the age-old mantra of &amp;ldquo;change your passwords frequently&amp;rdquo; and consider &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification&#34;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; (2fa) where appropriate. We support 2fa at iwantmyname, together with other risk mitigation technologies to make sure your account will not get compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it comes down to your personal password &amp;ldquo;hygiene&amp;rdquo; to make sure your passwords are unique, frequently updated and securely stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using a password manager that is both secure by design and proactive about security risks. We like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.keepassx.org/&#34;&gt;KeepassX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/1password&#34;&gt;1password&lt;/a&gt;. Both are secure password storage mechanisms. If you want to roll your own password storage, make sure you use PGP/GPG to secure your passwords, and that your private keys are secured properly and long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last initiative we are currently working on is a complete disaster escalation plan. Similar to the zombie apocalypse plans some cities and organizations have prepared, this helps us to have a well-organized and communicated plan in place so everyone knows exactly what to do. This time around we were able to lock everything down very quickly, but who knows what the next bug will look like. Software is written by humans after all.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Next week is the biggest yet for new domain extensions</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally don&amp;rsquo;t like to overhype things, but the sheer volume of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out next week is a big deal. Over the course of three days (April 15-17), 14 domain extensions will be going live, and a few of them are likely to be quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the full list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 15&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-buzz&#34;&gt;.BUZZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gift&#34;&gt;.GIFT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guitars&#34;&gt;.GUITARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&#34;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&#34;&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&#34;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 16&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holiday&#34;&gt;.HOLIDAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-marketing&#34;&gt;.MARKETING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 17&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blue&#34;&gt;.BLUE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kim&#34;&gt;.KIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pink&#34;&gt;.PINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-red&#34;&gt;.RED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shiksha&#34;&gt;.SHIKSHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8&#34;&gt;.移动&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, pre-orders will be open until the launch date given, so there&amp;rsquo;s still time to get your domains on the list. Also, in case you missed it &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/new-useful-page-the-gtld-launch-calendar.html&#34;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;ve added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&#34;&gt;new page to the site&lt;/a&gt; that lists all the gTLDs with known launch dates and prices. We&amp;rsquo;ll still continue to periodically highlight these gTLDs in the blog, but if you ever need instant information, you now know where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New useful page: The gTLD launch calendar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;big list&lt;/a&gt;. And we were quite pleased with our big list, but it needed more context. So we built categories and buckets for released and about-to-be-released gTLDs—and it worked out great. But one more thing was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a way to show all the gTLD launch information we know, and we needed it to update automatically so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require insane amounts of time to manually maintain. So we built it, and we&amp;rsquo;re really happy with how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say hi to our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&#34;&gt;gTLD launch calendar&lt;/a&gt;. It has launch dates and prices for all the gTLDs we have information on, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy on the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders for all listed gTLDs are open until the launch date given, so get your domain on the list before it&amp;rsquo;s open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Find a full-bodied domain extension for your craft beverage site</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you travel in the world, there&amp;rsquo;s one cultural constant you can always count on—people take their beverages very seriously. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s coffee, beer, wine, vodka or drinks made of animal parts, there&amp;rsquo;s always something you need to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, with the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), drink makers can tap into this liquid love with domain names categorized for their craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;. COFFEE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quartz posted an eye-opening &lt;a href=&#34;http://qz.com/166983/where-the-worlds-biggest-coffee-drinkers-live/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; (excuse the pun) back in January about coffee consumption around the world—specifically about how much more coffee Northern Europe drinks than the US, UK, France, Spain and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As surprising as it was though to find that the Netherlands consumes 2.414 cups of coffee a day (compared to .939 cups in New Zealand and .931 cups in the US), the most interesting stat to me was that people in nearly every country drink coffee daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, just imagine how many coffee shops there must be. And how many coffee roasters there are delivering beans to markets and restaurants. Now take that one step further and imagine how many coffee-related sites there are on the web. The number must be insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the .COFFEE TLD has quite a bit of room to grow. Of the Donuts &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.donuts.co/tlds/&#34;&gt;mega-list of gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;, this one may be the biggest (maybe even bigger than the surprise hit, .GURU?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee&#34;&gt;.COFFEE&lt;/a&gt; is now open to the public, so hurry up an grab your domain before someone else does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.BEER and .WINE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more loved than coffee, beer and wine are arguably the most important beverages in human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/opinion/sunday/how-beer-gave-us-civilization.html&#34;&gt;From Jeffrey Kahn &amp;ndash; New York Times:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the effects of these early brews were discovered, the value of beer (as well as wine and other fermented potions) must have become immediately apparent. With the help of the new psychopharmacological brew, humans could quell the angst of defying those herd instincts. Conversations around the campfire, no doubt, took on a new dimension: the painfully shy, their angst suddenly quelled, could now speak their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the alcohol would have had more far-ranging effects, too, reducing the strong herd instincts to maintain a rigid social structure. In time, humans became more expansive in their thinking, as well as more collaborative and creative. A night of modest tippling may have ushered in these feelings of freedom — though, the morning after, instincts to conform and submit would have kicked back in to restore the social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, beer and wine serve much the same purpose, and because of their popularity, have developed online ecosystems that go far beyond the major brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microbreweries, vineyards, distributors, stores, home-brew sites, review blogs and drink-centric magazines—all competing for the same namespaces. We expect to see a number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer&#34;&gt;.BEER&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wine&#34;&gt;.WINE&lt;/a&gt; domains popping up once the TLDs go live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-orders are open now for both domain extensions, and keep checking our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates&#34;&gt;gTLD launch page&lt;/a&gt; for upcoming launch details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.VODKA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The king of the clears, vodka is the only &amp;ldquo;hard alcohol&amp;rdquo; set to launch as a gTLD. And vodka stats are about as unsurprising as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://qz.com/179708/map-where-the-worlds-biggest-vodka-drinkers-are/&#34;&gt;From Roberto A Ferdman &amp;ndash; Quartz:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one downs vodka like Russia does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians drink some 17.3 shots of vodka per month on average, according to data from Euromonitor. That’s easily the most in the world. The Polish, the second biggest vodka drinkers in Euromonitor’s sample, throw back about 13.7 shots per month; while Ukrainians drink roughly 10 shots per month. Americans come in at only 3.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As popular as vodka is, it&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see how its comparatively small ecosystem works out for the .VODKA TLD. Don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if it&amp;rsquo;s much less popular than the drink TLDs listed above, but that could play into your advantage if you have a great .VODKA domain in mind. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vodka&#34;&gt;Pre-orders&lt;/a&gt; are open now, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to pass on additional news once launch dates are set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The surrounding ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, these new gTLDs would be used as hard categories for brands to funnel themselves into, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably not a realistic dream. .COM will be a big player for the foreseeable future, country code top-level domains will always be relevant in their respective countries, and even some non-beverage gTLDs will crossover into the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you were starting a coffee blog, would you go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-com&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, .COFFEE or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog&#34;&gt;.BLOG&lt;/a&gt;? And would you choose .BEER or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-organic&#34;&gt;.ORGANIC&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming line of organic beers (yes, they do exist)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any way you look at it, these new gTLDs are giving site owners a vast selection of great domains to choose from. So love your beverage sites, and have fun finding the perfect domain for your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Interesting stats in the latest DomainWire Domain Name Stat Report</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CENTR (Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries) released their latest &lt;a href=&#34;https://centr.org/system/files/share/domainwire_stat_report_2014_1.pdf&#34;&gt;DomainWire Stat Report&lt;/a&gt; today, delivering a wide range of stats related to ccTLD growth and overall size. Some of the information didn&amp;rsquo;t come as much of a surprise, such as .CN (China) being the fastest-growing ccTLD of the quarter (with 1.3 billion people, you&amp;rsquo;re bound to have some demand), but much of it was quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all in a name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lines for countries were originally drawn, their corresponding ccTLDs were probably not considered. But how lucky was Montenegro to get stuck with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per 100 people in the country, 114 .ME domain names have been registered. That&amp;rsquo;s more than a domain for every single person in the country. But even that is dwarfed by Liechtenstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/li-liechtensteiner-domain-name-registration-for-liechtenstein&#34;&gt;.LI&lt;/a&gt; ccTLD. For every 100 people in Liechtenstein, 173 .LI domains are sold. Only 37,000 people reside in the country, but it&amp;rsquo;s an impressive stat nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Non-Latin characters are being used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent CENTR survey, in which 21 European ccTLDs said they offer IDNs showed that as at December 2013, there were total of 1.2 million domain names in Europe containing at least one non-Latin character &amp;ndash; this represents around 6% of the domains in these ccTLDs. Compared to 6 months prior, the number of IDN domains in these ccTLDs grew with 17%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once non-Latin gTLDs start gaining traction, I think site owners will be much more likely to use non-Latin characters all over the web. This 1.2 million domain name stat could be quite a bit higher this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Germany leads Europe (and most of the world)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 15.7 million &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&#34;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt; domains, Germany leads all of Europe in ccTLD registrations. The list drops off quickly after Germany though, with .UK having 10.6 million domains and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&#34;&gt;.NL&lt;/a&gt; (Netherlands) having 5.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even Germany is dwarfed by the tiny islands of Tokelau and their .TK domain. 22.2 million domains have been registered with the .TK ccTLD, but the vast majority are likely hosted through .TKs free registration service (you can also fully own the domain for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau&#34;&gt;a price&lt;/a&gt;). Don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited though—there are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dot.tk/en/doc_tcfree_v360.pdf&#34;&gt;strict rules&lt;/a&gt; in place.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>You are the web</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine you have an email account. Possibly several. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably forgotten how many social media accounts you have. Might even have a few websites. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty common. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm&#34;&gt;Over a third&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/&#34;&gt;world&amp;rsquo;s population&lt;/a&gt; is online these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you consider &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; a website? A web property? A network? Probably not. But that could change. Might be already. Our world is becoming ever more connected and networked, and the idea of people, tech, and the Internet itself all being separate entities is becoming an increasingly archaic one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data we create online isn&amp;rsquo;t just about our emailing and browsing habits anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s not even just about computers or mobile phones. Our digital systems can include our cars, our appliances, and things we wear. All of these things are becoming more connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already aggregating our data in some relatively minor ways. There are smartphone apps that enable you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/products/10-diagnostic-apps-and-devices-to-make-you-a-better-driver#slide-1&#34;&gt;interact with your car&amp;rsquo;s diagnostics&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure-nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/gps_app/&#34;&gt;tweet your Nike+ running progress&lt;/a&gt;. So it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine this trend continuing to evolve – each of us becoming a network of sorts, a nexus for all of our connected devices and data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting our accounts to a single, central hub from which we manage activities and data is convenient. We can see everything in one place. And, perhaps more importantly, larger and disparate data sets brought together can be more useful when analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one person&amp;rsquo;s monitoring doesn&amp;rsquo;t constitute &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data&#34;&gt;Big Data&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; but, for example, if you&amp;rsquo;re a runner, looking at the metrics from all of your runs over several months will tell you a lot more about your progress than looking at the metrics for a couple of days. Now imagine combining your exercise data with the information about your diet over that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add in information about your health, mental state, stress levels, sleep patterns – the result is a pretty comprehensive view of how you&amp;rsquo;re doing. And the person is just one facet. Imagine the same type of scenario for your home. Information on utilities usage, and the ability to control things like the thermostat remotely (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nest.com/&#34;&gt;which you can already do&lt;/a&gt;). Security systems, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nest.com/smoke-co-alarm/life-with-nest-protect/&#34;&gt;smoke alarms&lt;/a&gt; that automatically alert emergency services (again, these already exist). Even things like detecting water seepage around your house foundation or roof, a carbon monoxide leak, or a problem with your furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/540977/internet_things_internet_jawbone_/&#34;&gt;Wearables can communicate with your environment, too.&lt;/a&gt; The opportunities to correct problems before they get bigger, or just see opportunities to do things more efficiently over time, are considerable. Your entire family could be part of that data hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, will we display, manage, and analyze all of this information? Where will we keep it? An app? That doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a sense of &amp;lsquo;address&amp;rsquo;, really. The standard website doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to quite fit the bill, either. As much as we&amp;rsquo;re used to the ubiquitous &amp;lsquo;.com&amp;rsquo;, given that that actually refers to &amp;lsquo;commerce&amp;rsquo;, it makes much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this is an area of great opportunity for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;the new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;. They describe vastly more things, places, and activities than &amp;lsquo;.com&amp;rsquo; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&#34;&gt;other traditional gTLDs&lt;/a&gt;, and stretch our concepts of online &amp;lsquo;addresses&amp;rsquo; or what a web &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt; is. (Especially given how much of our data is stored in the cloud.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have very specific mental models of what .com / .net / .org mean. But much less so with .systems / .home / .works and the like. Not to mention that beyond the English language, there are plenty of culturally relevant terms and concepts that could be explored, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/uno-looks-to-unite-the-spanish-speaking-web-an-interview-with-desiree-boxberger.html&#34;&gt;.UNO for Spanish speakers&lt;/a&gt;. What could be a more centralized &amp;lsquo;address&amp;rsquo; for all your information than what translates as &amp;lsquo;.one&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping categories of my information tidy and centralized under my.home or my.car could be very handy. Or, if I wanted everything in one place, my.life. A lot of sci-fi and speculative fiction already places us in worlds where that sort of all-access data all the time culture is common place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other app or social network&amp;rsquo;s settings, how much of that data we would choose to share or make public would be up to each person to decide. And while it could be invaluable to our doctors, mechanics, or contractors, it will also require a robust understanding and application of security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what we think of as &amp;lsquo;online&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;lsquo;website&amp;rsquo;, or even &amp;lsquo;content&amp;rsquo;, is evolving. It will no longer just be a partial repository for some of our stuff, or a way to share cat pictures. As sensors become more accurate, devices more wearable, and reliable high-speed connections more ubiquitous, these things may become, to a considerable degree, a reflection of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who will you choose to be on that &amp;lsquo;net?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>There is internet history being made in Singapore</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://singapore49.icann.org/en/&#34;&gt;49th ICANN meeting&lt;/a&gt; officially started today and the community is back in Singapore where internet history was made when new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were approved in 2011. Coincidentally, Singapore was also the location of the first ever ICANN conference in 1999 so there couldn&amp;rsquo;t be a better place to get together again now that &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new gTLDs are a reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always inspiring to see internet veterans like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker&#34;&gt;Steve Crocker&lt;/a&gt; talking about the early days when he was helping to define protocols for the ARPANET which developed into today&amp;rsquo;s internet as we know it. Or hearing about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Postel&#34;&gt;Jon Postel&lt;/a&gt; managing the whole DNS on a little index card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more history being discussed and that is &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/16177-who-runs-the-internet-an-icann-49-primer&#34;&gt;who will run the internet&lt;/a&gt;. It was recently announced that the last legal vestige of US control will dissapear in 2015. This transition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://iana.org&#34;&gt;IANA&lt;/a&gt; (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) from American stewardship to the international community starts today. IANA is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources. The proposed international stewardship could be a multi-stakeholder solution with ICANN, W3C, regional internet registries like RIPE or ARIN, root operators, IETF, ccTLDs and others. This week&amp;rsquo;s discussions will be an important first step towards a truly global and open internet which should not be run by just one country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What else is happening?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New gTLDs are still a big topic—especially their &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.icann.org/2014/03/the-tld-universal-acceptance-project/&#34;&gt;universal acceptance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on practical operational experience, not all systems (e.g. browsers, spam filters, registration databases, user profiles, ISPs, etc.) work seamlessly when new TLDs are added. Users may experience failures in resolution or other issues with newer TLDs, which in turn impacts consumer trust on the DNS. The issue of the Universal Acceptance of TLDs (Top-Level Domains) is critically related to the introduction of new gTLDs, as well as the introduction of IDN ccTLDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we pointed out in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/an-open-letter-to-web-platforms-about-gtld-adoption.html&#34;&gt;open letter to web platforms&lt;/a&gt;, there is still a lot of work to do. Companies like Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/twitter-is-now-supporting-most-of-the-gtlds.html&#34;&gt;have been catching up&lt;/a&gt; but browser support can still be patchy. We are looking forward to attendees from Mozilla, Google and Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;http://singapore49.icann.org/en/schedule/mon-tld-acceptance&#34;&gt;giving us an update on that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you at ICANN Singapore and would like to meet? &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>250,000 new gTLDs have been registered, and .GURU is still at the top</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, as of writing this post, the internet is sitting with 294,066 new gTLDs. And considering the first TLDs only started being offered for general availability in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html&#34;&gt;early February&lt;/a&gt;, the public reception has been quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not the steady growth that shocks me the most—it&amp;rsquo;s the top of the list of TLDs that are doing best. Here&amp;rsquo;s the current top 10 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ntldstats.com/&#34;&gt;from ntldstats.com&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&#34;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many great gTLDs out now (and so many more coming), it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe the sustained popularity of .GURU. Today, it makes up nearly 17% of all the new gTLDs on the web, and seems to be growing at a steady pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like though that something will eventually overtake .GURU on the gTLD list. The question is, what will it be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips&#34;&gt;.TIPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today&#34;&gt;.TODAY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology&#34;&gt;.TECHNOLOGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin&#34;&gt;.BERLIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location-based gTLDs are going to be a big deal. .BERLIN, .NYC, .LONDON—expect to see a few of these extensions on or near the top 10 once they are public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory&#34;&gt;.DIRECTORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing&#34;&gt;.CLOTHING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&#34;&gt;.BIKE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land&#34;&gt;.LAND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>The web at 25: Our favorite websites</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-03-13-macbook-internet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;internet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is 25 today. A big birthday indeed—but what do you get a good friend who has everything? Cake? A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mistobox.com/&#34;&gt;Mistobox&lt;/a&gt; coffee membership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of thought, we decided to pool together all of our favorite websites to create a &amp;ldquo;best of&amp;rdquo; list. Some sites are new, some are considered old, but all have played a part in making the internet what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ingersoll &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kingersoll&#34;&gt;@kingersoll&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com/&#34;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gmail.com/&#34;&gt;gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/&#34;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hckrnews.com/&#34;&gt;hckrnews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com/&#34;&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special mention to Chrome, which has been an huge help in pushing the web forward. From the omnibox, to speedy JS via the V8 engine, to regular releases with automatic updates (see graph of Chrome usage per version), to adoption of current and upcoming web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Spence &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GeniusNet&#34;&gt;@geniusnet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m not working on iwantmyname stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s really more about consuming content, or even better, not spending time in front of a screen at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melanie Baker &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/melle&#34;&gt;@melle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to pick sites from my entire time online. So some these are old and not used much these days, but I remember spending a lot of time on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>An interview with Frank Schilling about Uniregistry, .SEXY, .TATTOO and not joining the registry dark side</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p75KeJN9D0E&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are domain registries, and there are domain registries with ambitious founders located in the Cayman Islands. Much to the enjoyment of the likely tan staff at &lt;a href=&#34;http://uniregistry.com/&#34;&gt;Uniregistry&lt;/a&gt;, they are in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched to the public in 2014, Uniregistry has seven domain extensions coming out this year, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link&#34;&gt;.LINK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gift&#34;&gt;.GIFT&lt;/a&gt; (offered by Dot Gift, LLC), &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guitars&#34;&gt;.GUITARS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics&#34;&gt;.PICS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo&#34;&gt;.PHOTO&lt;/a&gt;, and two that were just released yesterday—&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sexy&#34;&gt;.SEXY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo&#34;&gt;.TATTOO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the fairly conservative gTLDs that have been released thus far, .SEXY and .TATTOO represent edgy fun, giving an alternative crowd some gTLD to latch onto. So we decided to ask Frank Schilling, Founder and Managing Director of Uniregistry, a few questions about how it&amp;rsquo;s all going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were a fortune teller and I came to you asking about .TATTOO and .SEXY, what would you tell me? Long, happy life? Fast growth? What does the future hold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOL. I honestly think .TATTOO and .SEXY will be a lot like me. Slow start. Late bloomer. Big success in later years. These strings are low priced, have high registrar margins and tons of natural affinity. I think they are long-term niches that won’t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.TATTOO already has a built-in marketplace, but .SEXY seems to be open to interpretation. What kinds of sites do you see popping up with .SEXY domains?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very good question. I think it’s the ultimate discrete adult fashion [domain]. People will find ways to interpret where that takes them. If I were a model or a dancer or an entertainer, .SEXY is delightfully benign and leaves just enough to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of the .TATTOO marketplace, it&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to hear about people&amp;rsquo;s apprehension to stray from .COM. Do you foresee any issues with getting tattoo shops to make the leap?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No—none at all. There is safety in numbers and with so many new extensions coming we’re in good shape from an acceptability standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a marketing prospective, how are you getting .SEXY and .TATTOO in front of your future customers? It seems that tech-centric gTLDs are doing alright because their audience is up on the gTLD namespace expansion, but what about the non-tech crowd?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to rely on our registrar partners to suggest our names as viable alternatives—and we have our own registrar and direct marketing for that beginning March 8th. I definitely view this as a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-02-27-uniregistry-careers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about Uniregistry itself. Many people probably think you all just sit on gorgeous Cayman Island beaches all day, but your job page has openings for software developers, systems specialists and marketing people. What&amp;rsquo;s day to day life like at Uniregistry? And what kinds of things are you working on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a beach here??!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing we’ve been working on is our registrar and registries.  It has been a ton of work and will be a mature product this year. We’re developing interesting ways to deliver domains to consumers&amp;hellip;its work. But we feel confident we’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And one last question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have some very user-friendly policies like no restore fees, a long restore period and no priority access phases. We dig this a lot at iwantmyname! What made you decide to not join the dark side of the registry force?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember what it was like to be a registrant. We want our spaces to be easy to use, easy to develop and easy to trade with hands-off governance of registrants. We want our registrants to thrive here. There will be bumps along the way as we’re new at this, but I’m confident we’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Not receiving email at your domain? Check for a CNAME record on the root level.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We used to hear this all too frequently in our support channels. A customer adds a new DNS record for their website and suddenly can&amp;rsquo;t receive email on their domain—the email service that had been working fine in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause? That CNAME record that was just added to the naked/root domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://joshstrange.com/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-put-a-cname-record-on-your-root-domain/&#34;&gt;Josh Strange recently published an article&lt;/a&gt; relaying this exact situation where a seemingly convenient CNAME record on his root domain prevented his email service from working without him realizing it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just this last weekend I went to signup for an eBay Developers account so I could play with the API but the email confirmation never came through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- this is just to break up the block quotes --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something clicked in my head and I started to vaguely remember reading something when first setting up my blog about how CNAME records don&amp;rsquo;t belong on your root domain. When I had read that I had written it off as I did not fully understand what it was saying at the time. Now, armed with this revelation, I started searching for &amp;ldquo;CNAME and MX conflicts&amp;rdquo; and found countless people warning against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of digging, he found &lt;a href=&#34;http://serverfault.com/a/91718/14374&#34;&gt;the answer on ServerFault&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common error. You cannot use a CNAME RR for your root domain (e.g. company.com) &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; define additional resource records for the same zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.dnsmadeeasy.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/14/0/why-cant-i-create-a-cname-record-for-the-root-record&#34;&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I create a CNAME record for the root record?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1034.html&#34;&gt;RFC1034&lt;/a&gt; section 3.6.2 for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we understand that DNS can be tricky and we don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to know all the ins-and-outs. For your sanity, our DNS manager prevents you from adding a CNAME record to your root domain. And all of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;one-click DNS configurations&lt;/a&gt; ensure that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can, of course, still add this record for you, but only after you confirm that you understand the risks of breaking the RFC. For web apps that require a CNAME record (e.g. Heroku, Ghost), we redirect your naked domain to the &amp;ldquo;www&amp;rdquo; variant so that the CNAME can be used correctly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An introduction to Ghost with John O&#39;Nolan</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-02-20-ghost.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ghost&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of platforms your could use to get a blog up and running, but one of the newest entries into the field is perhaps the most exciting—a platform called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. And what makes it exciting is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to do everything for everyone. There are no e-commerce features, no integrated social networks and no ambitions to create fully blown-out sites—it&amp;rsquo;s just a platform for (beautifully) publishing content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Ghost site states, &amp;ldquo;Ghost is an Open Source application which allows you to write and publish your own blog, giving you the tools to make it easy and even fun to do. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time making your blog work and more time blogging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to help you decide if Ghost is the right platform for your blog, I asked &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JohnONolan&#34;&gt;John O&amp;rsquo;Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, the guy who &lt;a href=&#34;http://john.onolan.org/project-ghost/&#34;&gt;originally dreamed up the platform&lt;/a&gt;, many of the questions people have asked me. And because he&amp;rsquo;s such a great guy (I&amp;rsquo;m serious, he&amp;rsquo;s a really great guy), he was happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Say you&amp;rsquo;re brand new to blogging. Starting from scratch. What differentiates a platform like Ghost from Wordpress, Squarespace, Tumblr and the rest of the platforms out there? What does the prototypical Ghost user look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is an excellent question! Each of these platforms are actually pretty incredible pieces of software. The important thing is that they all do slightly different things, and are built in slightly different ways, so it really comes down to choosing what’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want a simple website with e-commerce that you use to run your business website? Give Squarespace a try. If you want to participate in a social network with sharing and re-posting and lots of cats, maybe Tumblr would be a better fit for you. On the other hand, if you’re looking to develop your own fully-fledged website or application with every imaginable bell and whistle, WordPress might be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a simple but powerful independent publication. Something which is focused on the writing experience and giving you the freedom to be in complete control of your content. Well, then you might find Ghost interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Ok, so Ghost sounds like what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain&#34;&gt;With my domain name in hand&lt;/a&gt;, how much work am I going to have to do to get my blog up and running? Do I need anything extra like hosting space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be! So there are two ways to set up a blog with Ghost and that shiny new domain name you’re holding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; and start using our hosted platform. The hosted platform is a service which allows you to start a new Ghost blog in a couple of clicks, and has premium plans starting at just $5 per month. The other great thing about our hosted platform is that all the money we make from it actually goes towards funding developers to work on the Ghost software and make it better. We’re a very proud non-profit, so this helps the entire project in a big way &amp;ndash; and yes! You can use your domain name here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Ghost is Open Source, you can actually download it and run the software on (almost) any computer in the world. It’ll work on your laptop, your web server, or even your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;. So if you’re a developer and you’d like to roll-your-own installation of Ghost. You can certainly do that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: The biggest fear I have is that my blog will feel super generic. What can I do to really personalize my blog&amp;rsquo;s appearance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a wise fear to have. It’s always important to make your blog unique and memorable, branding is a big deal! Fortunately, there are hundreds (soon: thousands) of beautiful Ghost themes which you can install to add a beautiful design to your blog and really make it stand out. &lt;a href=&#34;http://marketplace.ghost.org&#34;&gt;The best place to start is by having a look on our marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll find a very large collection of different styles and options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I&amp;rsquo;ve read that on Wordpress I can get plugins like Yoast to boost my SEO—and ranking high in Google is super important to me. Is there something like that on Ghost? Should I even be worried about SEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search Engine Optimisation is something which is absolutely pivotal to the success of a blog. We’ve done a huge amount of work inside Ghost to make sure that search engines can find your blog easily from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is built-in so that you don’t have to rely on third party extensions to get a great SEO experience. It’s also worth noting that one of the biggest ranking factors that search engines look at these days is page-load speed. Because of the technology which Ghost is built on, it loads fast. Really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What does the future hold for Ghost? In 2020, will my blog seem as dated as my friend&amp;rsquo;s Xanga site does today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to tell you &amp;ndash; you should immediately cut ties with this friend. Being associated with Xanga lover is just not something you want to come out in public. It’s time for an intervention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost has very big ambitions. The future for Ghost is very much aimed towards creating a platform to power large online publications. Unlike some of the more trendy social networks which depend on buzz to survive &amp;ndash; Ghost is really just a tool to get things done, so it will always be useful. We’ll be adding much more functionality around the publishing and collaborative writing experience as we grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is there anything else I should know before getting started? Anything I haven’t thought of yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you’ve asked some really great questions, and I feel like that shouldn’t be ignored &amp;ndash; so here’s a discount coupon which will give you 2 months free on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghost.org/&#34;&gt;Ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; hosted platform, if you’d like to give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code: &lt;code&gt;IWMN2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An interview with Jordan Schau of Pure Fix Cycles about .BIKE, new gTLDs and fixies</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-02-14-purefix.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;purefixcycles.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 5th marked an important day in domain name history. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html&#34;&gt;Seven new gTLDs were released to the public&lt;/a&gt;, including .CLOTHING, .GURU, .HOLDINGS, .SINGLES, .PLUMBING, .VENTURES and .BIKE. As a domain registrar, we have unique insight into gTLD popularity—we have data!—but at the end of the day, we really have no idea how these domains will be used. Will companies completely switch over from .COM? Are these domains being used for fun side projects? We have no idea—so we decided to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, we have Jordan Schau of &lt;a href=&#34;http://purefixcycles.com/&#34;&gt;Pure Fix Cycles&lt;/a&gt;, who is the proud owner of quite a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike&#34;&gt;.BIKE domains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Jordan, thanks for doing this with us! So first, tell me a bit about yourself, your company and why fixies are so awesome (people should know!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; Hmm about me, thats a tough one! I’m a tech nerd with a passion for bikes.  I started Pure Fix Cycles with my brother and two best friends right out of college, and the idea was to be a direct-to-consumer offering for stylish and affordable bikes. So thats what we did. Now, we’re in over 500 stores and shipping bikes across the globe &amp;ndash; spreading the fixed gear love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are fixies awesome? Have you seen one!? They’re just those bikes you see that look incredibly cool and require almost no maintenance. They’re also really fun to ride. Sold yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; As you know, .BIKE was released to the public on February 5th—and you&amp;rsquo;re now the proud owner of quite a few .BIKE domains. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind me asking, what are some of your plans for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, to be entirely honest, I’m not so sure! Some domains will probably just point to purefixcycles.com like fixedgear.bike and others we’ll do something a bit more fun. One little fun one is &lt;a href=&#34;http://nicks.bike&#34;&gt;nicks.bike&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; thats Nick’s bike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s the big question. As a small business owner, do you think you&amp;rsquo;ll ever move your company from a .com domain to a .bike domain—or any other generic domain extension for that matter? Is the world ready for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; I doubt we’ll ever switch our dot com domains to dot bike domains entirely, but thats not to say they both can&amp;rsquo;t coexist. The simplest way might be having things forward to other domains like we’re doing with fixedgear.bike. If we were to launch something totally new, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t count out using a fresh new .bike domain. But, I don’t think the mainstream is quite ready to trust .bike domains yet. An example: I told my partner that we got fixedgear.bike and he said “So if we go to fixedgear.bike dot com, that will be us?” People are just so used to .coms that it will be tough to jump ship to .bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; There are so many small-business owners looking to create their own sites, but don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to start. But your site really is beautiful. Big images, custom logos, nice typography—how did you build it? And what sort of platform/hosting are you using?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; We use (and love) &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&#34;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; to host Pure Fix. They’ve been a really great partner for us to work with. We also have an awesome team that helps with everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So give me the rundown. The city I&amp;rsquo;m in is flat with good bike lanes and a few great coffee shops and bars to ride to and from. But nothing is super close, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to go as fast as possible. What&amp;rsquo;s the bike for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jordan:&lt;/strong&gt; The bike for you? I’d say one of our original fixies!

				<title>An open letter to web platforms about gTLD adoption</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Web Platforms,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love you—I love you—but you&amp;rsquo;re making us sad. See, we&amp;rsquo;re currently undergoing the biggest change in domain name history, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;more than 500 gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; coming out in the near future. But without your help, adoption rates will suffer. And if adoption rates suffer, the vast expansion of the internet namespace is all for naught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started just this week. A support ticket came in saying a customer couldn&amp;rsquo;t get their new gTLD to work in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url&#34;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;. Then another in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software&#34;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;. Then another in Google Apps—built by a company that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seroundtable.com/google-gtlds-15301.html&#34;&gt;bidding to own quite a few gTLDs themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, we thought it might be us. Maybe we did something to anger the TLD gods? Fortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem on our end—the new gTLDs just weren&amp;rsquo;t registering as actual domain names in various platform dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a hard update to make, but keeping up with the pace of the launches is proving to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, we get it. Running our domain registrar is hard work, and I can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine loading up with rapid-fire updates out of left field. So for web platforms and hosted services offering custom domains, I can certainly see how something like this could go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s what I can do to help. If you work for a web platform and email me directly at chris at iwantmyname dot com, I&amp;rsquo;ll personally send you a list of the new TLDs being released to the general public the following week. That&amp;rsquo;ll give you time to add them into your system—and will hopefully prevent some support tickets coming your way in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, here are some additional resources (the ones we use) for finding out which TLDs exist or are in the pipeline currently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db&#34;&gt;IANA Root Zone Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings&#34;&gt;ICANN Delegated Strings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://publicsuffix.org/list/effective_tld_names.dat&#34;&gt;Mozilla Public Suffix List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps&amp;hellip; and thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Jo-John Torres, Business Development Manager of DotClub</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-01-24-logo-no-url-500px.png&#34; alt=&#34;logo-no-url-500px.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: Hi Jo-John, thanks for chatting with us! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the big topic&amp;mdash;tell us all about .club. Who do you see as the primary market for it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; We see &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&#34;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; as a mainstream, mass-market TLD, and it has already consistently been listed in the &amp;ldquo;Top 10&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;most popular&amp;rdquo; of the new TLDs by websites offering pre-registration interest and watch lists. Of all the top names, .CLUB will be the first of the most popular names to launch early in 2014. All the other top names (excluding GEOs) are still in contention or have GAC advice which may delay their launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the market for .CLUB as very broad, including clubs and membership organizations, retailers for their loyalty and affinity programs, sports teams, fan clubs, night clubs, golf, tennis and country clubs, all of the millions of social groups on Facebook, Yahoo, Google and LinkedIn, as well as anyone with a passion for something. Because of this very broad appeal, .CLUB is typically featured in several categories, such as Business, Sports, Entertainment, Social, Travel, and Generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the word &amp;ldquo;CLUB&amp;rdquo; hits the mainstream market throughout the whole world.  The word CLUB is spelled the same and means the same all over the world. The meaning of the word is bringing people together who share a common bond of interest and passion, which is about building communities. It&amp;rsquo;s your passion, your .CLUB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: We&amp;rsquo;re hearing a lot of talk about the launch of the new gTLDs (like .club, .blog and .app) being the start of a post-.com era. Do you think the average &amp;ldquo;web surfer&amp;rdquo; is ready for that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; We truly feel the &amp;ldquo;web surfers&amp;rdquo; of today&amp;rsquo;s generation are ready. Because many of the new TLDs, like .CLUB, actually are words that add meaning to whatever you put to the left of the dot, they can offer better branding identity and representation making it a better way to target their audience. Not only is it very hard to get a good .com name anymore, but what does &amp;ldquo;.com&amp;rdquo; actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new gTLDs will offer businesses and consumers a great deal of choice when it comes to finding the perfect domain name. Choice is always a good thing. .CLUB, for example, is an open, universal and global gTLD with no restrictions or special requirements for getting a name. That means that .CLUB will draw all sorts of people who belong to a large or small group or organization sharing the same bond of a common goal, interest, or passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: We love a good domain name here at iwantmyname, and .club has a number of great domain possibilities available (chess.club was a huge hit in my younger years). Give us a few good ones people should be pining for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; There are so many great names where the word to the right of the dot actually adds meaning and value.  Retailers can use a .CLUB name for their loyalty programs, such as Safeway.club or Admirals.club. Then, there are the social groups like the one you mentioned you were part of, Chess.club. How about people who are Poker Hobbyists like Poker.club or owners of Jeeps who have a passion to go off-road and have a club called Jeepsters.club, and of course for all of these club categories there are countless regional versions &amp;ndash; BocaRatonChess.club, VegasPoker.club, MiamiTennis.club, and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: What does the future of .club look like? How big do you expect it to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; We expect the future of .CLUB to be very bright as there are millions of existing clubs who could use the name as well as all the other market segments we mentioned earlier. We have a high-level goal to reach 5 Million Domain Names in 5 years, and while aggressive, we feel it is attainable. We&amp;rsquo;re positioning .CLUB as a mainstream global brand, and we are backing that up with world-class partners and an extensive marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn: Last but not least, given that you&amp;rsquo;re the experts on .club, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you know your way around a bottle of club soda. Have any good club soda tips for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo-John:&lt;/strong&gt; You mean .CLUB Soda, our official beverage!  &amp;hellip; Just add some ice &amp;amp; gin or vodka and it is the perfect drink to when you visit a night.club! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow .CLUB on Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/getDotClub&#34;&gt;@getDotClub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The internet is (finally) for everyone</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-01-17-ODNG.png&#34; alt=&#34;ODNG.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a native-English speaker, the internet is as easily navigable for me as going to the supermarket. Just go to my English-language browser and type in a domain with a native-character extension like .COM or .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the planet is large, and most of us weren&amp;rsquo;t born into English-speaking households. The alphabet I look at every day doesn&amp;rsquo;t even use the same characters as Cyrillic or Arabic. So how could a native Japanese speaker feel welcome on the web when domain extensions are limited to Latin characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, with the rollout of the new generic Top-Level Domains, it&amp;rsquo;s all changing. A number of new TLDs are set to be available soon, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%A9&#34;&gt;.شبكة&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91&#34;&gt;.中文网&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD&#34;&gt;.Онлайн&lt;/a&gt;. And just this week, &lt;a href=&#34;http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.sg/2014/01/is-now-available-for-everyone.html?m=1&#34;&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-みんな&#34;&gt;.みんな&lt;/a&gt;, the first TLD in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana&#34;&gt;hiragana&lt;/a&gt;, will be open for general availability on February 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FmLnNDw23Y&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video from Google really sums up the sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl in video: (Referring to the new native domains) Wow! They all seem so nice and easy to understand! Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided! I&amp;rsquo;m moving here too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t everyone? It&amp;rsquo;s such a practical idea for the TLDs to be native to everyone, and now it&amp;rsquo;s finally starting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why ALIAS-type DNS Records Break The Internet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blog/1715-faster-more-awesome-github-pages&#34;&gt;GitHub announced faster, more awesome GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; recommending a new DNS setup for custom domains. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the implications if you consider setting up your naked domain with a so-called ALIAS record—more about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know DNS is, by definition, a heavily cached protocol. This means that if you change a DNS record, it will take some time until everyone who knows about the record actually sees the changes. Why did the DNS industry think this was a good idea? Because DNS is an old protocol and old servers used to have downtime and connectivity issues. If your nameserver is unreachable, the DNS caching built into the specification makes sure your domain still resolves if it has been cached in a resolver along your resolution path. That is a lot of stuff to digest, so here is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-01-08-cache-name-res.png&#34; alt=&#34;cache-name-res.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time a DNS record is looked up at the authoritative DNS, the record gets cached in your ISPs resolver cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2014-01-08-auth-name-res.png&#34; alt=&#34;auth-name-res.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent lookups for the same record will only hit the resolver cache even if the authoritative cache is offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behaviour is important for the resilience of the DNS, and makes sure that even if things go wrong we can try to recover. The two important concepts introduced above are caching resolver versus authoritative nameserver. An authoritative nameserver always is the final authority on a DNS record and can deliver records in a predictable speed to make sure your DNS records are delivered in a fast and consistent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter the ALIAS-type record&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to point an apex or root domain to a different DNS record, as you would do to map it onto an existing service like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, some providers offer something called an ALIAS record. These ALIAS-type records blur the lines between a caching resolver and an authoritative nameserver. An ALIAS record resolves on request the IP address of the destination record and serves it as if it would be the IP address for the apex domain requested. If the IP address for the destination changes, the IP address for the mapped domain changes automatically as well. This is really handy for service providers but makes every DNS provider concerned about service stability run in horror. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS records get cached, as we have seen above. So if your DNS record is cached for IP address 1.2.3.4 and the service provider changes the record to 5.6.7.8, you will send traffic for your mapped apex domain to the wrong address until the record expires in all caching resolvers. This depends on how well your ISP sticks to the protocol and can take up to a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also potentially break geoIP optimisations because suddenly you request the IP address from the nameserver of your DNS provider, not from your actual location. This may even get you in trouble with location restricted services (think Unblock-Us, just not in an intended way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There is no official industry standard yet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNAME-like functionality on the zone apex has no formal specification and a very small backing in the industry that can only be called experimental at this stage. While we fully support experimental new approaches for many things, DNS and our customers connectivity for their domains is not one of them. We believe that DNS needs to be rock solid and reliable no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right way of doing it is to accept that a root domain mapped onto another service either needs an IP address to point to or an HTTP redirect to a &amp;lsquo;www&amp;rsquo; subdomain that can be pointed to your destination via CNAME. As long as there is no official DNS industry standard, embrace your &amp;lsquo;www&amp;rsquo; subdomain and do not use aforementioned ALIAS-type records. It breaks the internet!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2013 A Year Of Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-12-23-pohu.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pohu.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did 2013 go? The year in which we celebrated our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/happy-5th-birthday-iwantmyname.html&#34;&gt;5th birthday&lt;/a&gt; seems to have flown by at break-neck speed. Perhaps this is partly because we were gripped by astonishing world events both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand we were shocked by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-disaster-help-if-you-can.html&#34;&gt;cyclone disaster&lt;/a&gt; that overtook the Philippines and galvanised nations into action throughout the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, we were excited by the bloom of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/the-next-batch-of-gtlds-are-here-including-careers-photos-and-shoes.html&#34;&gt;new top level domains&lt;/a&gt; (gTLDs) that have finally been approved by internet governing body ICANN and for which we have begun to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a year in which we increased our engagement in the local community through initiatives such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/2013/12/18/the-twelve-gifts-of-christmas-startup-weekend-edition/&#34;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/rails-girls-rally.html&#34;&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/kiwi-code-retreat----advancing-the-art-of-coding-software.html&#34;&gt;Kiwi Code Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. That involvement looks set to continue early in 2014 with &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&#34;&gt;Wellington Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://drupalsouth2014.drupal.org.nz/&#34;&gt;Drupal South&lt;/a&gt; headlining in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in the Philippines led to us to bringing forward our long held plans to contribute a portion of our sales revenue to social causes. What more deserving beneficiary could there be in 2013? We &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html&#34;&gt;selected&lt;/a&gt; Save The Children&amp;rsquo;s Philippines fund to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global economy also showed some signs of improvement this year and we responded by adding our first U.S. based employee &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/chris-hall-is-a-writer.html&#34;&gt;Chris Hall&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s being doing an outstanding job delivering high value web content that gets us noticed in the world. If you want to keep up with the latest in tech tips and updates on the domain name business, be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&#34;&gt;international blog&lt;/a&gt; channel. It seems our promotional efforts and rising international reputation did not go unnoticed &amp;ndash; in 2013 we even got a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/technology/personaltech/planting-your-flag-on-a-patch-of-the-web.html&#34;&gt;nice mention in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the home front, the New Zealand registry began marketing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz&#34;&gt;new .nz domain&lt;/a&gt; after a hurry up from &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/kiwi-domain-ready-to-fly.html&#34;&gt;.kiwi&lt;/a&gt; which got the nod from ICANN earlier in the year. We are expecting 2014 to be just as busy with more gTLDs in the pipeline plus more development to make iwantmyname even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best wishes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&#34;&gt;the iwantmyname crew&lt;/a&gt;, thanks for supporting us this year and have a safe and happy Christmas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Interview About .NZ With Patrick Watson, DNCL Communications Advisor</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-12-13-DNClogo.gif&#34; alt=&#34;DNClogo.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a New Zealand-based domain registrar, it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that we have a soft spot for our domestic domains. And with .NZ coming out soon, we reached out to Patrick Watson of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dnc.org.nz&#34;&gt;Domain Name Commission Ltd (DNCL)&lt;/a&gt; to get all the details about the upcoming launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally competition is seen as a good thing, but how do you expect the New Zealand domain market to change once .NZ and .KIWI are both live? Which will capture the local imagination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition has always existed in the .nz domain name space and so .kiwi&amp;rsquo;s entrance into the market isn&amp;rsquo;t anything new. In fact, we welcome the competition. Looking into the future, no one can really predict how the public will see .kiwi in relation to .nz or what will happen in New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s domain name market.  This is particularly true against the backdrop of all the other gTLDs that will be rolled out over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we believe people get domain names that seem most relevant to them and speak to their unique identity or purpose. How they come to this decision is entirely their own, but the Domain Name Commission urges people to make informed decisions, do their own research, and
see what makes sense to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all this, last year a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getyourselfonline.co.nz/sites/default/files/nzrs_report_FINAL_v2_0_0.pdf&#34;&gt;Colmar Brunton survey&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,001 people and 517 business people. This was before the .kiwi launch. From this research it was found that New Zealand consumers much preferred .nz websites to .com ones and that both New Zealand businesses and consumers perceived .nz as local, friendly, trusted and
familiar. We also found consumers preferred to use .nz websites over .com ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of all these factors we are sure .nz domain names will stay appealing and relevant, even with .kiwi in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the growth expectations for .NZ? And how long to you think it&amp;rsquo;ll take it to take over .CO.NZ in the everyday lexicon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; It is difficult to predict how consumers will respond to registrations directly at the second level, how they&amp;rsquo;ll casually speak about it, or how the marketplace will react. If you studied how all .nz second levels performed when first introduced, you&amp;rsquo;d find all types of trends. Similarly .nz registrations directly at the second level will follow their own natural course as dictated by market forces and consumer behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of overall .nz growth, which includes all second levels, the .nz domain name space has doubled in size over the last six years. And, in the 2012-2013 financial year, the .nz space experienced a 10.16% growth from the year before.  At the very minimum, DNCL expects these growth trends to remain.  Given the significance of allowing registrations directly at the second level, though, our gut feeling is that .nz growth will increase more than typical in the short term following this decision. As we also believe there is still an important place for second levels within the .nz domain name space, we simultaneously think that they too will grow with time. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dnc.org.nz/content/fy_stats.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to all of the DNCL&amp;rsquo;s statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So what happens to existing .CO.NZ domains now? Will there be a grandfathering period? Priority registration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that no change will be made to existing second levels &amp;ndash; all existing domain names will continue to be available, and people will still be able to register new domain names in second level categories like .co.nz, .org.nz, etc. DNCL will also continue to expand the choice of second levels as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2014, a final policy implementing the proposal will be subject to public consultation and it will explain in detail what will happen to existing .nz registrants. What is unlikely to change is what is explained in our existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://dnc.org.nz/faq-registrations-directly-second-level?m=635&#34;&gt;FAQ section&lt;/a&gt;, which states that anyone who held a .nz domain name prior to 9am on 30 May 2012 will have access, or be eligible to, some sort of preferential registration. They will fit into two categories: Competing Registrants and Non-Competing Registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Registrant got their domain name before 9am on Wednesday 30 May, 2012, and no one else registered that same name in another second level category before this date, they are non-competing Registrants. Those who fall into this category will be informed of this. These people will be given the option to register their name in a preferential registration period, or reserve their name for up to two years at no charge. DNCL research shows that over 90% of existing names are in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If two or more Registrants registered a domain name under different second levels &amp;ndash; and they did so before 9am on Wednesday 30 May, 2012 &amp;ndash; they will be considered a &amp;lsquo;Competing Registrant&amp;rsquo;. An example of this would be one person having anyname.co.nz and a second person having anyname.net.nz. Anyone who falls into this category will be informed of this fact. Without going into too much detail, these people would either get consent from the other registrants and register their
domain name at the second level or give up their rights to it altogether. Please note that even if they give up their rights to their name at the second level, they will continue to be able to use their existing .nz domain name. If no agreement can be reached and the
name remains conflicted, then no one will be able to register it. Our research shows less than 10% of names fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, though, the final consultation policy &amp;ndash; which will outline what will happen to all .nz registrants &amp;ndash; won&amp;rsquo;t happen until early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people not in the industry probably wonder why .NZ didn&amp;rsquo;t exist from the start&amp;mdash;it seems to a far superior TLD than .CO.NZ. Can you talk us through that history a bit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; The background to the .nz domain name space stems from when Waikato University ran the .nz domain name space. In fact, in the early days a consortium of universities made decisions around the structure of .nz.  Later, InternetNZ entered into an arrangement with ICANN to hold delegation over the .nz domain name space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of other countries at the time, registrations at the third level were common practice and had precedents in other email addressing systems in operation at the time in the UK and Europe. Our understanding is that the original hierarchical structure was intended to differentiate the ccTLDs from the gTLDs such as .com and other ones
around at the time. In the years that have passed, however, things have changed. Indeed, a number of other countries have also changed their policies to allow registrations directly at the second level and New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s doing the same will introduce a format to .nz that is common with many other ccTLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, it easy to look back and think about how improvements might have been made.  Armed with this knowledge, if we were starting today we probably would do things differently. For
open registrations we probably would have allowed registrations at the second level from day one. However, we also believe there is a place for moderated spaces like .govt and .health and we would keep this policy for similarly appropriate bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the changes we&amp;rsquo;re making today we think we are offering the best of both worlds and that allowing registrations at the second and third level will allow people to identify with existing second levels or dissociate with them if they don&amp;rsquo;t. For example, businesses can still identify themselves as a company by using .co.nz and oganisations can do the same with .org.nz. However if you&amp;rsquo;re neither of these things &amp;ndash; and no other second level speaks to you &amp;ndash; you could go straight to registering at the second level. From our perspective, this approach offers more choice and benefits to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And finally, aside from launching .NZ, tell us more about what DNC does and how it is different from NZRS and InternetNZ. What are the big issues of today and tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick:&lt;/strong&gt; InternetNZ (Internet New Zealand Inc) manages the .nz domain name space and established two subsidiary companies, Domain Name Commission Ltd (DNCL) and NZ Domain Name Registry Ltd (NZRS), to carry out the
management and day-to-day operations. This leaves the InternetNZ Council to maintain a governance overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNCL is responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the .nz domain name registration and management system.  NZRS is responsible for the register of domain names and the operation of the Domain Name System (DNS) in the .nz domain name space&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far and away DNCL&amp;rsquo;s biggest issue right now is .nz registrations directly at the second level. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s the most significant policy change in our history and we received more submissions on this issue than any previous consultation process. Co-ordinating this change, allowing for the technical aspects of it and alerting the public to the change will no doubt take up much of our focus for 2014. Another priority for us is encouraging Registrars towards DNSSEC-friendly status so that .nz domain name holders are both safer
and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>An Interview With Ben Crawford, CEO of CentralNic</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-12-10-Screen_Shot_2013-12-09_at_12.27.38.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2013-12-09 at 12.27.38.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.centralnic.com&#34;&gt;CentralNic&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest domain registries, currently distributing popular domain names such as .uk.com, .us.com and .cn.com. But their portfolio is rapidly expanding with 60 &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; coming soon, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wiki&#34;&gt;.wiki&lt;/a&gt;, .bar and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&#34;&gt;.xyz&lt;/a&gt;. To get some insight into this expansion, we reached out to Ben Crawford, CEO of CentralNic and asked a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; The elephant in the TLD room is obviously &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;. As fun and creative as other TLDs are, people keep going back for more of the old standby. What do you think the turning point will be to make alternative TLDs hit mass acceptance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternative TLDs have already hit mass acceptance, and there are three reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, domains like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&#34;&gt;.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&#34;&gt;.de&lt;/a&gt;, and even SLD (&amp;ldquo;second level domain&amp;rdquo;) extensions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&#34;&gt;.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; have all sold over 10 million domains, because they have a specific meaning that is different from .com &amp;ndash; if you want to let people know you are a not-for-profit, or a German business, or a British business, then those domains are much better than .com. And there is no doubt that some of the new gTLDs will also be a more suitable domain extension than .com for large numbers of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, with 110 million .com domains registered, good domains are not available with .com endings, or only available on the secondary market for hundreds, thousands, even millions of dollars. So alternatives to .com like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/us.com-american-domain-name-registration-for-united-states-of-america&#34;&gt;.us.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&#34;&gt;.biz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&#34;&gt;.info&lt;/a&gt; already sell in large numbers too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is proven demand for domains at a lower cost than .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Of all the TLDs you have coming out in the near future, which ones do you have the highest hopes for? And why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that the domains that sell in the highest numbers won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily be the the most profitable ones. That said, the ones we expect to sell the most of are our generics like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&#34;&gt;.xyz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-website&#34;&gt;.website&lt;/a&gt;, which are suitable for any kind of site, and will also be price competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the hurdles we&amp;rsquo;ve seen with domain extensions is general public awareness. Do you have any plans in place to get your new TLDs into the public lexicon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; Marketing is absolutely one of the keys to success for any new domain extension. We encourage and often assist our clients in reaching out directly to their potential registrants through trade press, exhibitions, direct marketing, and other channels, depending on their target markets. For instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-college&#34;&gt;.college&lt;/a&gt; is being promoted in the education sector, .bar and .rest for restaurants are being promoted to the food service industry, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ink&#34;&gt;.ink&lt;/a&gt; in the tattoo world, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press&#34;&gt;.press&lt;/a&gt; to the media, and so on. On top of that, we provide our registrars with marketing materials for all of our domains, to help them introduce and launch our TLDs to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; CentralNic is known for alternative extensions such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gb.com-british-domain-name-registration-for-great-britain&#34;&gt;gb.com&lt;/a&gt;, us.com or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu.com-domain-name-registration-for-european-union&#34;&gt;eu.com&lt;/a&gt;. What percentage of your business do you expect to come from new TLDs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; CentralNic actually supports three different domain extension types, and we expect growth from all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our distribution platform currently supports around 30 SLD extensions. Our latest launches include .mex.com for Mexico, .in.net for India, and .africa.com, and we plan to continue adding many more, as we only see the demand increasing for geography-specific and other alternative domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also supporting an increasing number of ccTLDs on our platform, as we offer a unique solution for country codes, with proven successes in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&#34;&gt;.la&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pw-palauan-domain-name-registration-for-palau&#34;&gt;.pw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage we have fourteen uncontested gTLDs that we will be the exclusive distributor for, and we have more than thirty more still in contention. Our new TLDs include some of the best domain extensions ever launched, and our partners include some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the domain industry, so we do expect these domains to be our most successful to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Last but not least (and because we get the question all the time), when do you expect the first of your domain extensions going live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ll start rolling them out in Q1 2014, starting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wiki&#34;&gt;.wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kiwi Code Retreat - Advancing The Art Of Coding Software</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest post by Aimee Whitcroft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coming Saturday December 14th, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; is really happy to be sponsoring the Wellington &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/142880662/&#34;&gt;Kiwi Code Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalday.coderetreat.org/&#34;&gt;Global Day of Coderetreat&lt;/a&gt;, in which thousands of software developers in well over a hundred cities spend the day practicing their craft &amp;ndash; code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy Palamountain, who is organiser and co-host with her partner Martin Holman, likens the retreat to the practice time put in by musicians. When musicians perform, the audience is amazed and thrilled by the musicians&amp;rsquo; mastery of their chosen instrument, but of course you don&amp;rsquo;t see the hours and years of practice put in behind the scenes. Hence the retreat. Says Amy: &amp;ldquo;Building software is a very creative endeavour, yet we go to work every day and essentially perform. We practice our craft often during the performance itself (if that makes sense!).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She goes on to say: &amp;ldquo;How much better would we be at our craft if we actually put time into practice &amp;ndash; practice with no consequence? No client waiting for a solution, no expectations, just time to push your craft to the next level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day will be split into six blocks, with coders changing partners for each block. Everyone is given a problem to work on, and a constraint that is added into the mix. At the end of each session, all traces of the code are deleted &amp;ndash; the point being to stretch one&amp;rsquo;s coding muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy knows what she&amp;rsquo;s talking about when it comes to code &amp;ndash; from Wellington originally, she&amp;rsquo;s been coding professionally for 6+ years, speaks regularly at schools and conferences, and is just about to start at &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;! She says she &amp;ldquo;loves being part of a community of people who write code; people who make things&amp;rdquo;, and can&amp;rsquo;t wait for this weekend. Martin works at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mindscapehq.com/&#34;&gt;MindScape&lt;/a&gt;, building an error reporting service called RayGun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked why they&amp;rsquo;re hosting this year&amp;rsquo;s event? &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re both firm believers in software craftsmanship, and that the values of writing great code transcend the language you program in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And it&amp;rsquo;s such a great way to meet and hang out with a bunch of Wellington&amp;rsquo;s top programmers!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more, and we&amp;rsquo;re really proud to be sponsoring this year&amp;rsquo;s event, especially having recently marked &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/happy-5th-birthday-iwantmyname.html&#34;&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt; of being part of the Wellington tech community. We hope you enjoy it as much as we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed supporting it. [btw &amp;ndash; if you are based north of the Bombay hills, have no fear! There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/142664562/&#34;&gt;Auckland version&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Four-Letter .COMs Are A Four-Letter Word--Gone</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-12-05-bigstock-Sold-Out-Rubber-Stamp-43310818.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bigstock-Sold-Out-Rubber-Stamp-43310818.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/04/four_letter_domain_names_zero_unclaimed_llll_dot_coms_left_on_the_internet.html&#34;&gt;From Will Oremus &amp;ndash; Slate:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not just talking about four-letter names that spell actual words, like cars.com or pets.com (R.I.P). We&amp;rsquo;re not even just talking about pronounceable four-letter combinations, like eBay, Yelp, Etsy, and Hulu. We&amp;rsquo;re talking every possible four-letter combination, from aaaa.com to zzzz.com. That&amp;rsquo;s a total of 456,976 combinations. &lt;a href=&#34;http://whoapi.com/blog/1413/we-are-out-of-4-letter-com-domains/&#34;&gt;WhoAPI&lt;/a&gt; checked all 456,976 of them, and confirmed that not one remains unregistered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing the new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) are coming soon. With hundreds to choose from, there will be plenty of great four-letter options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you have one in mind, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;pre-orders for many of the new gTLDs are open now&lt;/a&gt;. Go take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>For Our Birthday, We&#39;re Giving Back (And You Should Too)</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is turning five this week&amp;mdash;a remarkable feat for any online business. And with a great staff, wonderful community support and unbelievably loyal customers, we&amp;rsquo;re excited about what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mark the occasion, we&amp;rsquo;re making a small but very significant change. From this week on, we&amp;rsquo;re going to donate 10 cents from each domain registered to global aid initiatives. It&amp;rsquo;s a small amount to begin with, but it&amp;rsquo;s a sustainable way we can celebrate our good fortune by giving back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Donation Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound odd for a tech company to have a donation strategy; but we feel that we have a social responsibility to make a positive contribution in the world outside of our immediate sphere of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s also really important to make sure our aid money is put to good use. So we did quite a bit of research on &lt;a href=&#34;http://charitynavigator.org&#34;&gt;charitynavigator.org&lt;/a&gt; to find a charity that spends a high portion of its budget on programs and services, not executive boards and administration. We also wanted to support significant global causes, since our customers come from nearly every country on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Our First Charity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-12-05-save-the-children.png&#34; alt=&#34;Save The Children&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a nearly perfect &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;amp;orgid=4438&#34;&gt;Charity Navigator score&lt;/a&gt;, as well as impressively using 91.7% of its budget on programs and services, we&amp;rsquo;ve selected &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savethechildren.org&#34;&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt; as our first charity of choice. More specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s our intention to support the fantastic work that Save The Children is doing right now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6150549/&#34;&gt;on the ground in typhoon ravaged Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But please don&amp;rsquo;t let our donation be the end of the story however. If you&amp;rsquo;re able, &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8855857/k.E53D/Donate_to_the_Typhoon_Haiyan_Childrens_Relief_Fund/apps/ka/sd/donor.asp&#34;&gt;please consider donating what you can&lt;/a&gt; to their global cause. It would make us happier than anything to inspire someone to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once again, thank you so much for supporting us for the last five years. We appreciate it more than you know.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An Interview About .GURU With Mason Cole, VP Communications of Donuts Inc.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-28-Screen_Shot_2013-11-27_at_16.07.37.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2013-11-27 at 16.07.37.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much to our surprise, .GURU is the single most popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD)&lt;/a&gt; pre-ordered so far on iwantmyname. So we went to the underlying registry, Donuts Inc., to ask a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Mason, thanks for doing this with us. So first off, tell us a bit about .GURU. What&amp;rsquo;s its origin story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Donuts examined about 3,000 potential gTLDs for which to apply and narrowed that list to our eventual 307. According to the data we examined, there&amp;rsquo;s pretty good demand in the market for various specific domain names, including .GURU. It&amp;rsquo;s not that we had a particular affinity for the term (though we do like it) &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s more that we learned there are potential registrants who would like to use the name for all kinds of reasons. And we&amp;rsquo;re in the business of supplying new and varied Internet identity options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve seen a surprising amount of interest in .GURU specifically&amp;mdash;how much realistic growth potential do you see there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, your numbers are telling you the story.  Suffice to say we would not have put $185,000 into an application if we didn&amp;rsquo;t think it had a reasonable amount of potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people are excited about the new gTLDs, but we&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a bit of cynicism online. Do you think the world is ready? Will these gTLDs succeed in &amp;ldquo;categorizing the web?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the world is ready. The cynicism, we believe, is unwarranted and probably comes with the discomfort in general associated with disruption. When you have a worn out and tired .COM namespace with no reasonable naming options left, new and specific, relevant identity opportunities will be very welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; From a marketing perspective, what would be the biggest win for .GURU? A successful blog using the TLD? A startup website?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; Our measure of use success is that applied by the registrant. If a registrant puts .GURU to use in a way that&amp;rsquo;s productive for his/her needs, it&amp;rsquo;s a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; The internet is quite an interesting place, but I think it&amp;rsquo;ll get much more interesting once .COM isn&amp;rsquo;t the norm for the &amp;ldquo;everyday web surfer.&amp;rdquo; What obstacles do you think need to be overcome to get us there? And what can the early tech adopters do to help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mason:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a little while at least until the typical registrant learns the ins and outs of new gTLDs. That&amp;rsquo;s to be expected. That said, new gTLDs will be far more intuitive and relevant to those who are looking for specificity in describing products, services, activities, information, etc. Some early adopters will make their registrations extremely prominent in their advertising and consumer-facing communications. That kind of validation will help ease new TLDs into broad use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Donuts Inc. on Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DonutsInc&#34;&gt;@DonutsInc&lt;/a&gt;. And remember, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&#34;&gt;pre-ordering is open for .GURU domains&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>10 Big Brands Using Domain Hacks For URL Shortening On Twitter</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-23-Screen_Shot_2013-11-22_at_14.46.31.png&#34; alt=&#34;StarWars Tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you want to say on Twitter, you only get 140 characters to say it. On one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason Twitter has been so successful&amp;mdash;it mercilessly removes fluff from online writing. But when it comes to sharing links, 140 characters can really cramp your style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this, you can shorten them using a number of generic link-shortening platforms. But if you&amp;rsquo;re ambitious, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-tools-we-use-bitly-for-link-shortening.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;brand&lt;/em&gt; your links with Bitly&lt;/a&gt; using a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&#34;&gt;domain hack&lt;/a&gt;, like our personal favorite, &lt;a href=&#34;http://iwnt.my&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;iwnt.my&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inspiration, here are ten influential brands using custom link shortening for their Twitter links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Wars &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://archived.link/http://strw.rs&#34;&gt;strw.rs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be&#34;&gt;youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bon Appetit &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://bonapp.it&#34;&gt;bonapp.it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://di.sn&#34;&gt;nyti.ms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chobani &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://cho.ba&#34;&gt;cho.ba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolling Stone &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rol.st&#34;&gt;rol.st&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Verge &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vrge.co&#34;&gt;vrge.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virgin &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://virg.in&#34;&gt;virg.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BBC &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://bbc.in&#34;&gt;bbc.in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pepsi &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://pep.si&#34;&gt;pep.si&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Philippines Typhoon: How You Can Help</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-14-haiyan2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;haiyan2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines may have quite possibly suffered its worst natural disaster in recent history as Super Typhoon Haiyan passed directly across the tropical Western Pacific archipelago. If you are struggling to comprehend the enormous power unleashed by a storm of this magnitude, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24906576&#34;&gt;this BBC video report&lt;/a&gt;
 filmed during the onslaught, when winds were reportedly gusting over 185 m.p.h (300 km/hr)! The full extent of the disaster is not yet clear, with reports of a death toll anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 and literally millions displaced. So, how can we help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Pacific rim nations such as Japan, Taiwan, United States, New Zealand and Chile are well acquainted with natural disasters such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html&#34;&gt;tropical storms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-photos/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503036&#34;&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure we can all
empathize with this tragedy. But we may also be feeling a little powerless to help. A while ago we were delighted to add the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html&#34;&gt;Philippines domain&lt;/a&gt; to our registrar offerings; so it only seems right to contribute something back at this difficult time. Children suffer most of all during a disaster, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; has made an immediate cash donation to UNICEF today. This is a relief agency established within the United Nations to support children at risk globally. The American Red Cross also has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redcross.org/donate/index.jsp?donateStep=2&amp;amp;itemId=prod4650031&#34;&gt;special fund&lt;/a&gt; aimed specifically at getting resources into the affected region. If you wish to donate anonymously, you can do so by using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=2663&#34;&gt;Givealittle&lt;/a&gt; platform and selecting your preferred recipient relief agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this tragedy continues to unfold, it is difficult not to feel great concern for the Philippines nation which has already suffered so much this year with numerous storms and earthquakes. As a business based in the Asia-Pacific region we feel a social responsibility to contribute; it&amp;rsquo;s a sentiment that we have backed up by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html&#34;&gt;participating directly&lt;/a&gt; in aid programmes in the past. I hope you will join us and give what you can to the people of the Philippines. Even a small financial donation can go a long way in times of need.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Zachary Crockett, Founder And CTO Of Spark</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&#34;embed-responsive-item&#34; src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/67698662?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Crockett, thanks for doing this with us! So I&amp;rsquo;ll jump right to it&amp;mdash;Spark is really really cool, and we think more people should know about it. Give us the rundown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; We make tools to help people build internet-connected hardware products. Our first product, the Spark Core (video above), is a small development kit for a hardware product with a Wi-Fi connection. Think appliances, toys, home security and monitoring. It&amp;rsquo;s a fork of Arduino, so folks who have done hardware prototyping with an Arduino would be comfortable with the Spark Core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Your domain is also quite cool&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spark.io&#34;&gt;spark.io&lt;/a&gt;. Tell us a little about how you guys came to choosing a .io domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; .io domains are being used more and more frequently in the world of developer tools, and since that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re building, .io seemed very appropriate for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; What would you tell another site owner looking into a non-.com domain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the stigma around non-.com domains is gone because there are so many great start-ups using other TLDs. However there are still &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;not cool&amp;rdquo; TLDs, and they vary by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And what about Kickstarter? We&amp;rsquo;ve seen some amazing projects come through with Kickstarter funding&amp;mdash;how was that process? Exciting? Horrifying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; Exciting :&amp;ndash;) Kickstarter is a wonderful vehicle to launch a product, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible&#34;&gt;Kickstarter community&lt;/a&gt; is so supportive. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten incredible feedback from our backers that have made our product so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; It looks like the target shipment date for Spark Core is November 18th? Where can we get one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-order now at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spark.io&#34;&gt;spark.io&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Zachary on Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/towynlin&#34;&gt;@towynlin&lt;/a&gt;. Also, follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sparkdevices&#34;&gt;@sparkdevices&lt;/a&gt; for all the latest news and happenings at Spark.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>No Upselling Tactics To Be Found Here</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine upselling lessons we can learn from domain registrars &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/ghr9w593JM&#34;&gt;http://t.co/ghr9w593JM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Econsultancy (@Econsultancy) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Econsultancy/statuses/395926822254571520&#34;&gt;October 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came across this post last week from Econsultancy titled, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://econsultancy.com/nz/blog/63696-nine-upselling-lessons-we-can-learn-from-domain-registrars&#34;&gt;Nine upselling lessons we can learn from domain registrars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. And being a company that strictly refrains from gimmicky upselling tactics, we have a few things to say about it. And our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upsells should be priced low enough to be an impulse buy. When offering an upsell, make it a price point that appears to the user as significantly cheaper than the original product they were buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-07-namecheap-shopping-cart.png&#34; alt=&#34;namecheap-shopping-cart.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at the mess in this basket. $2 here. $3.33/mo there. At iwantmyname, we don&amp;rsquo;t try to nitpick you with upsells in your cart. A domain is a domain, and our prices are set to provide the best balance of value and support we can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present the upsell as benefits to the user. By highlighting the benefits of a product, rather than its features, customers will understand what it offers them and will be more likely to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-07-crazydomains_certification.png&#34; alt=&#34;crazydomains_certification.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a trick many online businesses use to upsell&amp;mdash;providing services that users don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand as a scare tactic. The example here shows a Domain Certification that can be purchased at extra cost, complete with a paragraph of the benefits it can provide for your business. And for many users, that sort of add-on might sound reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is that when you purchase a domain, it&amp;rsquo;s registered to you through the underlying registry for a year&amp;mdash;no phony certification needed. Tricking your customers into purchasing add-ons just isn&amp;rsquo;t the way to do business on the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage the user to choose between options. When customers are purchasing, there is a general inertia. They will usually take the path of least resistance. By offering a choice (such as different levels of hosting), the user must make a conscious decision between the options rather than being able to just ignore the upsell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to go with a minimum-tier purchase, so at iwantmyname, we don&amp;rsquo;t give options. If you want a service like &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184425-do-you-offer-a-whois-privacy-service-&#34;&gt;whois masking&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s entirely free. Nor do we try to provide second-rate services to inflate our offerings. If you need email hosting or a platform to build a site, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is filled with powerful options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use price psychology. It is a similar situation to choosing a wine in a restaurant, where people are reluctant to choose the cheapest bottle, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to pick the &amp;lsquo;premium&amp;rsquo; option. It gives them an easy compromise choice that is neither the most basic, nor too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true that many registrars play into people&amp;rsquo;s psyches to boost a purchase, but we don&amp;rsquo;t look for upsells. Ever. And we make an active effort to keep all the content on our site clear and concise. At iwantmyname, the value of our service comes from honest simplicity, not how many cheap add-ons we can throw in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer the user an unbeatable deal. When trying to upsell, offering a compelling offer may encourage users to engage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using bundled sales as a marketing strategy could take up a post on its own, but put simply, the only &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&#34;&gt;discounts we offer&lt;/a&gt; are for single domains, and they usually only come when we are offered a short-term price fluctuation from the underlying registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the differences between options clear. Make higher cost packages appear more comprehensive by showing icons or checklists (and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to explain what these additional features are, if it&amp;rsquo;s not clear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-07-register-options.png&#34; alt=&#34;register-options.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re probably starting to sound like a broken record here, but if you find yourself questioning the complexity of your purchase because of a confusing sales pitch, it may be time to find a new registrar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t increase time or number of items without asking the user. A better approach to this would be to give the user the option to increase their term, while offering strong benefits (better pricing, added value services or the benefit of not forgetting to renew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy a domain through us, what you&amp;rsquo;re purchasing is really easy to understand. You get the selected domain for one year for the price displayed. No sneaky deals. No confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a long term approach to upselling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or decide not to upsell at all. Our mission at iwantmyname is to help you get the web address you want as quickly as possible and not squeeze the last cent out of everything. We think our customers prefer it our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently came across this one too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/Rb308GgfC5&#34;&gt;http://t.co/Rb308GgfC5&lt;/a&gt; upsells and cross-sells its customers &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/CGCWyrfG0V&#34;&gt;http://t.co/CGCWyrfG0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DomainNameWire.com (@DomainNameWire) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DomainNameWire/statuses/398123985226842112&#34;&gt;November 6, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was a customer calling us, who bought — who saw our TV ads, they would be buying our new custom website product, which has almost 10 different products bundled together and it gives them everything they need to get found on the first page of a local Google search. And so then they&amp;rsquo;re going to get follow-up phone calls talking about things like Facebook and some of our other enhanced products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than all else, we promise to never upsell you over the phone. If you like our service, we&amp;rsquo;d be honored to have you as a repeat customer, but we&amp;rsquo;ll never be pushy with high-pressure or annoying phone calls. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On Perfecting Workplace Culture</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we place a high priority on having fun, constantly working on things everyone is passionate about and not treating each other like resources on a Gantt chart. It&amp;rsquo;s what drives us to do good work. To make cool things we believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are so many intangibles that go into creating a great office culture, and new ideas and philosophies are being written about every day. Here are a few of the things we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at this week:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Three Steps To Get The Most From Your Custom Short URL Using Bitly And Buffer</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your Twitter feed and you&amp;rsquo;ll likely see how pervasive custom short URLs are becoming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.J. Abrams on Star Wars: Episode VII: the saga may return to its gritty, &amp;quot;space western&amp;quot; roots &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/j26xKC6n6h&#34;&gt;http://t.co/j26xKC6n6h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; The Verge (@verge) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/verge/statuses/397753405130559488&#34;&gt;November 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a trend we&amp;rsquo;re seeing more and more of, and it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic way to brand your social content. And best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s a simple task to accomplish using Bitly and Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get A Short Domain Name.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to branding your social posts is to get a shortened domain name. For instance, if you look above you&amp;rsquo;ll see daringfireball.com (18 characters) shortened to df4.us (6 characters). The goal here is to make the most of your 140 characters on Twitter by limiting the length of your links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So set your sights for &lt;a href=&#34;http://iwmn.me/VSOb/5mCr9l3O&#34;&gt;iwmn.me/VSOb/5mCr9l3O&lt;/a&gt; to get a custom short domain that&amp;rsquo;ll be automatically setup for Bitly. The key is to make it short, uncomplicated and related to your brand name—whether it be your company or personal brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you already have an iwantmyname domain name, just login and head over to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, choose Bitly, then hit Install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Get Your Bitly Account.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your custom domain, head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitly.com&#34;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; and get an account. Then, in settings, you can set up your custom short domain for personal or business use. The setup is super simple, and because you already have the custom domain setup through iwantmyname, your work here is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Get Buffer.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a social media manager or someone in charge of posting for a number of social platforms at once, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bufferapp.com&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; is an invaluable tool. In one place, you can manage Twitter, Facebook, Google+, App.net and Linkedin, and see a host of stats on how your posts are performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what makes Buffer truly amazing is its integration with third-party platforms—like Bitly. To set up your Bitly service, simply go to Settings, then Link Shortening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you go to post a link (or automatically post from your blog), Buffer will automatically shorten your link to your chosen custom short name, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Steps To Get The Most From Your Custom Short URL Using Bitly And Buffer &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/GQzOkMDIsa&#34;&gt;http://t.co/GQzOkMDIsa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; iwantmyname (@iwantmyname) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iwantmyname/statuses/397791387275366400&#34;&gt;November 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fiji Time: Working From An Island In The Pacific Ocean</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-01-the-iwmn-office.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;iwantmyname Fiji office&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iwantmyname team just got back from a two-week stay in Fiji where we spent time together working, brainstorming and dreaming big. Why Fiji, you ask? As you may know, our company is based in New Zealand, and the Pacific island nation is just a short 2.5 hour flight from here, making it an affordable destination for a team outing. One of our goals when launching iwantmyname almost 5 years ago was to set up the company in a way so that we could work completely independent of our location (as long as there&amp;rsquo;s an internet connection), so we wanted to put our goal to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 13 we left on two separate flights from Auckland to Nadi, Fiji. Our first stop after landing was a local telco shop at the airport to buy local SIM cards for data. The plan was to set up our own wireless network over 3G and use simple tethering via our phones as a backup option. As you can imagine, good internet connectivity is crucial for us, so a side reason for picking Fiji is because of their direct connection to an undersea data cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-01-fiji-speedtest.png&#34; alt=&#34;fiji-speedtest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools we used to create our own network were two &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sapido.com.tw/EN/productmb1132o_35g.htm&#34;&gt;Sapido MB-1132 3G/4G travel routers&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huaweidevice.com/worldwide/productFeatures.do?pinfoId=2940&amp;amp;directoryId=5008&amp;amp;treeId=582&amp;amp;tab=0&#34;&gt;Huawei E372 USB sticks&lt;/a&gt; connected to an external antenna, which gave us enough bandwidth to do work. We&amp;rsquo;ve been using the same setup all over New Zealand while traveling, camping and backpacking already, and Vodafone Fiji didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint with their 3G speed. Prices were reasonable too, with ~$40 USD for 6 GB of data, which you could top up online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everything in place, we kicked off our first week just as if we were at our normal office. The only difference was the warm weather, the pool and the ocean waves just in front of our house, which we made use of extensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideegeo/sets/72157637176202473/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-01-flickr-set.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fiji Flickr Set&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a break in Fiji? Just jump in the pool or go for a swim, snorkle or kayak in the crystal-clear ocean. This helped us tremendously to get our minds off the tasks we planned to achieve during our stay (e.g. after staring at a screen for hours, writing complicated code or fixing bugs). The main goal for this trip was to automate the last bits and pieces of our system, improve internal admin tools and performing some cleanup tasks. Quite often our workflow looked like &amp;ldquo;git push &amp;gt; deploy &amp;gt; jump in pool&amp;rdquo;. It was such an intense, focused and productive two weeks, and having the team in a beautiful and relaxed work environment certainly made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we also explored the island, with the highlight being a hiking trip to a local waterfall. Check out the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHU8WciU_6Q&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some of us got sick after trying some local specialties in week two, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop us from enjoying the rest of our stay. I&amp;rsquo;d say on a tropical island it just adds to the experience&amp;hellip; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had clear goals that we wanted to achieve and we hit most of them. But more importantly, the team got closer to each other by sharing rooms, cooking meals together and just having a good time. It went so well, we&amp;rsquo;re planning to go on team outings like this on a yearly basis now. Would we go to Fiji again? Certainly! It&amp;rsquo;s close to New Zealand, affordable and offers good internet connectivity for a remote island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to come with us next year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/jobs/backend-developer&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re hiring&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Droplr For Sharing Files And Taking Screenshots</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For a bigger, more updated look at Droplr, head over to our new post, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/08/droplr-is-an-exceptionally-useful-tool.html&#34;&gt;Droplr is an exceptionally useful tool for sharing files and screenshots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-02-screen800x500.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Droplr&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;a href=&#34;https://droplr.com/hello&#34;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt;, this was a pretty typical conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, take a look at the box in the bottom right corner of your screen.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m on my phone. I think I&amp;rsquo;m seeing something different.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you see what&amp;rsquo;s happening on this page?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not happening on my browser.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a million reasons why someone would need to send a screenshot, and with Droplr, there&amp;rsquo;s now an incredibly easy way to send one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Droplr Mac, Windows or iOS App (or a number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://droplr.com/hello#&#34;&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt;), taking a screenshot is as easy as hitting a hotkey combo, drawing a box anywhere on the screen, then sharing the URL Droplr provides of the image you took. You can also use Droplr to shorten links in your browser, write and share PlainText/Markdown drafts of documents, share code and send large files with Droplr and send them to anyone you please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, it may be the easiest platform for sharing files on the internet, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for $5.99/mo, &lt;a href=&#34;https://droplr.com/hello#pro&#34;&gt;Droplr Pro&lt;/a&gt; gives you advanced statistics, the ability to share files up to 1GB and custom domains for the files you send. For a business, sending links with custom short domain names (like iwmn.me) is always nice touch of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Drew Wilson, Co-Creator Of Roon</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-11-01-roon-520.png&#34; alt=&#34;roon-520.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks so much for chatting! First off, tell me a little about what makes Roon a great blog platform for someone like me—a guy who just wants to blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for the opportunity! Roon was built to make it super easy to go from sign up to your first published post as fast as you can type. There are no settings to configure before posting your content and it&amp;rsquo;ll look great on all devices. We do have optional settings for those who&amp;rsquo;d like to customize their Roon blog a bit, but he interface and the platform was designed to put all the focus on the writing experience and not the level of visual customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roon also doesn&amp;rsquo;t claim ownership over your content as other platforms do, and you can export your entire blog at anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of platforms lately go practically CMS-free, but Roon has a web app, an iOS app and a Mac app on the way. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty impressive lineup! Do you think it makes for a better user experience that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; 100%! Writing in a native app is a much better experience than writing in a web app. Giving people the options to use these native apps for free only makes the Roon platform that much more convenient and really sets it apart from all the other competitors out there. Native apps are also quicker to pull up, making it more convenient to jot ideas down as drafts when they come to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems that every day I see a new Twitter post screaming &amp;ldquo;DON&amp;rsquo;T READ THE COMMENTS.&amp;rdquo; Given that Roon doesn&amp;rsquo;t have comments for posts, give me your thoughts on author/audience interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; We purposefully did not add traditional comments to Roon because they aren&amp;rsquo;t the right way for authors to engage and converse with their readers. Twitter is a much better platform for comments than a traditional comment thread at the bottom of a post because it forces people to be concise with what they say. We plan to move beyond Twitter and implement our own commenting system to Roon in the future, but it will not be a traditional comment thread system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So Roon is free at the moment, and that always scares me a bit. Will Roon always be free?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; Roon will always be free, with various features available as paid upgrades. We already have two paid upgrades: Custom Domains and Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom Domains gets you the ability to run room on your own domain. Analytics enables you to add in 3rd party analytics tracking, like GoSquared or Google Analytics. We&amp;rsquo;ll be adding more Roon specific tracking the Analytics package soon. We also have a few more paid upgrades that will launch soon. Blogging on Roon will always be free though, as will our native apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And finally, what does the future look like for Roon? Any amazing new features coming soon? Plans for world domination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew:&lt;/strong&gt; We have tons of great plans for Roon. But both Sam and I know the full future of Roon will be something we can&amp;rsquo;t predict. Just like most other platforms, the community has a huge part in the future of the product. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to see where that leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just around the corner we&amp;rsquo;ll be launching Multi-Blog. Everyone will be able to manage multiple blogs under their one username. You&amp;rsquo;ll have a dedicated blog URL for each of your blogs, as well as a new &amp;ldquo;User Page&amp;rdquo; that will be a mash up of all your posts from all your blogs combined. Multi-Blog will be free for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that we&amp;rsquo;ll be launching Discovery. It will be available on the web and in our native apps and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to browse posts from others. Discovery will bring the Roon community together and will make it easy for you to find and read posts written by others that you&amp;rsquo;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we&amp;rsquo;re just focused on making a great platform for people to write great content and not worry about spending time to make it look good. We take care of it all for you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With iwantmyname Customer Lee Crossley</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-10-30-A6clKGTCQAA75He.jpg-large.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lee Crossley Big&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Lee, thanks for doing our very first user interview! So first, tell me a bit about yourself and what you&amp;rsquo;re up to these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m a full stack developer and general level-headed guy, who gets the job done right and on time. For the past 5 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been the technical director at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clickinnovate.com&#34;&gt;Click Innovate&lt;/a&gt;. I love to attend hack events and contribute to open source as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So you just got a new domain. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind me asking, what is it? And what are you using it for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve registered a few domains with iwantmyname and this most recent one was for a mobile based assassin game called &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/77907408&#34;&gt;appsassin&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;appsass.in&amp;rdquo;. It was registered for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ilee.co.uk/yet-another-hackathon-victory/&#34;&gt;hack event I&amp;rsquo;ve just won&lt;/a&gt;. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t love a game where you assassinate other players with your mobile phone? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Congrats on your win! So here&amp;rsquo;s a deep one. ICANN is just now starting to roll out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (extensions like .blog, .music and .dad). Give me some thoughts. Think they&amp;rsquo;ll take off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; Good question. I think there will always be a primary urge to snap up a &amp;ldquo;.com,&amp;rdquo; but with so many registered I&amp;rsquo;ve recently turned to .io and other TLDs that can incorporate the name. The new TLDs are clearly going to be successful (some more than others), even if only due to current exhaustion. I&amp;rsquo;d register a .app for sure for an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Self promotion time. Tell us something the world should know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; I love to write and record music when I have free/spare time. The last time was in 2010 and &lt;a href=&#34;http://open.spotify.com/track/00k6x6Vzj8OaecWMHTi4is&#34;&gt;you can listen for free on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; And last but not least, what should I eat for dinner tonight? I have a really hard time making these decisions on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee:&lt;/strong&gt; Steak (rare) with chilli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Well said, Lee. Well said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Tim Johnson, CEO Of Dot Kiwi</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-10-24-dot-kiwi-logo-blog.png&#34; alt=&#34;dot-kiwi-logo-blog.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Tim. First off, I love your website, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dot-kiwi.com&#34;&gt;dot-kiwi.com&lt;/a&gt;. The design is nice, the copy is fun, but once .kiwi goes live, do you plan on switching domain extensions. Maybe to something like dot.kiwi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks! The website is a result of a lot of thought and planning &amp;ndash; we want to break industry standards (boring), and reach out to the consumer with a fun and innovative interface that brings life to domain names. We look forward to changing from our current .com URL to one of our very own .kiwi names &amp;ndash; what will it be? Well that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a surprise&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; So let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re working for a smart, dynamic Kiwi company that&amp;rsquo;s looking to move away from the .co.nz extension. From a branding perspective, what makes .kiwi a better fit than .nz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me who said it, but there is a joke in the industry that goes something like this &amp;ldquo;Oh, .com? Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s the domain my dad uses&amp;rdquo;. The joke is subtle, but powerful. New domains like .kiwi represent the fresh and exciting, probably most importantly it also means relevance. The way we see it is that the existing domains are more traditional and corporate, whereas new domains like .kiwi are fun, casual and social. The casual nature will suit SME&amp;rsquo;s and individuals very well, there&amp;rsquo;s been a gaping hole in the market for a long time. Lastly, ccTLDs tend to identify a jurisdiction or geography, .kiwi identifies the people &amp;ndash; that is a very important distinction when it comes to the web, where geography does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Aside from sites in NZ, do you see .kiwi making an international push? I mean if MailChimp can make a chimp popular, do you think you have a chance with a really underrated bird?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Underrated and underestimated indeed &amp;ndash; that is the definition of the challenger and the underdog. We like that position and thrive on the challenge &amp;ndash; I think that is very Kiwi. We will do an international push, we are already doing it. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this interview from Miami, which is the 5th stop on a world tour of 17 cities. As Kiwis we have a story and we are proud of our achievements as a nation. So where better to tell those stories and showcase our achievements than internationally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; From an insider perspective, how did you go from dreaming up .kiwi to making it a reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Like anything you&amp;rsquo;ve got to keep things simple. Just identify what you need to do to launch, figure out what resources you need, and surround yourself with people who are much smarter than you! For Dot Kiwi, we have a great team with a great vision. This has been an almost 3 year process for us with a ridiculous amount of hurdles and challenges &amp;ndash; so if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t maintain our vision, things would have gotten pretty tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Last but not least, when can country loving Kiwis get ahold of their .kiwi domains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim:&lt;/strong&gt; Premium names will be available towards the end of November, trademark holders can apply for domain names by mid-December (Sunrise), early bird (Landrush) will start mid-Feb 2014, then first-come-first-served will start early April 2014. We will also be making a special announcement shortly regarding a limited offer in November&amp;hellip; stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mood for one of your own? &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi&#34;&gt;Pre-order your .KIWI domain today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tools We Use: Bitly For Link Shortening</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-10-18-bitly_logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;bitly_logo.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the origin of the problem*. When Twitter launched not that long ago (can you believe it only started in 2006?), they chose to limit posts to 140 characters. For many, that 140 character limit created a perfect environment for short thoughts and conversations, but it was a nightmare for posting links. I mean, just look at a fairly short link like &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&lt;/code&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s at least a million characters (29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, it became very important to keep these links short. Really short. And by 2009, Twitter started using bitly as their link shortener of choice (they&amp;rsquo;ve since started using t.co for all sites, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly have a custom ring to it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most users, a bitly link looks something like this: bit.ly/xxxxxxx. Basically, it turned any 25+ character link into something around 15. But why would a person or company choose to use bit.ly/xxxxxxx as opposed to something custom. Something branded. For these savvy entities that wanted a branded solution, bitly started offering &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/76740-what-s-a-custom-short-domain-and-why-do-i-want-on&#34;&gt;custom link shortening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How It Works.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process to setup your own shortened link is shockingly simple. First, get your domain at &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service&#34;&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; (if you already have an iwantmyname domain, just install bitly in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitly.com/a/sign_up&#34;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; for a bitly account, go into Settings, click Advanced, then plug in your custom domain. Just keep in mind that to properly use a short domain, you need to get a short domain to pair with the standard domain you&amp;rsquo;re using. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. For our shortened link, we&amp;rsquo;re using iwnt.my (a great example of a short &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html&#34;&gt;domain hack&lt;/a&gt;). Not only is it short—it retains all the branding we know and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to post, you can either shorten your link at bitly.com, download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitly.com/a/tools&#34;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; or use any of the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/228830-how-do-i-connect-my-bitly-account-to-other-social-&#34;&gt;third-party tools&lt;/a&gt; that work with the service (we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://droplr.com&#34;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bufferapp.com/&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, but that&amp;rsquo;s for another post). All work great, but some work better for different workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in doing some link shortening for yourself or your brand, give &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitly.com/&#34;&gt;bitly&lt;/a&gt; a shot. We definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Technically, companies like TinyURL have been in the link shortening business since 2002, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t really become &amp;ldquo;a thing&amp;rdquo; until Twitter came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Short Interview With Damian Sowers, Creator Of Silvrback</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-10-15-damian.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;damian.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Damian. Thanks so much for chatting with us. First off, tell me a bit about yourself and why you started &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.silvrback.com/&#34;&gt;Silvrback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Chris. Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Silvrback to scratch my own itch, so to speak. I really liked the format of Medium, but I disliked a number of things about Medium. Namely, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a blogging platform and I had no ownership over my data and the flow of users. For example, Medium often directs people to other author&amp;rsquo;s articles after they are done reading your piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked certain aspects of Svbtle. So I decided to build a bit of a hybrid system between the two platforms. The goal was to allow people to promote themselves more effectively while providing a beautiful experience for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Content ownership (or ownership in general) is a big deal to us, but what, in your mind, makes ownership such a big priority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; Content ownership is becoming something that more and more users are caring about these days. The legal agreements of many Apps, including Medium, are murky to say the least. If someone is going to spend the time writing an article, they should feel confident that they actually own their own writing. Silvrback gives full ownership to it&amp;rsquo;s users and the legal agreement is extremely simple and easy to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of Medium, it seems that blogs all over the web are quickly moving towards clean, single-column designs with large fonts. Do you see that as a permanent design shift?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there is a trend these days to gravitate towards bigger fonts and clean, one-column designs because it is much more enjoyable to read. People sometimes compare big fonts to children&amp;rsquo;s novels, but the research is showing that most of us prefer that easy-to-read experience. The beginning days of the web were dominated by sites that tried to look as professional as possible, and some people believed that very small font sizes represented professionalism. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if they were trying to make their copy look like a legal textbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing I find very appealing about Silvrback is that it&amp;rsquo;s fully hosted, which makes it simple to get in and go. On the flip side, we&amp;rsquo;re seeing lots of new platforms come out with Dropbox hosting. What are your thoughts on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; Endless tinkering with setups and preferences is something I wanted to spare Silvrback users from. I used to waste so much time in the past customizing Wordpress or Tumblr themes. I think people should spend that time on their writing instead. With regards to Dropbox, I&amp;rsquo;m considering giving users the option to pull markdown documents from their public Dropbox repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok ok. One more question, and it&amp;rsquo;s not about blogging. You seem to be a guy with good taste—what should I eat for dinner tonight? I&amp;rsquo;m starving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damian:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of garlic bread. Start with a whole loaf of Rosemary Ciabatta bread. Then coat the base with a &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; spread of butter/mayonnaise. (mayonnaise is key). Add chopped garlic, basil, and then top is off with three-cheese mexican cheese mix. Bake for 20 minutes and enjoy a little slice of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iwmn:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;hellip; [falls into food delirium]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

				<title>Startup Genesis: Musings Of A Non-Technical Founder</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest post from Oliver Townend writing about his experiences as a web company founder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of 2011 I had an idea for an on-line business that seemed to make perfect sense. It grew out of a situation I have been frustrated by repeatedly in my time as a building contractor. It made use of existing technology and it had a potential target market that grew every time I bothered to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited, finally I had an idea that worked. I brainstormed and refined and built on the basic concept to the point where I had (in my head) a hugely complicated product packed full of exciting features and backed up by some wildly optimistic financial predictions. There was one major problem however: I had no experience of start-ups and absolutely no idea how to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept itself is fine. In theory it works and there is a market for it. But if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t build the product then it would only ever be an unrealised opportunity and one day someone else would do it. I&amp;rsquo;d get grumpy and resent them for it. I needed help. The first step was to tell people about it. Not in a comprehensive market validation way (I didn&amp;rsquo;t read The Lean Startup till much later) but just to get different perspectives, discuss the concept and discover if there was merit in taking it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got myself a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessmentors.org.nz/&#34;&gt;business mentor&lt;/a&gt; and told them about it. I asked around and found a couple of lawyers willing to meet informally and talk through the legal implications. I rang everyone I could think of who could possibly use this product and told them what I was trying to do. Most people recommended someone else to talk to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback was fascinating. Ranging from &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Yes,
I want that, when can I have it?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;No, I see no benefit in that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; and most interestingly &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;I
can&amp;rsquo;t talk to you about that, we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do the same thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The positives maintained my enthusiasm. The negatives forced me to confront my deficiencies. The competitors proved that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only person working on this and I needed to get moving. The hardest conversations revealed previously hidden problems and opportunities that have contributed hugely to the refinement process. Every time I explain or defend my theories I get better at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised several things very quickly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The product needed to be simplified dramatically. What I thought was the key feature had been tried before, was fundamentally flawed and nearly impossible to execute. Another feature I hadn&amp;rsquo;t given much thought to had much more promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) No-one I spoke to was going to blatantly steal my idea, especially the sort of busy, technical people who could if they wanted to. They have other things going on. I have a head start at working on figuring it out, the more I get done on my own the more likely it is that I&amp;rsquo;ll have something valuable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) I had a lot of work to do and no time to do it, I was already running a business and had no spare time to spend working on the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) I needed to talk to a lot more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) I needed collaborators. Technical collaborators&amp;hellip;more about this next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oliver Townend is a builder, a writer and a post-graduate student in the Master of Technology Enterprise programme at Victoria University of Wellington.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Searching For The Perfect Startup Domain Name</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Guest Post by Oliver Townend &amp;mdash; working on his own tech startup:&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of my startup journey has not been coming up with the idea, finding co-founders or testing the idea on end-users. The slowest and most frustrating part so far has been simply choosing a business name and subsequently a domain name that I&amp;rsquo;m prepared to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partly this is due to the evolving nature of what the business is/will be. A larger part of it is purely my indecision and the feeling that getting the name wrong will ultimately be the difference between massive success and catastrophic failure. This will almost certainly not be the case. Plenty of businesses have turned obscure or peculiar domains into household names and others have failed in spite of excellent branding and domains that scream success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a name that not only relates well to the business concept but is memorable, snappy, fun (but not silly), serious (but not boring) and most of all available has become a farcically long process and I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to see why consultants are paid substantial amounts of money to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look through my notebooks and iwantmyname dashboard reveals a bewildering history of domain options, each with its own merit, none considered ultimately good enough. They range from my early .co.nz versions (easily obtainable but not suitably international) to self explanatory, www.getitinwriting.com (too long, plus it has tit in it) to &amp;ldquo;Take a word and stick an animal on the end&amp;rdquo; a la SurveyMonkey and MailChimp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way I&amp;rsquo;ve tried anagram generators, backwards words, made up words and combination words. I&amp;rsquo;ve considered various suffixes, different languages and alternative spellings. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked my co-founders for ideas, my potential customers for feedback and my 6 year old niece for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve become frustrated at people who register and hoard good domain names and realised my hypocrisy when I look at the domains I&amp;rsquo;ve registered and will probably never use. I&amp;rsquo;ve lamented the fact that all the good names are taken and
then been reminded that while 252 million of them have gone, there are a hundred thousand or so new ones added every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m not giving up, and here are the best bits of advice I&amp;rsquo;ve been given:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it, concentrate on creating an awesome business, website or blog. If you are successful, your weird domain name might become your biggest asset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People click on links more than they type in whole website addresses. If you build something worth finding, they&amp;rsquo;ll find you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your mind, make up a list of the potentials and get your colleagues and customers to rate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By all means be random and obscure, but consider pronunciation and make sure you&amp;rsquo;re not accidentally including foreign swear words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If in doubt, stick an animal on the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, have I settled on a domain for my amazing, game changing new online startup? Ask me next week.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Community Warms To Domain Registrar Upstart</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-05-29-warm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;warm.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, with the colder weather driving people indoors, we had a few friends over for a quiet celebration&amp;hellip;as you do. It&amp;rsquo;s been five years since we first formed the company and started writing code to develop &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;; so we really wanted to thank a bunch of people who had helped along the way with advice, support or the odd bit of work that kept us going as we built up the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many start-up companies fall by the wayside long before year five, so it&amp;rsquo;s a testament to a lot of hard work from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&#34;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; plus the loyalty (and patience) of our foundation customers that has driven us forward thus far. Apart from creating new jobs and contributing to the economic recovery we always had a sense that we wanted to build a next generation &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&#34;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; registrar that customers would love and that actually solved some real pain for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to be deeply engaged in our local community and give something back to the people that got behind us from the outset. We really love that we are in a position to do so and remain big fans and supporters of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&#34;&gt;Startup Weekend here in Wellington&lt;/a&gt; and all across New Zealand. We also help out with several tech meetups such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/&#34;&gt;PHP User Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/&#34;&gt;Growth Hacker Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/&#34;&gt;Wellington.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/&#34;&gt;Hackers and Founders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellington.pm.org/&#34;&gt;Perl Mongers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://up.org.nz/&#34;&gt;Unlimited Potential&lt;/a&gt;. As well, we&amp;rsquo;ve recently been involved with a number of initiatives promoting Wellington globally as a digital creative city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in touch with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname New Zealand blog&lt;/a&gt; or through the event listings in the New Zealand &lt;a href=&#34;http://startupdigest.com/&#34;&gt;Startup Digest&lt;/a&gt;. You never know where we might pop up. Keep Warm.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What is DNS? Here&#39;s what you need to know</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re new to building your own website it can feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of things you need to know but you don&amp;rsquo;t really have an idea where to start looking. Luckily &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;we make setting up domains really easy&lt;/a&gt; for hosted services through our iwantmyname marketplace so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about technical details most of the time. If you are trying to delve a bit deeper into the technology involved there are so many acronyms and strange words that it can feel a bit overwhelming however. But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we&amp;rsquo;re here to help clear the air a little and explain what each thing does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Name Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;A Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;CNAME Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;MX Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-6&#34;&gt;TXT Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNS technology touches your life in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-mockapetris/dns-what-celebrating-30-y_b_3211030.html&#34;&gt;many ways you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/a&gt; every day. It stands for &lt;strong&gt;Domain Name System&lt;/strong&gt; which is the technology making it possible for you to type nice, human-friendly words into your address bar like &lt;em&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/em&gt; instead of computer readable IP addresses such as 50.56.80.249.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about DNS is that in this case, &lt;em&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/em&gt; and e.g. &lt;em&gt;50.56.80.249&lt;/em&gt; are the same thing. Try it out for yourself and put 50.56.80.249 into your address bar. It might give you a warning, but should still take you to our front page. DNS is simply that &amp;mdash; it allows computers to translate human readable things, like a URL, into an IP address. If you&amp;rsquo;re not clear on what an IP address is, think of it as a phone number in the phone book. It tells the potential caller where your phone is and how to call you. The phone book provides names so you know who you&amp;rsquo;re calling. DNS does the same thing. It provides a friendly, memorable name, which the DNS associates with a website at the numbered address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re certainly glad this exists, otherwise it would be pretty hard for people to remember to visit us at 50.56.80.249, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Name Server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A name server is a web server with DNS software installed. It&amp;rsquo;s where you manage all of your DNS records and set who your web/email host is. This is the part that allows you to determine who your visitors will be talking to when they ask for your website and where you&amp;rsquo;ll be adding other records such as &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; records and &amp;lsquo;MX&amp;rsquo; records later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your domain is registered with us, we automatically set the nameservers to ns1.iwantmyname.net, ns2.iwantmyname.net, ns3.iwantmyname.net and ns4.iwantmyname.net for example. This would mean you&amp;rsquo;re able to manage the remainder of your DNS records using our dashboard and still &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&#34;&gt;host your actual website elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. The only catch with DNS is that when you make a change to the name servers it may take a few hours before you can see the changes. This is called DNS propagation and depends on the Internet Service Providers involved between your computer and the hosting company. So if you have made an update to your DNS records and you don&amp;rsquo;t see any effect immediately, all you have to do is wait a few hours until the changes have fully propagated throughout the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;A Record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A record is the record that maps your domain name to a specific IP address on the internet. As an example you would configure an address, like iwantmyname.com to point to an IP address, e.g. 50.56.80.249.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;CNAME Record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a subdomain at another address, say mail.iwantmyname.com exists on another web server, like Gmail, this is where CNAME would be useful. It allows you to direct traffic that reaches that subdomain to a separate address. There are some other uses for this too, Google allows you to use it to verify you own a domain and reset your Gmail administrator password, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;MX Record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one&amp;rsquo;s easy: MX records tell people who try to send you email at your domain where your email service is hosted. The catch with MX records is that you should always set more than one to make sure that if one URL or server at your email host is unavailable you can still receive email. These are set using priority numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you to were use Google Apps for email for example, you would have a first MX record of ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM, with a value/priority of 1. Then, you would have a second record of ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM with a priority of 10. This tells potential email senders&amp;rsquo; servers that they should use the first record of ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM if it&amp;rsquo;s available, but if not, they can still send email to the same system at ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6&#34;&gt;TXT Record&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of records are used for all sorts of things. For verifying domain ownership, combating spam (with SPF) and a few other usages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;rsquo;t used to get to your website at all. For another example that uses Google Apps again, you would verify your domain by potentially placing a TXT value on your DNS of google-site-verification=rXOxyZounnZasA8Z7oaD3c14JdjS9aKSWvsR1EbUSIQ and this proves to Google that you indeed own the domain, since you were able to add the record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many services that you could use with your domain use TXT as a way to verify ownership, but SPF is another case where TXT records are used to help stop spammers from using pretending to be from your domain name. By setting a SPF record (using a DNS TXT entry), it helps other servers verify if mail from your domain is really from you or just being faked. You can read more about that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phew, still with us?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a overview of just some of the types of DNS entry. There are plenty more out there, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA_record#IPv6_in_the_Domain_Name_System&#34;&gt;AAAA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record&#34;&gt;SRV&lt;/a&gt; records, but these are more advanced and you likely won&amp;rsquo;t need to know about these to get started. If you have any questions, sound off in the comments or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;send us an email&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ll try to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname does not register domains you have searched for on our site. EVER.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been flying a bit under the radar for a couple of years but as we grow (iwantmyname is now serving 40,000 customers!) it&amp;rsquo;s only natural that some of the domain industry myths such as front-running are thrown at us. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, front-running is &amp;ldquo;the practice whereby a domain name registrar uses insider information to register domains for the purpose of re-selling them or earning revenue via ads placed on the domain&amp;rsquo;s landing page&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_front_running&#34;&gt;more on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-05-14-frontrunning-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Domain Search Front-Running&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-05-14-frontrunning-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;frontrunning-2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me be absolutely clear. We don&amp;rsquo;t do such things! In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20130826042820/http://inside.godaddy.com/front-running-debunking-myth&#34;&gt;GoDaddy debunked the myths around front-running&lt;/a&gt; based on some search logs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unique as customers believe their domain name ideas are, there&amp;rsquo;s more &amp;ldquo;innovation collision&amp;rdquo; than many people realize. With so many domain name registrations happening every day, there is a good probability a domain name you searched for is also being searched by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even go a step further at iwantmyname and don&amp;rsquo;t participate in any aftermarket practices at all. Questionable activities of other service providers such as parking unused domains or upselling a wheelchair to your grandma to squeeze the last bit of revenue out of customers is the very reason why we started our company a little more than 4 years ago. You can read more the domain management ethics we stand up for on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Promoting Your Creative Portfolio With A Custom Domain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-05-06-22slides.png&#34; alt=&#34;22slides.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname we have a growing following amongst the creative community who love the idea of customising an online portfolio site with their chosen domain name. Once you &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;purchase a domain&lt;/a&gt;, it is a simple step to select the required &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/&#34;&gt;hosted portfolio app&lt;/a&gt; and click to automagically add the correct DNS settings on the domain. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so much easier these days to get a collection of art, photography or design work posted online because of the many high quality hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&#34;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&#34;&gt;online portfolio services&lt;/a&gt; that are available. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration&#34;&gt;22Slides&lt;/a&gt; is a new portfolio app that is getting a lot of attention lately. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://anishbabuverghese.com/&#34;&gt;beautiful example&lt;/a&gt;
of a 22Slides[](&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration&#34;&gt;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration&lt;/a&gt;) site that has been domain customised. The artist uses a
dramatic photographic slideshow to draw in viewers and then subtly markets her
global design consultancy offering with further examples of artwork and
past commercial projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists and designers are attracting greater global interest in their work and securing actual paid contracts by exposing their creativity to a much wider audience. Promoting your art or design work online is a smart move for building reputation and customising your web address with a preferred domain name is the way to go for better visibility. It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to add other services such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting/&#34;&gt;hosted email&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on the same domain. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/&#34;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt; with a portfolio app and new domain name today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Heads Up: Firefox 23 will block non-SSL content on SSL pages</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-04-14-logo-firefox.png&#34; alt=&#34;logo-firefox.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web developers, it&amp;rsquo;s time to check your content! Mozilla &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Site_Compatibility_for_Firefox_23#Non-SSL_contents_on_SSL_pages_are_blocked_by_default&#34;&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Firefox 23, which is due for release into beta on May 17, 2013 is going to feature a change that blocks all content that is non-SSL on an SSL secured page.
Many websites still load elements in an insecure fashion even when their website is SSL secured, so this change is hopefully going to put a swift end to that. There is some disagreement over what developers should be using to solve the problem over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5514344&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;, some argue for using &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/&#34;&gt;protocol-relative URL&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; in linking and others argue that linking should explicitly indicate the protocol.
Regardless of how you fix it, Firefox 23 will exit beta and hit the stable channel on August 6, 2013. It&amp;rsquo;s probably time to start planning for this now, not after it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Founders Humbled By Cambodia Visit</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Manu and Lenz from iwantmyname are just back from a head-spinning ten days in the tropical heat of Cambodia, participating in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gfnchallenge.org/&#34;&gt;Good For Nothing Challenge&lt;/a&gt; (GFN). Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick overview from Lenz about how the visit unfolded and what was achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mission was to support NGO and other social initiatives as the South-East Asian nation grapples with poverty and the need to improve literacy and numeracy amongst its young people. The trip certainly gave us a crash course on the current situation in the country. We learned about the various approaches being taken to
help improve the situation and the work that is done by both large NGOs and grassroots charities, of which there are over 3000. It soon became apparent that all NGOs are not equal and contributors need to be judicious about where they expend their time and resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, the idea behind GFN was to go to a country that faces massive challenges
and work with local NGOs and charities to make a change by applying our knowledge across the various fields of our expertise. During our lunch breaks we enjoyed local
speakers that told us about their experience in the aid sector and shared about their
lives in Cambodia, which really made a big difference in understanding
the environment we worked in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-04-11-gfn-cambodian-school.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cambodian School&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our first day saw us visiting a school next to an old rubbish dump in
one of the poorest slums in Phnom Penh. Grit, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gritlearning.com/what-is-grit.html&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; Manu and I worked on,
maintains a lab there. We gave out Android based tablets for school kids to use
in their time off to teach them maths. This lab gave us a good
way of testing progress, testing various interaction models and, most
important, working with the local teachers to increase the impact we can
have by helping them teach kids in a fun and easy way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grit lab is in a house that has no air conditioning, just one window and a
few fans. When the power goes out, which happens quite regularly, there
is no way at all of cooling down the room, which makes for quite a challenging
environment when the thermometer is nudging 40 degrees. I managed to
observe the kids in there for about an hour and after that my attention
rapidly faded. Picturing myself learning in there every day gave me a
very high incentive to focus my efforts for the remainder of the week. Our biggest challenge with the technology was overheating tablets. The games are not the issue, the CPUs are idling, it is dust and heat that
kills them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Developing an Android-based learning environment for tablets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With this in mind I started coding a working learning environment for
Grit that implemented the interaction designs we came up with after
watching the kids learn on the tablets. Manu worked on a curriculum and
on selecting content for the kids to play with that aligned with what they
were learning in class. Manu also made lots of progress on her Khmer language skills
because a lot of the maths they learn in the early years is in Khmer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because we lacked Khmer content for the tablets we instead worked closely with
the team that developed an Android learning course to foster a local
developer scene. It is hoped that this will give schools a way to teach Android development.
This team worked with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kapekh.org/&#34;&gt;KAPE&lt;/a&gt; and their schools to create a first
learning game in Khmer during the week. They also translated the entire
learning materials into Khmer which was so successful they have now been asked by universities if
they would be able to use the content as well to teach older students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We ended up with a working learning app that runs on Android tablets and
can expose any Android based game that is relevant for the age of the
kids playing. We also implemented quizzes that are in sync with the
curriculum and help us track progress as well as give feedback to the
teachers. Because helping kids is our main objective, we are developing
all the software via open source and everyone who wants to contribute can do
so on github. We plan to organise a few hack sessions in Wellington over
the next months and are looking forward to meeting many of you who want to
help out and hack on something meaningful locally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambodia is an incredibly diverse country. But their are huge inequities in wealth distribution, especially in
the capital Phnom Penh. It also has one of the highest density of
charities worldwide; which is a big issue because just giving money to
someone may only finance a brand new Range Rover &amp;mdash; and there are loads
of them everywhere. Being in Cambodia and doing due diligence who we
give money to and who we help by cutting some code, made me confident our
time here was well spent. It was also incredibly well organised and the
time we needed to hit the ground running was hours not days or weeks.
Working in Cambodia is very challenging but also very rewarding and I am
sure Cambodia will see us again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of the future of GFN, we are already talking about the next
event. No location and time yet but if you are interested in joining us,
please &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; it will be a week well spent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GFN Cambodia was an amazing experience for both of us and permanently
changed the way we think about aid work and about education. We are
stoked that we built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;global tech company&lt;/a&gt; that in turn enables us to make a dent in the
international aid work with very targeted and well researched actions which genuinely target those most in need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Need To Register Domains Requiring A Postal Address In Europe? We&#39;ve Got You Covered!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2013-02-15-europe-flag.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;europe-flag.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 20 years after founding the European Union, one would think that it may also have had a profound impact on the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) of its member states &amp;mdash; but the reality is looking somewhat different. In 2013 there are still quite a few restricted European top-level domains (TLDs) which require a local presence in the respective country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you can buy some of these TLDs without an address in Germany, France, Italy or other countries in Europe. If you purchase one of the following domain extensions at iwantmyname, we can help you out with a local proxy service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france&#34;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;: the French top-level domain requires a physical address in France which is added to all .fr domains purchased at iwantmyname automatically and included in our yearly registration fee. This also applies to the affiliated .re, .pm, .tf, .wf and .yt suffixes of French dependencies or overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;: our trustee service for .DE domains is available at $5/year and will be added to your order if required. It will replace your international address with the mandatory German admin contact address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy&#34;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;: the Italian TLD needs a street address in one of the European member states. Our .it proxy service provides this address for domains ordered through our service at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&#34;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;: all .EU domains must be registered using a residential address in one of its member states. Should you not reside in the European Union, we provide a trustee service at $12/year and apply it to your order automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we are making it dead-easy to register international domains for you. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;Get started with your domain search now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Happy Holidays</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been an amazingly full and challenging year for us here at iwantmyname as we continued to win over new fans with our no-nonsense approach to domain management. Elsewhere, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html&#34;&gt;Hobbits&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html&#34;&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/10/scared-bitless.html&#34;&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;, 2012 has been a rather eventful year globally as well. Now as the holiday season is almost upon us, you can rest easy in the full knowledge that we will still be on deck keeping a watchful eye on your domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year we launched a crisp &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html&#34;&gt;new design for iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; including improvements in search speed and functionality. 2012 was also the year in which we witnessed hundreds of aspiring domain applicants preparing bids for the release of new top level domains. Some of the applications had merit, whilst others were downright &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/more-new-domains-wtf.html&#34;&gt;domain crazy&lt;/a&gt;. We continue to monitor the process and will keep you informed if and when new domain spaces emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got major plans for 2013 ourselves too, including additional development work on our customer dashboard. We&amp;rsquo;re also doing our bit for the economic recovery by taking on more domain elves, plus we are planning a move to bigger and brighter premises as we continue our global growth. None of these things would have been possible without the support of our valued customers however. Apart from your domain business, we especially appreciate all of your &lt;a href=&#34;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general&#34;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;. We want to make registering and managing a domain name easy and fun, so it really helps us to improve when we hear about our customers&amp;rsquo; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Stumped for gift ideas? Avoid shopping mall madness this season and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift&#34;&gt;register a gift domain name&lt;/a&gt; for friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why Your Domain Survived The Sandy Storm</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before co-founding &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, I was employed as an aviation meteorologist, so the events of this week have been both fascinating and frightening as New York and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States endured a full frontal assault from Extra-Tropical Storm Sandy. Forecasts of the danger led to mass evacuations and shut-downs of key infrastructure such as airports, subway and power utilities. But how did Sandy get so damn big and is there a threat to Internet services and data security when disaster strikes in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandy began as a late season hurricane originating near the Bahamas. Although the tropical storm barely made it to category 2 strength as it scooted past Florida, subsequent interaction with mid-latitude upper level systems and cold air from the north increased her ferocity. Energized by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream that flow along the east coast, the region experiences one or two major storms each year. Sandy was one of the largest recorded Atlantic storms by surface area and has similarities to Hurricane Floyd that deluged the north-east with rain in 1999. Hurricane Andrew (1992) and Hurricane Katrina (2005) gained greater infamy for wind strength and the extent of devastation wrought in the south of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With climate change and the forecast increase in severity of storms, how robust is the Internet infrastructure that we rely upon daily? Preparedness and technical redundancy are issues that constantly prey upon the mind of operational teams at any fast growing Internet company and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; is no exception. Consequently, we have our front end servers parked in several geographically remote locations globally. We also secure customer, domain and DNS record data externally with independent partners in Europe that have their own highly robust system architectures. System failure at any single location would never result in an irrecoverable loss of customer data or degradation of the existing DNS service on your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service providers who support key elements of the global Internet infrastructure and domain name system also have multiple layers of redundancy in place. For example ICANN was quick to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.icann.org/2012/10/root-zone-ksk-vs-hurricane-sandy/&#34;&gt;allay fears&lt;/a&gt; regarding handling of DNSSEC management based in its Virginia data center. Most hosted services in the affected area &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudflare.com/what-happens-when-a-hurricane-hits-the-web&#34;&gt;coped well&lt;/a&gt; despite some challenges. But the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/10/amazon-web-services/&#34;&gt;reported outage&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/30/hurricane_sandy_blog_death/&#34;&gt;failures&lt;/a&gt; of some prominent blog sites suggests that the chief threat lies with individual &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;cloud based applications&lt;/a&gt; that may be a little over-reliant on a single server node. But losing access to your Pinterest or Instagram for a couple of hours is hardly a crisis in comparison to the severe trials being faced by residents of the North-East in the wake of the storm. Keep safe!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Short Domain Search Made Easy!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;new iwantmyname search&lt;/a&gt; is the ability to check domain availability for ultra-short domains. If you enter a 2-letter domain, we will automatically display only search results for top-level domains (TLDs) allowing registration of these little gems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-08-17-short-domain-search.png&#34; alt=&#34;Short Domain Search&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&#34;&gt;list of country code TLDs supporting domains consisting of two characters&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/af-afghan-domain-name-registration-for-afghanistan&#34;&gt;.AF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ag-domain-name-registration-for-antigua-and-barbuda&#34;&gt;.AG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cx-domain-name-registration-for-christmas-island&#34;&gt;.CX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&#34;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gd-grenadian-domain-name-registration-for-grenada&#34;&gt;.GD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland&#34;&gt;.GL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gs-domain-name-registration-for-south-georgia-and-the-south-sandwich-islands&#34;&gt;.GS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gy-guyanese-domain-name-registration-for-guyana&#34;&gt;.GY&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ht-haitian-domain-name-registration-for-haiti&#34;&gt;.HT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&#34;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat&#34;&gt;.MS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mu-mauritian-domain-name-registration-for-mauritius&#34;&gt;.MU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pe-peruvian-domain-name-registration-for-peru&#34;&gt;.PE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste&#34;&gt;.TL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/vg-domain-name-registration-for-british-virgin-islands&#34;&gt;.VG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short domains are a rare commodity, for example there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/05/100-shockingly-short-io-domain-names-available-today.html&#34;&gt;less than 100 letter-only 2-char .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; left! Grab a tiny web address for your &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/&#34;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/&#34;&gt;URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;start your short domain search now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&#34;&gt;New .IO domains&lt;/a&gt; are currently on sale @ 69.00 USD!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname Scores International Gold In Domains Finale</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-07-31-gold.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gold.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the sporting world might be on the medal count at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.london2012.com/&#34;&gt;London 2012 Olympics&lt;/a&gt; right now, but our customers are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;telling us&lt;/a&gt; that we&amp;rsquo;ve already won a gold medal with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html&#34;&gt;new design&lt;/a&gt;. We love getting that kind of feedback. In the meantime&amp;hellip;are your favorite athletes winning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. womens&amp;rsquo; soccer team has been keeping gold medal hopes alive this week as well as keeping the sports gossip columnists abuzz, in the lead up to the U.S. vs North Korea grudge match. Controversial goal keeper &lt;a href=&#34;http://archived.link/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/us-olympic-goalkeeper-solo-doesnt-back-down-from-tweets-critical-of-nbc-analyst-chastain/2012/07/30/gJQAgYNkKX_story.html&#34;&gt;Hope Solo&lt;/a&gt; found herself in hot water after tweeting some rather harsh criticism of a media commentator. It was a timely reminder of how we need to manage our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/&#34;&gt;online profile&lt;/a&gt; carefully in an age of near instantaneous reportage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, U.K. sports fans (and royal watchers) have been charting hopefully the progress of Zara Phillips who has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18906141&#34;&gt;performing strongly&lt;/a&gt; in the equestrian events. There were also big smiles all round as the the British mens gymnasts earned an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/gymnastics/9439776/London-2012-Olympics-Team-GB-gymnasts-on-a-roll.html&#34;&gt;unexpected bronze&lt;/a&gt;, the first Olympic medal in that sport for the U.K. in over a century. Fanatic about Olympic sports?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=zaraphillips&amp;amp;hideUnavailable=false&#34;&gt;search for a domain&lt;/a&gt; based on your favorite athlete and go global with an informative domain customized sports &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Wonderful Wellington Startup Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-07-27-sw65.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sw65.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t believe another Startup Weekend has rolled around already! The global new venture development initiative has been taking New Zealand by storm as word has spread amongst developers, designers and young entrepreneurs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellington.startupweekend.org/&#34;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; is being held in our home town of Wellington this time, which means the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about&#34;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; will be right in the thick of it once again this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with Startup Weekend in New Zealand since the very first event through sponsorships, domain name giveaways as well as assisting with event management and mentoring at various times. At this event we are also co-sponsoring a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/booting-startup-weekends-mix-mashup.html&#34;&gt;special prize&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with Mix &amp;amp; Mash and the Digital Earth Summit, aimed specifically at teams leveraging open data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out for the big new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; banner at Startup Weekends throughout New Zealand to claim a free &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&#34;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; for your team. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, we also make it one-click easy to set up a wide range of handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&#34;&gt;developer services&lt;/a&gt; and apps on your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend is bringing 54 hours of start-up goodness to a town near you very soon. The Wellington event is full, but we are also &lt;a href=&#34;http://palmynorth.startupweekend.org/2012/07/13/iwantmyname-partners-with-startup-weekend-palmerston-north/&#34;&gt;supporting Palmerston North Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt; which kicks off on 24th August.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Brand New iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce the launch of our site redesign and new iwantmyname logo. As mentioned last week this refresh is a first step towards a new control panel which will speed up the interaction with your domains dramatically. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to share it with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-07-25-iwmn.png&#34; alt=&#34;iwmn.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new logo designed by New Zealand based designer &lt;a href=&#34;http://jarredbishop.info/&#34;&gt;Jarred Bishop&lt;/a&gt; who you also might know as the developer of several &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/04/3-awesome-simple-tumblr-themes-designed-by-jarred-bishop.html&#34;&gt;awesome Tumblr themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/search&#34;&gt;Faster domain search&lt;/a&gt; with all &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&#34;&gt;100+ domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; on one single page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The layout has been moved to Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap framework&lt;/a&gt;, customized to our needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small improvements to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt; and iwantmyname dashboard, mainly a new internal navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank &lt;a href=&#34;http://bitbybit.io&#34;&gt;Wellington developers bit by bit&lt;/a&gt; who have been working with us on the new site. And now what are you waiting for? Check out the new site and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Warm Welcome For Web Developers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are a major sponsor of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wdcnz.com/&#34;&gt;WDCNZ&lt;/a&gt; this year and (fortuitously) it coincides with the launch of our wonderful site redesign. Therefore, we thought it highly appropriate to celebrate this stupendous occasion by organising a pre-event &lt;a href=&#34;http://up.org.nz/events/wdcnz_welcome_drinks&#34;&gt;social function&lt;/a&gt; for Web Dev Con delegates at &lt;strong&gt;5.00pm on Wednesday 1st August at Tap Haus, Cnr Victoria &amp;amp; Dixon Streets, Wellington&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We especially want to welcome visitors from outside the region and also say a big thank-you to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/&#34;&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt; community who have been amongst our biggest supporters (and critics). The site migration has taken place and we&amp;rsquo;d love to get &lt;a href=&#34;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general&#34;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;new design&lt;/a&gt; from all of you. As we &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html&#34;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; recently, we are only as good as the people around us and we are driven to provide the most friendly and easy to use service for global &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;domain registration&lt;/a&gt; and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a web developer visiting Wellington for WDCNZ, locally based dev or simply a recent customer of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;, then we&amp;rsquo;d love to see you. We&amp;rsquo;re getting some delicious (and rare) Parrot Dog ales sorted, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need a secret code word to score a nice cold pint of local craft beer on us. Make sure you &lt;a href=&#34;http://up.org.nz/events/wdcnz_welcome_drinks&#34;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; through Unlimited Potential, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&#34;&gt;drop us an email&lt;/a&gt; or simply DM us on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iwantmynameNZ&#34;&gt;NZ Twitter&lt;/a&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iwantmyname Site Migration Next Week</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the week starting July 23, we&amp;rsquo;re making some updates to our service. The changes will take about 24 hours and not involve any downtime of your domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s changing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new logo, site design and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/new-faster-domain-search.html&#34;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt; which is much faster and allows filtering of search results. There will also be small tweaks to our dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of the new home page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-07-17-new-website-small.png&#34; alt=&#34;New iwantmyname Home Page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will I be affected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your domains will not be affected by the change. However, you might not be able to log in to our dashboard temporarily, purchase new domains or start a domain transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to make any changes to your domains (e.g. update DNS records) we recommend doing them before the migration begins on Monday, Jul 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s coming next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue our mission to make domain management a painless experience. The new design is a first step towards an improved dashboard which is currently under development. So stay tuned for more updates in the coming months!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Beware Of Domain Name Renewal Scams</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Different &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_scams&#34;&gt;types of domain name scams&lt;/a&gt; have been around for many years, yet many domain owners are still unaware of the issue. The scams range from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marco.org/2010/09/23/the-asian-domain-name-extortion-scam&#34;&gt;threatening to register available versions of your name or brand&lt;/a&gt; to phishing emails to get your username and password. One of the most common scams is the attempt of tricking customers into transferring domains to another registrar who charges an exorbitant amount for domain renewals. Quite often these attempts are made by post to make it look more legit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example letter &amp;ldquo;Domain Renewal Group&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-06-26-domain-renewal-scam-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Domain Renewal Scam Letter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to check when you receive an email or letter regarding your domain registration, renewal or transfer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember you will never receive a written letter from us to register, renew or transfer a domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the sender address of renewal (or other) notification emails. All our notifications and reminders are sent from an email address ending in &amp;lsquo;@iwantmyname.com&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;@support.iwantmyname.com&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always make sure you are on iwantmyname.com in your browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar before entering any login information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve come acress many domain name scams over the years as you can imagine. If in doubt, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;please contact us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>More New Domains .WTF?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;ICANN&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/new-top-level-domain-list.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;big reveal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; exposed the plans of numerous registry aspirants who plan to have a tilt at creating their own new top level domains (TLDs). Now the Internet&amp;rsquo;s governing authority has to wade through almost two thousand individual applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions of an eighteen month turnaround time for applicants are looking rather optimistic at this point. But whilst the domain gnomes at ICANN are pondering these multitudinous possibilities, sit down and grab yourself a .BEER. Here&amp;rsquo;s a glimpse at some of the more amusing TLDs that might just be winging their way into our browser address bars in the near future &lt;strong&gt;.JUSTFORU&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-06-18-regretful-transformer-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;regretful-transformer-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital domains for tech geeks are .COOL this year. If you are a .DEV .NINJA, we&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered. You can host your &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/app-domain-names-will-create-new-naming-opportunities-for-developers.html&#34;&gt;.APP&lt;/a&gt; in the .CLOUD, after all it&amp;rsquo;s the safest place to be when the .TRANSFORMERS invade from outer .SPACE . Blue pill or red one? We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to enter the .MATRIX to do battle with the dreaded .BOT. After a trippy experience like that, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised someone didn&amp;rsquo;t nominate .POT. But that may be going a little too far&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it remains to be seen whether any of these proposed TLDs actually make the final cut. Some will likely .FAIL, but it&amp;rsquo;s been fun imagining .LOL :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cargo Website Showcases Retro Revival</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-06-12-revival.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;revival.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the brightly coloured, tartan woolen blankets that your parents used to set up summer picnics on down at the beach? Those iconic blankies are now enjoying a second life as upholstering on recycled furniture. Brilliant idea, or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Cottrell, a lover of both classic furniture and wool, moved to New Zealand almost thirty years ago to start a family. As a sheep farmer&amp;rsquo;s wife, living in the rugged hills above Taihape, she soon gained a powerful respect for the warmth and hardiness of woolen clothing and furnishings. From that respect sprang a cottage industry involving recovering and re-upholstering furniture using the very same woolen blankets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our website of the month &lt;a href=&#34;http://revivalfurniture.co.nz/&#34;&gt;Revival Furnishings&lt;/a&gt; promotes a steady stream of recycled furniture in a vast array of shapes, sizes and patterns. The company built and hosted their attractive online brochure using &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain&#34;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt; a wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/&#34;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt; application that is getting huge traction worldwide. Apart from being a brilliant Kiwi example of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains&#34;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; branded home-made website, we love the way the company recycles classic furniture and makes it look uber-chic again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up your personal domain on a wide range of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services&#34;&gt;hosted apps and services&lt;/a&gt; with our easy one click DNS manager. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&#34;&gt;Transfer&lt;/a&gt; your .NZ domain to iwantmyname for free or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for a new international domain today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Eyebrows Raised As CISPA Rolls Forward</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Internet commentators were in a flap today and &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3896492&#34;&gt;tech forums&lt;/a&gt; abuzz as it was revealed the U.S. House of Representatives &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57422567-281/house-approves-cispa-despite-last-minute-push-by-opponents/&#34;&gt;voted in favor of the CISPA Act&lt;/a&gt;. Seems like there is no let up in the barrage of legislation designed to afford greater &amp;ldquo;protection&amp;rdquo; for individuals and corporations that use or abuse the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;yber &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ntelligence &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;haring and &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rotection &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ct ostensibly facilitates the voluntary sharing of information between U.S.
government agencies and private companies
to defend against external attacks on networks. It amends some tired laws that date back over sixty years in some cases. Whilst most people agree that the cyber threats mentioned in the bill do exist, there is disagreement over whether such legislation would be effective at all. Critics of the bill also worry that it legalizes information sharing that could impact on privacy, under the guise of ensuring security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama is reportedly unimpressed by the current version of CISPA as well and alluded to the possibility of a Presidential Veto despite the fact some of the most intrusive aspects of the bill were toned down considerably before it was approved. A few original supporters of the bill were left in a quandry as they struggled to balance &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/cispa-national-security-and-nsa-ability-read-your-emails&#34;&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; against the very real need to mitigate against cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far the bill actually proceeds is still uncertain; but after last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/01/sopa-blackout.html&#34;&gt;SOPA debacle&lt;/a&gt; it once again raises the spectre of a hurriedly written law that has huge implications for corporations and individuals and about which most citizens have had little or no prior information. But with the Presidential election looming and other competing bills on the Senate agenda it may be a long time before CISPA sees the light of day. In the meantime voters have the opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paidcontent.org/2012/04/26/faq-what-you-need-to-know-about-fridays-cispa-vote/&#34;&gt;get informed&lt;/a&gt; about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Care For Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Updates?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days we had some requests for a simple API that allows DNS updates for your &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains&#34;&gt;domains&lt;/a&gt; from the console or from within a script. We really wanted this for a long time too so I sat down and looked around for standards already in use. The de-facto standard for these sorts of updates seems to be DDNS &amp;mdash; used widely by DynDNS &amp;mdash; which is supported by many routers out of the box. We sat down and wrote a DDNS implementation for iwantmyname and you can use it right away. No configuration needed, no special stuff to set up, just start using it. The call looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -u &amp;quot;[username]:[password]&amp;quot; \
  &amp;quot;https://iwantmyname.com/basicauth/ddns?hostname=[hostname1]&amp;amp;myip=[IP]&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be more than one hostname in the update call (separated by commas) and hostnames that don&amp;rsquo;t exist yet will be created implicitly. Please keep in mind that DNS will be cached. In order to find out what records are currently set for your domain, just ask our nameservers directly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dig @ns1.iwantmyname.net [hostname]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will return the current DNS settings for the hostname that our authoritative nameservers have. If you want to check the IP addresses various resolvers around the world know of, try the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whatsmydns.net/&#34;&gt;DNS check tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[UPDATE]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to feedback from our users we made our DDNS service even more useful. The &amp;ldquo;myip&amp;rdquo; parameter is now optional and gets automagically filled with the remote IP if not provided. This makes it even easier if you use this with a dynamic address as you can skip the step where you try to figure out your own address.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How A Personal Website Can Boost Your Business</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest post by Per Schmitz &amp;mdash; Founder of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dooid.com&#34;&gt;DooID&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2012-02-23-logo-profile-dooid.png&#34; alt=&#34;DooID&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://dooid.com&#34;&gt;DooID&lt;/a&gt; we focus on developing an outstanding platform for simple and clean personal websites. Our aim is to help you build an effective tool that will enhance your accessibility and promote your personal brand, in a painless, easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personal website will help you to connect with clients on a very emotional level, as you don&amp;rsquo;t only display the professional aspects of your life, but also give insights into who you are, your interests and visions. This emotional link will help to build trust and a deeper personal relationship with your audience. Emotions are a very subjective component of every sales process, but none the less weight heavily when taking decisions. At the same time your personal website displays all your on- and offline contact data. Unlike on a paper business card, virtually displayed contact data can easily be kept up-to-date and can showcase everything from your social media links to phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point people to one simple place where they can find your complete range of communication options, and can easily choose which way is the most comfortable for them to contact you. DooID allows to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/dooid-on-your-domain&#34;&gt;use your own domain name&lt;/a&gt; with the created personal website, which is a big advantage and adds professionalism when using your site for business purposes. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/08/5-domain-extensions-for-your-personal-website.html&#34;&gt;personal domain name&lt;/a&gt; like &amp;ldquo;yourname.me&amp;rdquo; will make your site easier to remember and look more professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just teamed up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://dooid.com&#34;&gt;DooID&lt;/a&gt; to help you &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/dooid-on-your-domain&#34;&gt;set up your new domain and add it to your DooID site&lt;/a&gt; with one click &amp;mdash; without any technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Year For The People</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-12-31-demo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;demo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a remarkable year in many respects with a continuing catalogue of financial, political and environmental upheavals that affected both New Zealand and many other nations across the planet. However, it has been both inspiring and satisfying to witness the extent to which the Internet played a significant role in the human responses to such challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as Kiwis were sitting down for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/a-christmas-mission.html&#34;&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; dinner a wave of consumer activism was spreading around the world in response to the proposed SOPA bill in the United States which proposes far reaching reforms in an effort to counter intellectual property piracy. The much criticised bill seeks to protect digital rights for artists, but ironically imposes a burden on all Internet companies that enable the creation, sharing and hosting of online content. That&amp;rsquo;s a situation which New Zealanders already have some familiarity with when we think about the impact of the so-called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://archived.link/http://3strikes.net.nz/&#34;&gt;Three Strikes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; legislation enacted here this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global Internet community was stunned to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/godaddys_sopa_support_sparks_calls_for_boycotts_an.php&#34;&gt;learn the names&lt;/a&gt; of some of the large technology corporations that were backing the bill, including the world&amp;rsquo;s largest domain registrar, and a rallying cry went out to support a consumer boycott. For many it was the last straw as dissatisfaction with that company had been growing for some time. Consequently we&amp;rsquo;ve set up a service to make &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&#34;&gt;domain transfers&lt;/a&gt; easy over the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some commentators questioning whether or not a protest would be meaningful, the boycott appears to have made some major tech businesses sit up and take notice. With Sony, EA and Nintendo &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-largest-game-companies-in-the-world-have-dropped-their-support-for-a-bill-the-internet-hates-2011-12&#34;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; back-peddling on supporting SOPA in its current form it seems like the business world has been forced to think more seriously about the wider implications in terms of how the bill affects Internet freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there were far more dramatic cases of Internet activism in 2011, with corrupt regimes dropping like dead flies as social media fueled protest drew thousands of disaffected citizens onto the streets. 2012 will no doubt continue to illustrate why we need a free and open Internet unfettered by governments and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year and Best Wishes for 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Helping Hand For Domain Transfers</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-12-29-robot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Domain Robot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/make-a-move-for-good.html&#34;&gt;join the movement&lt;/a&gt; against your old fashioned, SOPA-loving (or not loving, or maybe loving), redneck domain registrar &amp;mdash; but are not quite sure how to transfer your precious domains. Never fear, we&amp;rsquo;ve created a special &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&#34;&gt;automatic domain transfer service&lt;/a&gt; just for you. iwantmyname aims to make domain management painless, simply &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&#34;&gt;fill out the form&lt;/a&gt; and let us deal with all the messy details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately transferring a domain from one registrar to another is not always a straightforward exercise. However, our team of industry veterans are expert in untangling red tape and solving life&amp;rsquo;s little administrative problems. Provided you are willing to supply us with access to your existing account, we can handle everything for you. That leaves you more time to spend enjoying your holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do for you? First we will send you a quote for the cost of transfer (you get a 12 month extension with each transfer). Once you agree to the quote, we contact your existing registrar and gain all the required codes and permissions to make the transfer of your domains. Of course we will also migrate any DNS settings, so you get a completely seamless changeover. We&amp;rsquo;ve included a detailed FAQ on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&#34;&gt;domain transfer page&lt;/a&gt; in case you have any questions or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, at iwantmyname we will never try to up-sell you with stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t need, plus we make domain and DNS management a breeze with our clean dashboard and simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;one-click DNS set-up&lt;/a&gt; on your favourite hosted apps. Want to find out more? Here are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt; from our many happy customers. Welcome to the movement!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Make A Move For Good</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re starting a movement and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
Recently you may have become aware of a list of corporations that are supporting the so called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act&#34;&gt;SOPA legislation&lt;/a&gt;. SOPA proposes much stronger responses for countering illicit trade in intellectual property, including far reaching measures that could impact a wide range of online service providers and indeed disrupt the safety and trust within the entire domain name system. We&amp;rsquo;ve been following the debate around SOPA from here in New Zealand, because it also potentially impacts on global Internet companies like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists, developers and other creatives certainly have a right to be fairly remunerated for their work. But the SOPA legislation, in its current form, has huge negative implications for digital innovation and personal freedoms globally. The Internet evolved largely on the basis of trust and openness and we get nervous when governments and corporations make up more rules that threaten those freedoms. If 2011 taught us nothing else, it was that the Internet has become the global vanguard of social democracy and a force for good. Let&amp;rsquo;s not give up those rights without a struggle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of good people are voting with their feet now and saying hey we don&amp;rsquo;t want to support big companies that are against Internet freedom. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that any company would undermine the very industry that it purports to enable &amp;ndash; but it seems to be the case. So if you have strong views on this topic and you are thinking of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&#34;&gt;transferring your domain&lt;/a&gt; portfolio to a company that respects Internet freedom and opposes censorship, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: In case you need a hand making a domain transfer, we&amp;rsquo;ve set up a free &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice&#34;&gt;domain concierge&lt;/a&gt; service to alleviate any hassles.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New, Faster Domain Search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to release a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/nsearch&#34;&gt;new version of the iwantmyname domain search&lt;/a&gt; today. During 2011 we&amp;rsquo;ve been paying a lot of attention to all the great feedback we&amp;rsquo;ve been getting from you about our service. Over the last few weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve worked really hard to implement some new ideas on the site that we think you&amp;rsquo;ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost 100 different domain extensions on offer, the main focus has been on improving speed and more efficiently displaying the search results on a single page. We&amp;rsquo;ve also added several different optional display filters such as categories and domain availability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/search&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-12-13-blog-new-domain-search.png&#34; alt=&#34;blog-new-domain-search.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now also easier to search for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&#34;&gt;two-letter domain names&lt;/a&gt; as we will only show TLDs supporting these little goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/nsearch&#34;&gt;new search&lt;/a&gt; currently runs in public beta mode, so please let us know if you run into any issues &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;via our support center&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Domain Name Year 2011 In Review</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With the end of the year rapidly approaching, it&amp;rsquo;s timely to now look back on the events that defined the domain name industry in 2011. What a year it has been, notably with the approval of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). The long anticipated new domains will bring a flood of choices for naming your home on the web and an increasing need for next generation domain management tools and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are our domain industry highlights for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. New Generic Top-Level Domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet regulatory body &lt;a href=&#34;http://icann.org&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, concluded a lengthy history of internal debate and negotiation with multiple stakeholders that began with its formation in 1998. The organization unleashed approval to allow anybody to apply for a top-level domain. The historic move opens the doors to specifically branded domains, such as .ibm or .bmw, as well as new domains aimed at more general verticals, such as .hotel or .sport. There are also moves afoot to create domain brands for geographic regions, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://dotberlin.org/&#34;&gt;.berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://dotnyc.net/&#34;&gt;.nyc&lt;/a&gt;. The application window begins January 2012, but industry observers predict that it may be 2013 before the first new domains roll off the production line. It is anticipated that the new offerings will encompass internationalised domain name (IDN) facilities, incorporating non-Latin scripts from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTvmhk1Fqns&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Rising Popularity of Internationalized Country Domain Extensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011 saw a marked rise in the adoption of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) across the globe; a trend likely to be accelerated as new top level domains begin to emerge. Registries from countries embracing a diversity of ethnicity and languages have been quick to become involved, with a total of 29 country code domains having been evaluated by ICANN. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idnnews.com/?p=9947&#34;&gt;Malaysia has been the most recently added&lt;/a&gt;, enabling fuller representation of Internet names across a nation of four different official languages and numerous regional dialects. Russia operates one of the most successful domains achieving over 800,000 registrations of Cyrillic domains on the transliterated .ru country code. More recently the Russians achieved dual listing status with the launch of the top level national domain .PФ (Российская Федерация).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bytelevel.com/map/IDN.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-12-08-idn-map-final.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;idn-map-final.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bytelevel.com/map/IDN.html&#34;&gt;IDN map from Byte Level Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. .COM Reaching 100 Million Registered Names (almost)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we there yet? The familiar and reliable &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.COM domain&lt;/a&gt; has been around 26 years and is by far the most popular domain with nearly half of all global registrations. Whilst Planet Earth clocked up its 7 billionth citizen in 2011, .COM is expected to attain &lt;a href=&#34;http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/10/19/huge-internet-milestone-100-million-com-domain-names/&#34;&gt;100 million unique domains&lt;/a&gt; around about the end of the year (give or take a week). It is almost unbelievable to think that this plucky little generic top level domain (gTLD) had less than 10,000 registrants back in 1995, but has now become the standard for almost every &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/&#34;&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&#34;&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/&#34;&gt;home user&lt;/a&gt; on the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.registrarstats.com/TLDDomainCounts.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-12-08-dotcom-domain-stats-final.png&#34; alt=&#34;dotcom-domain-stats-final.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Domain Name Sales Still Going Strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domainers, traders and domain real estate investors had a buoyant 2011, despite perturbations in the global economy. It seems some domains appreciate in value (a lot!). But the trick of course is to figure out which ones. In a year which saw both a Facebook movie and a staggering IPO by business network LinkedIn, it came as no surprise to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dnjournal.com/archive/lowdown/2011/dailyposts/20110621.htm&#34;&gt;social.com change hands for a cool $2.6 million&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of new gTLDs will no doubt stimulate and expand the market for highly sought after domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What were your highlights for 2011? We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Dashboard Updates: Improved Heroku DNS Setup, Notes &amp; Marketplace Search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving our dashboard in response to great feedback you have given us during &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellington.startupweekend.org&#34;&gt;Startup Weekend Wellington&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ability to add notes for a domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now add free-form notes to any of your domains with additional information. Fill in whatever you want, e.g your girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s birthday (you can never have enough reminders), links to external services (you can use basic HTML) or hosting-related information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-11-12-domain-notes.png&#34; alt=&#34;Add Notes To Your Domain&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Marketplace App search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With almost 100 entries in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;iwantmyname marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, it has become increasingly more difficult to find the app or service you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. The new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps&#34;&gt;marketplace search&lt;/a&gt; will help you to set up domains even faster from your dashboard now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-11-12-search.png&#34; alt=&#34;iwantmyname Marketplace Search&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Choose your Heroku application stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain&#34;&gt;setting up custom domains for Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s now a drop-down menu that let&amp;rsquo;s you choose whether you&amp;rsquo;re using the Cedar or Aspen / Bamboo stack. This will add the necessary CNAME and A record DNS settings for your app on Heroku automatically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-11-12-heroku.png&#34; alt=&#34;Heroku DNS Setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to come in November, you should especially keep an eye on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=ThisSearchWillBeAwesomeSoon&#34;&gt;domain search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Introducing Free Whois Address Masking To Protect Your Privacy</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Domain privacy has been a long-awaited feature at iwantmyname and we&amp;rsquo;re happy to now give you an option to mask your home address in the public whois record without giving up ownership or transfer control. The service is free of charge and can be easily added to your domains from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/domains&#34;&gt;iwantmyname dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, domain registrations require your contact information to be provided for storage and display in the international whois database. This means that anyone in the world can view your address and phone number without restriction.
We appreciate that some of you may not want this due to obvious privacy reasons such as identity theft, fraud or stalking. By using our free whois protection, individuals can hide their address details (street, city and phone number) from unwanted eyes for the following domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gTLDs (generic top-level domains)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&#34;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&#34;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&#34;&gt;.BIZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&#34;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mobi-domain-name-registration-for-mobile&#34;&gt;.MOBI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&#34;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccTLDs (country code top-level domains)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands&#34;&gt;.CC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos&#34;&gt;.LA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu&#34;&gt;.TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia&#34;&gt;.FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ag-domain-name-registration-for-antigua-and-barbuda&#34;&gt;.AG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize&#34;&gt;.BZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lc-saint-lucian-domain-name-registration-for-saint-lucia&#34;&gt;.LC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mn-mongolian-domain-name-registration-for-mongolia&#34;&gt;.MN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/sc-seychellois-domain-name-registration-for-seychelles&#34;&gt;.SC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/vc-domain-name-registration-for-saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines&#34;&gt;.VC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&#34;&gt;.CO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/so-somali-domain-name-registration-for-somalia&#34;&gt;.SO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enabling whois masking for one of your domains, you will still be the legal owner (registrant) and have access to all email addresses should you want to move to a different registrar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-10-26-whois-masking.png&#34; alt=&#34;Unprotected whois vs. protected whois entry&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SEO Advantages Of Your Own Video Site</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest post by Ray Pawulich, VidCaster.com:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At VidCaster, we give our users the tools to &lt;a href=&#34;http://vidcaster.com&#34;&gt;build their own video site&lt;/a&gt;. We focus on making this process as easy and painless as possible, but also loaded with advanced features that help you maximize your ROI from online video publishing. One of these features is video SEO that &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Key to Video SEO: The Video Sitemap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, video SEO is a subcategory of SEO (search engine optimization) focused on video. Unlike text-based content, video content is not inherently indexable by search engine crawlers. Just uploading a video file to your web-server is not enough for today&amp;rsquo;s search engines to index that content as a video &amp;mdash; if you want your content to come up when a user does a video search, you need to provide search engines with something called a &amp;ldquo;video sitemap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the advent of tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://vidcaster.com&#34;&gt;VidCaster&lt;/a&gt;, creating a video sitemap was a complicated, manual process. To make matters worse, search engines are constantly changing their desired format for a video sitemap, forcing you to stay on top of those changes and update your video sitemap yourself &amp;mdash; not a great proposition if your goal is to focus on creating &amp;amp; promoting your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of this way of doing things is that the vast majority of videos search results are driving traffic to video sharing sites like Vimeo and YouTube &amp;mdash; not the sites of the creators of that content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, VidCaster has revolutionized the creation of the video sitemap by making it automatic and invisible to the user, allowing video publishers to drive traffic to their own site without any additional effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video SEO at Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at an example of how &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hackersandfounders.com/&#34;&gt;Hackers and Founders&lt;/a&gt;, a current VidCaster client, is leveraging video SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because their video site is set up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hackersandfounders.tv/&#34;&gt;hackersandfounders.tv&lt;/a&gt; (which means their brand name is right there in the URL), if we &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=hackers+and+founders&#34;&gt;search for &amp;ldquo;Hackers and Founders&amp;rdquo; in Google&lt;/a&gt;, right on the first page of results we see a video coming from their site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-10-08-vidcaster-blog_post_3.rtfd.png&#34; alt=&#34;Search Result&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this the only video result shown on the page, but as an individual searching that brand name, I instantly know from the URL that this is official content coming directly from that brand &amp;mdash; not user-generated content on a video-sharing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we click through, we are taken to a landing page on that site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-10-08-hackersfounders.png&#34; alt=&#34;hackersfounders.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all the related videos are videos from Hackers &amp;amp; Founders &amp;mdash; there is no way that the viewer can get lost to someone else&amp;rsquo;s video. Try doing that on a video-sharing site!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By presenting the video in an environment over which they have full control, Hackers and Founders gives themselves the opportunity to use their video content to further a business goal &amp;mdash; which, in this case, is to drive traffic toward their sponsor, Microsoft BizSpark. As you can see, they&amp;rsquo;re doing though VidCaster&amp;rsquo;s in-player call-to-action capabilities as well as with a traditional banner ad on the site (something that&amp;rsquo;s also not possible on traditional video-sharing sites).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advanced video SEO: leveraging the video site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For SEO experts, the concept of their own &amp;ldquo;video site&amp;rdquo; opens up many possibilities for boosting the organic ranking of not only their video site, but their main site as well. This is because, whether you have your video site set up on its own domain (such as &lt;strong&gt;hackersandfounders.tv&lt;/strong&gt;) or as a subdomain (such as &lt;strong&gt;tv.airbnb.com&lt;/strong&gt;), search engines will consider your video site wholly separate from your main site &amp;mdash; even though you control both! This allows to strategically use cross-linking between the two in order to share the &amp;ldquo;SEO juice&amp;rdquo; one site might get to rank the other site higher for particular search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Now even easier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video SEO is a new and interesting space and VidCaster is proud to apply our &amp;ldquo;it just works&amp;rdquo; philosophy to this category. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re also proud to announce a new partnership with iwantmyname &amp;mdash; now if you use iwantmyname for domain name management, our service can be easily &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/video/vidcaster-custom-domain&#34;&gt;added to your domains with just one single click&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Startup Weekend Science</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-08-30-swmega.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;swmega.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test tube experiment. Assemble 300 keen young entrepreneurs in the same town as a world famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.demo.com/&#34;&gt;tech conference&lt;/a&gt;, invite one of Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s leading identities to speak and stir vigorously. Sounds like a recipe for success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mega.startupweekend.org/&#34;&gt;Startup Weekend Mega&lt;/a&gt; will be the biggest (and coolest) Startup Weekend ever, so we are thrilled to be supporting the event. iwantmyname has been selected as the official supplier of domain names to all of the teams that go forward from the pitching session. That means we will be online throughout the event supporting our offer of a free year&amp;rsquo;s domain name registration of a .COM, .NET, .ORG or .ME domain to each team. We will also offer some discounts on the less common species of domains. But you have to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://mega.startupweekend.org/tickets/&#34;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; at SW Mega, to take advantage of this offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;iwantmyname team&lt;/a&gt; know all about the challenges of building and growing a new tech venture. So we offer a whole bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/14-new-hosting-services-applications-for-your-domains.html&#34;&gt;hosted services&lt;/a&gt; in our app marketplace specifically aimed at assisting developers getting new ventures up and running; including easy &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;one-click DNS set-up on your domain&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you already have a registrar, you can still use our nifty &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/introducing-dns-hosting-for-external-domains.html&#34;&gt;DNS management&lt;/a&gt; service across your domain portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend is a global phenomenon that invites entrepreneurial developers, designers and business heads to form teams, build a product and launch it in the space of a weekend. SW Mega is focusing this time on health, education and gaming &amp;ndash; with the category winners earning an amazing opportunity to pitch at DEMO conference later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to use DuckDuckGo&#39;s !bang commands to manage your domain names</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary goals at iwantmyname is getting out of the way of our customers when it comes to purchasing and managing domain names. We&amp;rsquo;re also big fans of &lt;a href=&#34;http://duckduckgo.com&#34;&gt;search engine DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; which inspired us to add some special sauce to our domain search, called !bang commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these !bang commands, you can easily add DNS records or other services such as Amazon S3, Github Pages or Tumblr to your domains directly &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;from the search box on iwantmyname homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following !bang commands are currently supported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!edit domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; brings you to the domain status page where you can edit all settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!dns domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; forwards you to our DNS manager for adding new records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!nameserver domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; allows you to update the nameservers for a domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!transfer domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; immediately starts a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&#34;&gt;domain transfer to iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!hostdns domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; creates a zone on our nameservers to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/dns&#34;&gt;host any external domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!updatewhois domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; change the whois data for a particular name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!gapps domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; easily set up Google Apps for your domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!s3 domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; lets you add Amazon S3 to your domain or subdomain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!github domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; adds Github Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;!tumblr domain.com&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; adds Tumblr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip: DuckDuckGo !bang command chaining&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo users can also use !bang command chaining, for example try entering &amp;ldquo;!iwant !nsupdate domain.com&amp;rdquo; in the DuckDuckGo search field and you will end up at the nameserver update page in your iwantmyname dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Google Partners With Motorola</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-08-18-gplusm.png&#34; alt=&#34;gplusm.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHiPs&#34;&gt;C.H.iPs&lt;/a&gt;, the popular 1970s cop show? Lead characters Jon and Ponch had Motorola radios prominently displayed on their police motorbikes. Now Motorola makes a different kind of chip and has just sold it&amp;rsquo;s mobile division to cash rich Google in a US $12.5 billion mega deal that pulls no punches about where the online behemoth is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial deal has raised eyebrows amongst some analysts who fear that Google will alienate other hardware manufacturers just as sales growth of its Android based platforms has taken off. On the other hand, the deal allows Google to have far greater control over its mobile product supply chain; meaning it can compete with Apple more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry critics have been focusing on the mobile story and the opportunity for Google to gobble up swags of proprietary patents with the acquisition; but there is another story that has been somewhat overlooked. Motorola Mobility also manufactures set-top boxes and IPTV equipment, a whole new area that Google has yet turn its full attention towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an unrelated move, Google also recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/gco-official-url-shortcut-for-google.html&#34;&gt;acquired the G.co domain&lt;/a&gt; for use as a url shortener. This will allow it to offer more secure short links to its branded sites as social content sharing continues to grow. The domain purchase is a big win for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia&#34;&gt;.CO domain&lt;/a&gt; registry that is rapidly gaining traction as a successful and trusted service provider with many big name customers. Already purchased your .CO domain elsewhere? Take advantage of this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer&#34;&gt;domain transfer&lt;/a&gt; offer or alternatively stay with your existing registrar whilst still enjoying easy DNS management with our no obligation &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/simplify-your-domain-dns-management.html&#34;&gt;hosted DNS management&lt;/a&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Don&#39;t Squash Your Customers Dreams</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest post by Josh Ledgard &amp;ndash; founder of &lt;a href=&#34;http://kickofflabs.com&#34;&gt;KickoffLabs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your customers have a vision that&amp;rsquo;s uniquely theirs.  Your goal as a product or service provider is to fulfill that dream by getting out of the way and making it easier to achieve than your competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 18 month old son and one of my recent dreams involved teaching him to hit a ball off of a tee.  My wife told me I was crazy and that he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to grasp the concept.  Then the first couple of tee-ball sets I saw said &amp;ldquo;Ages 3+&amp;rdquo;.  The result was that my dream was squashed and I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found a tee-ball set that put the age at &amp;ldquo;18 months + &amp;ldquo;.  My dream was alive and I bought it right away. Sure enough, after an hour of practice my son can put the ball on the tee, grab the bat with two hands, and hit home runs over the couch.  Dream realized&amp;hellip; happy customer. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At KickoffLabs we first based our pricing around the number of customer sign-ups on your landing page.  Even paid accounts were limited to tracking X number of customer signups and emailed newsletters.  But no matter how high we put that number people told us &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll have more than 100,000 customers quickly&amp;hellip; what then?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rationally I knew how hard it would be for ANYONE with a new/small business using our product to hit that kind of number.  But we were killing our customers dreams and that made them less likely to buy our product.  So we changed our pricing model to support unlimited customers so we weren&amp;rsquo;t squashing our customers dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d recommend going through your customer experience today and ask yourself&amp;hellip; am I killing a dream? One better&amp;hellip; ask your customers what they are dreaming about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-08-17-logo-website-kickofflabs.png&#34; alt=&#34;KickOffLabs Logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Ledgard is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&#34;http://kickofflabs.com&#34;&gt;KickoffLabs&lt;/a&gt;. KickoffLabs makes creating landing pages and newsletters for new/small businesses super easy.  KickoffLabs and iwantmyname have teamed up to make your dreams easier to realize by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/kickofflabs-own-domain&#34;&gt;making it a quick two step process to wire your domain up to Kickofflabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Registrations Reflect Web Commerce Explosion</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-07-13-growth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;growth.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of registered domains grew by over 4.5 million in the first three months of 2011, suggesting that the industry remains in good heart. Despite other businesses emerging only tentatively from global economic recession, domain registrars clocked up almost 8% in growth over the previous 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain registration growth rates parallel a burgeoning Internet scene as web services continue to eat into traditional business models. Rapid growth in mobile and social content also draw in ever greater numbers of consumers. Internet infrastructure provider Verisign manages provisioning for .com and .net domains, which make up around half of all registrations and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/why-verisign/research-trends/domain-name-industry-brief/index.xhtml&#34;&gt;reports quarterly&lt;/a&gt; on Internet growth. On average Verisign currently handles an astounding 57 billion domain name system queries each day. At peak levels of demand this can reach 67 billion transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of Global web commerce is expected to reach almost US$1 Trillion within a couple of years and will be a key driver in overall growth of the Internet. Annual mobile commerce currently sits at a mere 2% of consumer sales transactions, but is expected to grow to US$15 billion in value within 5 years in the United States alone. So there remains plenty of scope for growth in new web and mobile commerce Internet offerings &amp;ndash; and in the demand for domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Christchurch Quake Shock</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-02-22-redcross.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cross&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will be aware New Zealand suffered one of it&amp;rsquo;s most devastating natural disasters of modern times earlier today when our second largest city Christchurch was struck by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/user/TVNewZealand#p/a/u/2/KetOf15Q3lc&#34;&gt;severe earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. We already know that many small historic buildings were badly damaged, several large office buildings were completely destroyed and sadly it appears likely that the number of deaths will rise substantially from the first estimate of 65. The region had only just begun to recover from a quite severe quake event in September 2010, but this time it is much more serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts go out to the people of Christchurch and especially to our friends and customers from that region. At this stage of the crisis the main focus is on rescue amidst the debris. If you are worried about a missing friend or family member or would like to help in a practical way, there are a number of resources available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google have set up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://christchurch-2011.person-finder.appspot.com/&#34;&gt;person finder site&lt;/a&gt; that may be of some use.*   Red Cross missing persons phone line 0800 733 276 or +64 7 850 2199&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Google &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/christchurch_earthquake.html&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;.*   Crisis Commons &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/CrisisCampNZ&#34;&gt;wiki site&lt;/a&gt; available online.*   TradeMe &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trademe.co.nz/christchurch-earthquake-support&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; with helpful links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ushahidi &lt;a href=&#34;http://eq.org.nz/&#34;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; with localised information and civil defence updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make an offer of accomodation in &lt;a href=&#34;http://archived.link/http://www.wellington.govt.nz/news/display-item.php?id=4334&#34;&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; for evacuees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://findaroom.org.nz/&#34;&gt;Findaroom&lt;/a&gt; accomodation site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offers of &lt;a href=&#34;http://archived.link/http://www.aucklandnz.com/index.php/content_B/?L1=36&amp;amp;L2=27&amp;amp;L3=&amp;amp;id=6160&#34;&gt;accommodation&lt;/a&gt; in Auckland for evacuees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To arrange to donate blood in NZ call 0800 GIVE BLOOD (0800 448 325).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate cash to assist the Salvation Army&amp;rsquo;s efforts in Chrischurch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local New Zealand government phone emergency helpline for people affected by the quake &lt;strong&gt;0800 779 997&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: 2pm Thur 24 Feb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to donate cash to help the relief effort, we recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redcross.org.nz/&#34;&gt;New Zealand Red Cross website&lt;/a&gt; which is now fully operational again thanks to a collaborative effort amongst techies here in Wellington. We&amp;rsquo;ve also helped out with getting &lt;a href=&#34;http://eq.org.nz/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eq.org.nz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to search for domains using your browser&#39;s address bar, AlfredApp, and DuckDuckGo</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to quickly search for domain names from the address bar of your favorite browser, app launcher or search engine, we have some tips how to set things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Safari (using Glims)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;AlfredApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Safari (using Glims)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.machangout.com/&#34;&gt;Glims&lt;/a&gt; is not only useful for custom keyword search but also adds lots of other helpful features to Safari. You need to install this plugin first to do the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-02-21-search-domain-glims.png&#34; alt=&#34;search-domain-glims.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Glims go to you Safari preferences, add iwantmyname to the search engine list using the URL &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=#query#&lt;/code&gt; and choose the keyword for your custom query. All you have to do now is enter &lt;code&gt;iwmn domainname&lt;/code&gt; (or any other keyword of your choice) in your browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar and you will get our domain search result in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a bookmark in Firefox and replace the domain in our search URL, e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=yourdomainname&lt;/code&gt; needs to be replaced with &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=%s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-02-21-firefox-custom-search-add.png&#34; alt=&#34;firefox-custom-search-add.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding a tag of your choice, you can now type &lt;code&gt;tagname domainname&lt;/code&gt; in your address bar which will give you the results for your domain search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mycroft.mozdev.org/search-engines.html?category=29&#34;&gt;iwantmyname Open Search plugin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jannisgundermann.com&#34;&gt;Jannis Gundermann&lt;/a&gt; to add our domain search to Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Chrome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A right-click in your address bar lets you edit the search engines Chrome uses. Simply add our search URL &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=%s&lt;/code&gt; and add the keyword you would like to use for your custom search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-02-21-google-chrome-domain-search-iwantmyname.png&#34; alt=&#34;google-chrome-domain-search-iwantmyname.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/muloka&#34;&gt;Louis Galipeau&lt;/a&gt;, you can also search for domains at iwantmyname directly from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://duckduckgo.com&#34;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; search box. Just enter &lt;code&gt;!iwant domainname&lt;/code&gt; and you will be forwarded to the search result page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2011-02-21-duckduckgo-domain-search.png&#34; alt=&#34;duckduckgo-domain-search.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;AlfredApp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://alfredapp.com&#34;&gt;Swiss knife of all app launchers&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to add custom searches. Go to &lt;em&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Features &amp;gt; Custom Searches&lt;/em&gt; and add the following domain search URL: &lt;code&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain={query}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now define a keyword and you can immediately search from the AlfredApp window.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Some Browser Statistics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought this two years ago. &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com/chrome&#34;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; was accounting for 41% of our visitors in December with &lt;a href=&#34;http://firefox.com&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; ranking 2nd (27%) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/safari&#34;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; 3rd (21.50%). From the 5% using Internet Explorer, 70% are browsing with IE8+.
We quite like this.

				<title>A Big Thank You For 2010</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is turning 2 years old in December 2010 and I&amp;rsquo;d like to personally thank you for supporting us thus far. While our first year was focused on getting everything up and running, the second year has been mainly about improving the stability and performance of iwantmyname. We are now already looking forward to 2011 with further improvements in mind, especially to the dashboard, domain search and overall usability of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would also love to receive comments from our valued customers. If you have any technical issues or complaints, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;tell us what we can do better&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you had a good experience, please share with your friends. Every referral and every piece of feedback helps us to build the best experience for domain seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable holiday season &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;from the whole team&lt;/a&gt; at iwantmyname!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timo Reitnauer&lt;/strong&gt;
Co-founder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>SSL, Cookies and Caching</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we go again, the SSL topic is up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1827928&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more! &lt;a href=&#34;http://codebutler.com/firesheep&#34;&gt;Firesheep&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful tool to play with and once again we are in the middle of the security versus performance discussion. Session hijacking is a serious threat, but whether or not it is a threat to you really depends heavily on the environment you operate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief issue with SSL is that today&amp;rsquo;s Javascript heavy pages load slowly because caching does not work under SSL. This brings down the performance significantly and may be a reason for those who don&amp;rsquo;t care about security to go elsewhere (and there are many who are willing to trade speed for security). A hybrid approach, involving loading the page itself in HTTPS and the Javascript and CSS files in HTTP, does not work either because it breaks the HTTPS browser security and confuses visitors more than it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this dilemma we decided that because we are in the fortunate situation that our customers are generally more of a tech savvy crowd &amp;ndash; we can let them choose. If you are in the safe environment of your office, where you trust the ones who listen to your traffic, you may choose to trade security for speed and switch off the SSL protection for URLs that are considered safe. But if you are in a conference where normally some script kiddies listen to your traffic, it is a good idea to switch on the new session protection so that all traffic is SSL encrypted from the moment you log into our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does the standard SSL protection work on iwantmyname? We decided that some pages hold sensitive information and that we will only ever display them on HTTPS secured pages. However, others are not as sensitive and we display them on plain HTTP to gain some speed. All pages that handle passwords of any kind (including authorization codes for domain transfers) or billing information are secure, whereas others like your dashboard that only hold general information are served via HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this gives security for the individual pages it does not secure against session hijacking. To enable SSL for the entire time your session is authorized on our page we added a new switch. In your Dashboard under &amp;ldquo;Account &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Settings&amp;rdquo; is a switch for security settings. Enabling this switch will set your entire session to SSL irrespective of whether you are browsing our public website or looking at your credit card data. While this might slow down things a bit, it protects effectively against session hijacking and makes sure your domains are as safe as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing you with this option we think that we can give you the flexibility to decide what level of security you need and then take the appropriate action.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Registrar Storefront</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; we feel strongly that more innovation is needed within the global domain registrar industry. That&amp;rsquo;s why we developed our registrar platform from the ground up. Our philosophy revolves around providing a spam free, easy to use interface that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of the customer. Acquiring and managing domains shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of customers worldwide already use our services and the number is growing daily. This extraordinary level of growth has encouraged us to continually add new features and to improve the existing technology. We launched sites in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://meinname.de/&#34;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://benikvrij.nl/&#34;&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; markets and new partners can roll out the platform in their own language within a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big opportunities that we see on the horizon is Internationalised Domain Names (IDN). This allows domain seekers to secure their digital identity using non-Latin character sets such as Arabic, Chinese or Cyrillic for example. Unlike many registrars, iwantmyname is already fully enabled for IDN. Want to allow your business customers to search for and register 新年快乐.com? No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sites have received &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;glowing reviews&lt;/a&gt; from many satisfied users all around the world. Now we are actively seeking &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/partner&#34;&gt;partnerships&lt;/a&gt; both in New Zealand and abroad. For bloggers and other high traffic sites we can offer a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/affiliate&#34;&gt;affiliate program&lt;/a&gt; that only takes minutes to set up. We pay you for any sales that are completed after click-throughs from your own website. The programme is managed by a completely independent service provider who works everything out and then sends you a cheque periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For technical deployments such as integrating our API, white label reseller solution or a tailor made site that reflects a particular language or cultural setting, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New DNS Manager</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks we experienced some issues with our DNS manager. The result was that a small number of our customers could not update DNS records properly. For this we sincerely apologise. First our back end played up, later it was a problem with the user interface after we changed our website form framework. We should stress that the continuity of the DNS service was maintained at all times. The majority of customers will not have experienced any problem at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing our website forms also resulted in some of your support inquiries not reaching us. So if you did not receive an email response to a support request within 24 hours, please re-submit your message. Again, we are sorry for this problem and the delay in getting back to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take our responsibilities to you very seriously,
so we have made some changes to set things straight. We&amp;rsquo;ve now
released a new iteration of our DNS manager and also switched to a more
scalable back end. As a result, all domain registrations will use the
following nameservers hostnames from now on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ns1.iwantmyname.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ns2.iwantmyname.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ns3.iwantmyname.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ns4.iwantmyname.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing
 domain names will be migrated to the new DNS infrastructure
over the next few days without any service interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for your support and patience whilst we
experienced
these growing pains. Responding to feedback from our customers is how we
 improve, so please feel free to yell at us on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iwantmynameNZ&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, drop us an
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:help@support.iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt; email&lt;/a&gt; or leave &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support&#34;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; if you encounter any problems in
the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Top 10 Domain Rankings 2010: .NET Soon To Be Second Largest Namespace?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The .NET domain extension might soon overtake Germany&amp;rsquo;s .DE as second largest top-level domain after the market leading .COM web address according to the latest domain name statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.COM&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;88.7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.DE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;13.7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;13.3 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.UK&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;8.7 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.ORG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;8.5 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.CN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;6.9 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.INFO&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;6.6 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;4.0 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.EU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;3.2 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.RU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;2.9 million&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hosterstats.com/DomainNameCounts2010.php&#34;&gt;Hoster Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how some positions have changed in comparison to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&#34;&gt;top 10 domain name statistics from last year&lt;/a&gt;. While most domain extensions growing strongly, e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/there-are-now-8-5-million-org-domains-and-growth-is-accelerating/&#34;&gt;.ORG grew from 7.7 to 8.5 million names&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese .CN suffix dropped from 2nd into 6th place after having changed the registration rules a few months back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another milestone for the domain name industry will be &lt;a href=&#34;http://domainincite.com/top-level-domain-count-likely-to-top-300-this-year/&#34;&gt;the passing of 300 domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; with the introduction of more internationalized country code domains. A number we will likely see increase over the coming years with the introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html&#34;&gt;new top-level domains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Simplifying DNS and Domain Management</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/&#34;&gt;iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; we want to make it a lot easier to hook up your favourite web apps to your chosen domain. Our web app directory already contains &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory&#34;&gt;more than 30 services&lt;/a&gt; including the following categories: &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting&#34;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder&#34;&gt;website builder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/forum-hosting&#34;&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting&#34;&gt;ecommerce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting&#34;&gt;portfolios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/social-network&#34;&gt;social networks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/url-shortener&#34;&gt;url shortener&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/wiki-hosting&#34;&gt;wikis&lt;/a&gt;. There is a handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory&#34;&gt;overview page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all the available apps and services. In addition to the web apps we&amp;rsquo;ve also provided additional documentation and information within the user dashboard to assist with more specific custom domain mapping of your favourite service. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin&#34;&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt; and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these major upgrades to the dashboard we&amp;rsquo;ve made it a whole lot easier, not only for website administrators, developers or sys admins who require greater control over domain set-up, but also for users with a non-technical background. These changes are intended to dramatically improve the ability of our customers to manage their domain names and personalise services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2010-05-19-services-setup1-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;services setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS management tool has been completely re-written and is available from the dashboard when logged in. It offers an easy-peasy way to handle domain set-ups in more detail. Let us know if you have any troubles using it &amp;ndash; we always love to get feedback so we can further improve the iwantmyname platform. There are some big future plans for DNS management on the site, which will be especially interesting for developers. We will let you know, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kiwi Born iwantmyname Returns From Big O.E.</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;iwantmyname is the world&amp;rsquo;s most innovative domain registrar platform and was developed by our &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideegeo.com&#34;&gt;parent company&lt;/a&gt; based right here in Wellington, New Zealand. With a new wave of web-based ventures emerging on the New Zealand tech scene and a paradigm shift underway in the way we access distributed computing services globally, it seems like a good time to introduce our domain registrar platform to our home audience.
We first launched iwantmyname into the U.S. market at the end of 2008 with the aim of satisfying a growing demand from customers for a cleaner, quicker way to register domains. As we anticipated, there was an enthusiastic uptake, especially from the web developer and designer community who immediately grasped the benefits of a much more user-friendly interface. Our offer of some free services not provided by many of the big domain registrars sealed the deal in the minds of many.
During 2009 we were hard at work listening to our users, refining the platform technology and looking into other markets. We were soon approached by a partner in the Netherlands who had an existing hosting business and was keen to set up a Dutch language version of the site on a license basis. A German version of iwantmyname followed shortly afterwards. With sites operating successfully in three of the largest global markets for domains, it was time to refocus our attention on the local market.
A lot of our Kiwi friends had begun to discover iwantmyname offshore and we had received an increasing number of requests for a New Zealand dollar denominated site. Like many Kiwis that venture offshore, it was time for iwantmyname to return home. The January Linux Conference proved to be the perfect opportunity to launch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz&#34;&gt;New Zealand version of iwantmyname&lt;/a&gt; and to get some nice feedback from actual users who visited our trade stand at the event.
If you have already used the NZ site &amp;ndash; thank-you for supporting a local business! If you only just heard about us, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin&#34;&gt;try a free account&lt;/a&gt; and check out our current &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domain-promo-nz&#34;&gt;special offers&lt;/a&gt;. You can even be our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/iwantmyname-NZ/118040718222943?ref=ts&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; friend &amp;ndash; we love feedback!

				<title>10 Most Popular Services To Forward Your Domain To</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Domain name redirection or web (URL) forwarding is one of the easiest ways to start using &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;your own web address&lt;/a&gt; and is a service we provide free to all customers at iwantmyname. With this option you can forward domains to any other public location on the internet. Although it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the preferred setup, it makes perfect sense under some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would you choose to redirect a domain name? First, some web services do not support &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;custom domains&lt;/a&gt; but only offer to get a username tied to their web address in the form of &lt;em&gt;domain.com/username&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. &lt;em&gt;twitter.com/username&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;facebook.com/username&lt;/em&gt;. In this case forwarding is the only option to point a domain to the respective site. Secondly, a redirection comes in handy if you haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what to do with a new internet address yet. By forwarding a domain, you could let all visitors go to a Facebook page or LinkedIn profile instead of presenting them with a blank site or an error message in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s our top 10 list of services to forward to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; profile / page -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com/username&#34;&gt;http://facebook.com/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; _&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/username&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/username&lt;/a&gt; _&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://linkedin.com&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://linkedin.com/in/username&#34;&gt;http://linkedin.com/in/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://profiles.google.com&#34;&gt;Google Profiles&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://profiles.google.com/username&#34;&gt;http://profiles.google.com/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; fotos -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com/photos/username&#34;&gt;http://flickr.com/photos/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; videos -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/user/username&#34;&gt;http://youtube.com/user/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; videos -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/username&#34;&gt;http://vimeo.com/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://last.fm&#34;&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; music -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://last.fm/user/username&#34;&gt;http://last.fm/user/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://myspace.com&#34;&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://myspace.com/username&#34;&gt;http://myspace.com/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca&#34;&gt;Identi.ca&lt;/a&gt; profile -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://identi.ca/username&#34;&gt;http://identi.ca/username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides linking your domain to only one of the mentioned services, you could also create your own namespace like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/status&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; forward to Twitter or Identi.ca
&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/profile&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; forward to LinkedIn or Google Profiles
&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/video&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; forward to Youtube or Vimeo
&lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/music&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; forward to Last.fm or MySpace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the drift&amp;hellip; only by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;owning a domain name&lt;/a&gt; and having control over the full web address, are you actually able to change the destination at any point in time. Don&amp;rsquo;t like Twitter anymore? Simply change &lt;em&gt;yourdomainname.com/status&lt;/em&gt; to another service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up free domain forwarding through your domain management interface at iwantmyname.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Short URL Domain Name Ideas for Customizing bit.ly Pro</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Popular URL shortening service &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly&#34; title=&#34;bit.ly&#34;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt; is launching an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.bit.ly/post/356400453/bit-ly-pro-open-beta-and-enterprise-service&#34; title=&#34;bit.ly Pro open beta&#34;&gt;open beta&lt;/a&gt; of its long-awaited Pro version with custom domain option soon. This will allow you to use your own domain name for a personally branded URL instead of the standard shortened addresses starting with bit.ly or j.mp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bit.ly Pro is completely free and has the following features included:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10,000 requests / day for your custom short URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the bit.ly Pro dashboard with detailed statistics on your branded links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bit.ly button to allow users share links on Twitter / Facebook with your custom domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will also be an Enterprise edition with support for multiple domains, advanced dashboard features, full end-to-end branding and a customer service support plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Short URL Domain Name Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some domain name ideas for you to find a memorable short domain. You should try to keep it simple yet still readable. Do not obsess to much about the length, 5-7 characters will still work fine. It is not so much the brevity that is important but the recognition value of your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use abbreviations / misspellings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company: comp or cmpny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YourDesignBlog: yodebl or yrdsgn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iwantmyname: iwmn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play with initials:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FirstnameLastname: FL or FiLa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New York Agency: NYA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a domain hack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPeople: ipeo.pl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Youtube: youtu.be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YourName: yrna.me (domain hack / misspelling combined)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register a boutique domain extension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; (It&amp;rsquo;s me&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory&#34;&gt;.IO&lt;/a&gt; (Input/Output)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tw-taiwanese-domain-name-registration-for-taiwan&#34;&gt;.TW&lt;/a&gt; (for Twitter!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get creative using Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symbols / special characters: ✪df.ws or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=20°f.la&#34;&gt;20°f.la&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/name-generator/turn-words-upside-down&#34;&gt;Upside down domain names&lt;/a&gt;: ǝɯɐu.name (name.name) or ʇɹoɥs.com (short.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Host And Share Files On Your Custom Domain With Droplr</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://droplr.com&#34; title=&#34;Droplr&#34;&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt; is a little Mac application that runs in your menubar and can be used for uploading, hosting and sharing files with your favourite Twitter client or other apps. What we really like with Droplr is the custom domain option. Simply enter your own &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search&#34; title=&#34;Short Domain Search&#34;&gt;short domain name&lt;/a&gt; into their web application, change the DNS A record settings and all links to your hosted files will contain your branded URL immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s best to see it in action so watch the demo video below and see how easy Droplr works with Twitter or email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu_BP1RRN7w&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service is currently in private beta but we could score some invites for you which will be raffled among all commenters to this blog post (don&amp;rsquo;t forget to leave your email address).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Is The Ranking of My Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD)? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part V</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The last part of our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series shows the ranking of country code top-level domains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&#34; title=&#34;How many TLDs exist in total?&#34;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domains-are-registered-in-total.html&#34; title=&#34;Total Number Of Domain Registrations Worldwide?&#34;&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&#34; title=&#34;Top 10 Domain Extensions&#34;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&#34;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.DE Takes Lead Again in ccTLD Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered where your country domain extension sits in the global marketplace? It&amp;rsquo;s a little bit like Formula One, with nations jockeying constantly for supremacy. Recently German suffix .DE pipped China&amp;rsquo;s .CN domain to a pole position with slightly more registrations. That&amp;rsquo;s good news for iwantmyname because we are about to launch a &lt;a href=&#34;http://meinname.com&#34;&gt;German language version&lt;/a&gt; of our highly successful domain management platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a handy reference list showing which ccTLDs are most popular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful resource for these domain name statistics is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icann.org/idashboard/public/&#34; title=&#34;ICANN Public Dashboard&#34;&gt;ICANN Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; which provides an interactive timeline on the growth of generic TLDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of registered gTLDs and their ranking is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COM: 82.01 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NET: 12.42 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.ORG: 7.79 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.INFO: 5.24 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.BIZ: 2.03 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.MOBI: ~ 850.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NAME: ~ 300.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TEL: ~ 220.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.ASIA: ~ 210.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.TRAVEL: ~130.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.CAT: ~38.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.PRO: ~37.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.JOBS: ~16.000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.AERO: ~6.500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COOP: ~5.800&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.MUSEUM: ~550&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total number of generic domain extensions (September 2009): 111.3 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What Are The Top 10 Global Domain Extensions? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part III</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post showing the top 10 list of domain extensions is part 3 of our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&#34; title=&#34;How many TLDs exist in total?&#34;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Top 10 global domain name extension list&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ten largest domain extensions unite a whopping 150 million registrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;: 82.01 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany&#34;&gt;.DE&lt;/a&gt; (Germany): 13.05 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cn-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china&#34;&gt;.CN&lt;/a&gt; (China): 12.55 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&#34;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;: 12.42 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&#34;&gt;.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom): 7.83 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&#34;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt;: 7.79 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&#34;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt;: 5.24 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands&#34;&gt;.NL&lt;/a&gt; (Netherlands): 3.5 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&#34;&gt;.EU&lt;/a&gt; (European Union): 2.98 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ru-russian-domain-name-registration-for-russian-federation&#34;&gt;.RU&lt;/a&gt; (Russia): 2.31 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.COM is by far the the largest namespace worldwide, followed by the German .DE internet code, the Chinese .CN country domain extension and the generic .NET web address. It is very likely that .CN will surpass .DE again shortly (they recently changed positions). However, it will be interesting to see which impact the introduction of a suffix with Chinese characters such as .中国 (.CHINA) might have on the future growth of the .CN address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers also show how strong country domain extensions are in Europe with .UK, .NL and .EU taking further positions after .ORG and .INFO in the international Top 10 ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How Many Domains Are Registered In Total? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part II</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This is part two in our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series which answers the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domain-extensions-exist-worldwide-statistics-numbers.html&#34; title=&#34;How many TLDs exist in total?&#34;&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&#34;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&#34;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html&#34;&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Part 2: How many domains are registered worldwide?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the latest &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.verisign.com/Resources/Naming_Services_Resources/Domain_Name_Industry_Brief/&#34; title=&#34;VeriSign Domain Industry Brief&#34;&gt;VeriSign&amp;rsquo;s Domain Industry Brief&lt;/a&gt; there were &lt;strong&gt;184 million domain name registrations across all top-level domains&lt;/strong&gt; by the end of the second quarter 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graph shows the growth over time and the distribution between different domain extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2009-09-30-graph-how-many-domains-worldwide.png&#34; alt=&#34;Total Domain Name Registrations Graph&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these 184 million total registrations, &lt;strong&gt;gTLDs account for 109.6 million registered domains and ccTLDs have a registration base of 74.4 million addresses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other quick facts about the domain name industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20.9 million new domain names registered in the first six months of 2009.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.COM &amp;amp; .NET account for 50% of all domains registered worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top 10 country code domain extensions comprise 66 per cent of all ccTLD registrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top 3 ccTLDs .DE, .CN &amp;amp; .UK represent 45 percent of all registered ccTLD names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.AR (Argentina), .RU (Russia) and .BR (Brazil) are currently the fastest growing ccTLDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed Information about industry growth rates and ccTLD statistics can be found in the September 2009 issue of the Domain Industry Brief: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.verisign.com/domain-name-services/domain-information-center/domain-name-resources/domain-name-report-sept09.pdf&#34; title=&#34;Domain Industry Brief September 2009 PDF&#34;&gt;PDF Download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How Many Domain Name Extensions Exist Worldwide? Statistics &amp; Numbers, Part I</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there are 280 internet domain extensions in total? And that .COM &amp;amp; .NET account for 50% of all domains registered worldwide? Or maybe you have always wondered what the most popular country code domains are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;em&gt;Domain Statistics &amp;amp; Numbers&lt;/em&gt; article series we will answer these questions and provide you with some interesting numbers around the global domain name space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/09/how-many-domains-are-registered-in-total.html&#34;&gt;How many domains are registered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/top-10-global-domain-extensions-statistics-numbers.html&#34;&gt;What are the Top 10 global domain extensions&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/how-big-are-the-generic-top-level-domain-namespaces-statistics-numbers-part-iv.html&#34;&gt;How big are the generic top-level domain (gTLD) namespaces&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html&#34;&gt;What is the ranking of my country code top-level domain (ccTLD)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we go with the first anwer. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: How many top-level domain name extensions exist in total?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2009-09-25-blogtld-census-480px.png&#34; alt=&#34;tld census&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.icann.org/2009/03/tld-census/&#34;&gt;ICANN Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have &lt;strong&gt;280 domain extensions in total&lt;/strong&gt;. The two main groups are the so-called gTLDs (generic top-level domains) and the ccTLDs (country code top-level domains). We will go into more detail about gTLD and ccTLD registration numbers later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic top-level domains:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20 generic TLD suffixes are used mostly internationally and represent the vast majority of all registered domains worldwide. They are divided into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 unrestricted TLDs:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial&#34; title=&#34;.COM Domain&#34;&gt;.COM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network&#34; title=&#34;.NET Domain&#34;&gt;.NET&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation&#34; title=&#34;.ORG Domain&#34;&gt;.ORG&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&#34; title=&#34;.INFO domain&#34;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt; (can be purchased by anyone without any restrictions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Generic-restricted TLDs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/biz-domain-name-registration-for-business&#34; title=&#34;.BIZ Domain&#34;&gt;.BIZ&lt;/a&gt; (for Businesses), &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names&#34; title=&#34;.NAME domain&#34;&gt;.NAME&lt;/a&gt; (for Individuals) &amp;amp; .PRO (for credentialed professionals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13 Sponsored TLDs: .AERO, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia&#34; title=&#34;.ASIA Domain&#34;&gt;.ASIA&lt;/a&gt;, .CAT, .COOP, .EDU (US only), .GOV (US only), .INT, .JOBS, .MIL (US only), &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mobi-domain-name-registration-for-mobile&#34; title=&#34;.MOBI domain&#34;&gt;.MOBI&lt;/a&gt;, .MUSEUM, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication&#34; title=&#34;.TEL Domain&#34;&gt;.TEL&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; .TRAVEL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country code top-level domains:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries of this world are represented on the internet by 248 ccTLDs altogether:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;242 are based on the official English short names after the ISO 3166-1 standard. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/&#34; title=&#34;IANA root zone database&#34;&gt;list of all country code extensions&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the IANA root zone database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptionally reserved codes are: &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ac-domain-name-registration-for-ascension-island&#34; title=&#34;.AC Domain&#34;&gt;.AC&lt;/a&gt; (Ascension Island), &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe&#34; title=&#34;.EU Domain&#34;&gt;.EU&lt;/a&gt; (European Union) &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom&#34; title=&#34;.UK Domain&#34;&gt;.UK&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom, offical ISO short name is GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former country codes: .SU (Soviet Union), .TP (Portuguese Timor, now &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste&#34; title=&#34;.TL Domain Registration&#34;&gt;.TL&lt;/a&gt; for Timor-Leste) &amp;amp; .YU (Yugoslavia, split into &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro&#34; title=&#34;.ME Domain&#34;&gt;.ME&lt;/a&gt; for Montenegro and .RS for Serbia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New top-level domain extensions (outlook):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/06/list-new-gtld-domain-extensions-2010.html&#34; title=&#34;New domain extensions&#34;&gt;new top-level domain extensions&lt;/a&gt; will change the domain landscape. If ICANN sticks to its current plan to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtld-program.htm&#34; title=&#34;New gTLD program&#34;&gt;expand the internet address space&lt;/a&gt; with new addresses such as .BERLIN, .NYC or .RADIO next year, we should see a completely different picture in about 3 years. The 20 &amp;ldquo;g&amp;rdquo;s could be more like 200-500 then and will surpass the country codes by far on the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your prediction for the number of TLDs by the end of 2012? We&amp;rsquo;d love to see them in the comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain Search Bookmarklet &amp; More Tools For Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often the little tools that make the services we love really useful. Therefore we&amp;rsquo;ve added another way to check domain availability at iwantmyname. With the domain search bookmarklet you can &lt;strong&gt;select any word or text in a browser window and click on the bookmarklet to check whether the respective domain is available or not&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install the domain search bookmarklet you just have to drag the following link to your bookmarks bar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Domain Search&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also visit our new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools&#34; title=&#34;Domain Search Tools&#34;&gt;domain tools overview&lt;/a&gt; page where we&amp;rsquo;ve listed all the other iwantmyname gadgets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/iphone&#34; title=&#34;Register domains from your iPhone&#34;&gt;iPhone DomainApp&lt;/a&gt; for domain registration on the go&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Your First Name Under .COM Might Still Be Available (Upside Down)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Now you can not only &lt;a href=&#34;http://mashable.com/2009/08/10/flipmytext/&#34;&gt;publish status updates for Twitter or Facebook in a cool way&lt;/a&gt; but also register very unique domain names. So why not astonish your friends with an upside down domain of your first name? Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/name-generator/turn-words-upside-down&#34; title=&#34;Domain Name Generator Tool FlipMyName&#34;&gt;fun domain name generator FlipMyName&lt;/a&gt; makes this possible. Just enter your name and you&amp;rsquo;ll be presented with a flipped version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Available first names under .COM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim &amp;ndash; ʇıɯ.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James &amp;ndash; ɾɐɯǝs.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark &amp;ndash; ʞɹɐɯ.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John &amp;ndash; uɥoɾ.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fun for sharing links on Twitter, Facebook or in your email and forum footer. You could also &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/08/10-tools-to-run-an-url-shortener-on-your-own-custom-domain.html&#34; title=&#34;create your own URL shortener&#34;&gt;create your own URL shortener&lt;/a&gt; with it. The technology behind this is around for years by the way. Domains are registered as &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&#34; title=&#34;Register IDNs - Internationalised Domain Names&#34;&gt;IDNs&lt;/a&gt; (Internationalised Domain Names) and are accessible by any modern browser.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Search IDNs with the Virtual Keyboard</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We have received a lot of positive feedback in the local community about our recent announcement for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/07/idn-internationalised-domain-names-with-special-characters.html&#34; title=&#34;Internationalised Domain Names&#34;&gt;Internationalised Domain Names&lt;/a&gt; with Māori macrons. A question we were asked quite often was how you can actually enter special characters on an English keyboard layout. While most operating systems have character tables to help you entering letters of foreign alphabets, we now have an easier alternative for you online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names&#34; title=&#34;Virtual Keyboard IDN search and registration&#34;&gt;Virtual Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; allows you to choose from different non-English keyboard layouts.&lt;/strong&gt; You just need to change the respective language and can start typing in Chinese, Japanese, Greek or Hebrew. Unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support one of our favourite languages but &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language&#34; title=&#34;Klingon IDNs?&#34;&gt;Klingon&lt;/a&gt; still hasn&amp;rsquo;t made it into the official UTF-8 standard&amp;hellip; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;IDN Punycode Converter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another little domain tool for IDNs is our IDN Punycode converter. All Internationalised Domain Names are converted into ASCII characters using Punycode to make them readable in the Domain Name System (DNS). So instead of the domain müller.com, computers actually read xn&amp;mdash;mller-kva.com. The tool might be helpful to find out the ASCII syntax of an IDN. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/idns/idn-punycode-converter&#34; title=&#34;IDN conversion tool punycode&#34;&gt;Check out the IDN Punycode converter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Support For Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.koreromaori.co.nz/news/mlw&#34; title=&#34;Māori Language Week&#34;&gt;Māori Language Week&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand and on this occasion we&amp;rsquo;re very proud to announce support for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name&#34; title=&#34;Internationalised Domain Names&#34;&gt;Internationalised Domain Names&lt;/a&gt; (IDNs) at iwantmyname. Indigenous groups around the world are looking seriously at how best to protect their digital identity, as the Internet continues to impact powerfully in both in economic and sociological terms. Providing Internationalised Domain Names not only for the use of Māori language domains but non-Latin characters in general is a small but significant step towards preserving the expression of language and culture online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationalised Domain Names can be accessed in any modern web browser such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer (&amp;gt; Version 7.0 which is another reaseon why &lt;a href=&#34;http://mashable.com/2009/07/16/ie6-must-die/&#34; title=&#34;IE6 must die&#34;&gt;IE 6 must die&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDNs at iwantmyname are currently supported in the following domain extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic top-level domains&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Real-time DNS Management For Your Domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Having total &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system&#34;&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt; control has been one of the most requested features of our power users. DNS is not only the underlying technology for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns&#34;&gt;Domains for Apps&lt;/a&gt; but also probably &lt;a href=&#34;http://archived.link/http://blog.mosso.com/2009/06/dns-the-overlooked-cloud-service/&#34;&gt;the most overlooked cloud service&lt;/a&gt;. Hence we are pleased now to offer a low-level DNS editor which gives you full control over your domains and lets you manage DNS records completely in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new DNS editor supports A, CNAME, MX, AAAA, TXT &amp;amp; SRV records. Have a look at this shiny new tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2009-06-10-real-time-dns-management-editor.png&#34; alt=&#34;real-time-dns-management-editor.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we appreciate your feedback in the comments, our &lt;a href=&#34;http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
