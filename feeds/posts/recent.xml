				<title>Friday break - &#34;Reply All #59: Good Job, Alex&#34;</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you like podcasts, this is one of my favorites. And this episode is about domain names!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/59-good-job-alex/&#34;&gt;From Reply All, episode #59&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALEX: So I was thinking, “Wow.” So Alisa had this website. She had it professionally designed many moons ago. When it was still really hard to design a website. So had someone design it for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJ: Like HTML days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALEX: Yes. But it was really clunky and difficult to use, so she started getting notices from GoDaddy, and she was just like, fine, this thing can expire. But the thing is, that she didn’t quite understand what would happen when you let your domain name expire. I think she just assumed that the site itself would go away, but nothing would happen to the domain name. Like she could come back to it whenever she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJ: Mm mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALEX: Are you saying, “No she didn’t think that,” or “No that’s not what happens?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PJ: I’m saying the thing she believed in the past was not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Meet Merlene, the newest iwantmynamer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/media/2016-03-16-merlene.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Merlene&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merlene is a self-described hoarder. Fortunately, she hoards domains, and not cats or anything weird. (She insists that two cats do not qualify as a hoard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been self-employed for a long time, Merlene is familiar with all sides of the online business game, from registering domains to teaching customers how to post content and use their email accounts. She has extensive experience working with everyone from IT staff to small business people to complete newbs, so she can help figure out what you need and get it built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also help with your social media and marketing efforts, mix you a killer cocktail, and knit you cool stuff. (She&amp;rsquo;s a hobbyist yarn entrepreneur at &lt;a href=&#34;https://knitcreek.com/&#34;&gt;knitcreek.com&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, even though Merlene didn&amp;rsquo;t mention in her interviews the fact that long ago, in the mists of Internet time, she contributed to one of the Internets for Dummies books, we were totally jazzed to hire her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her first weeks on board, we threw her in the deep end with support, and she&amp;rsquo;s done swimmingly. She even tackles tricky ccTLD edge cases with gusto. Unfortunately, while she&amp;rsquo;s with us in New Zealand, her home is without tech support, and the residents may end up forced to converse with each other, or just post cat gifs&amp;hellip; assuming internet access holds&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. It is, indeed, Merlene with three Es.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Writing on the web, as an individual, is changing (probably for the better)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time, not so long ago, when building a grand personal website sounded like a great idea. People – regular people – were committing a few hours a day to it, and actually making money. But somewhere around the middle of the 2000&amp;rsquo;s, social media got big, people started expressing themselves with shortform content, and consistently writing medium-to-longform posts became a major chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I go and poll my friends and coworkers, the ones who still have traditional blogs are almost all living with a touch of guilt. Their online castles are outdated, their latest posts are collecting cobwebs, and the majority of their real writing is either going to their work or their social media accounts. (BTW, if this describes you, Timo recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html&#34;&gt;wrote a great post&lt;/a&gt; about some alternative things you can do with your domain(s).)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But blogging isn&amp;rsquo;t dead. Far from it. It&amp;rsquo;s just different. Sure, there are those who still have dedicated personal blogs, but the newest trend is to push infrequent content to platforms that already have a huge reach, like Medium. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/03/medium-plans-publisher-monetization-within-a-month-considers-paywalls-and-premium-content/&#34;&gt;recent quote&lt;/a&gt; from Medium founder, Ev Williams,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think publishers who are experimenting with Medium are seeing a world where it’s not about having a website,” said Williams. “There are not going to be tens of millions of websites that lots of people go to every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Medium offers is a way for people to write what they want with a solid CMS, on a platform that takes style decisions away from the author. That probably sounds terrible to some, but for many people, it&amp;rsquo;s a way to express themselves without having to worry about the stuff they&amp;rsquo;re not good at. Just write something up, hit publish, and let people read. Once they&amp;rsquo;re done, they won&amp;rsquo;t judge you for not updating often enough or having an outdated site, they&amp;rsquo;ll just hit next and read one of the other million posts Medium has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I see it. The dream of the internet is to be able to share yourself – your ideas, your art, your dreams – with like-minded peope everywhere. It connects us. But what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that not everyone needs a castle for their personal thoughts. A castle requires a ton of upkeep. Instead, a lot of us might just need a small house to store stuff in. If you&amp;rsquo;re writing tweets, Facebook posts, Medium entries, taking pictures with Instagram, and trying out a handful of other platforms, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need a personal blog on a personal website to feel guilty about not keeping up with. All you need is a little &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html#section-3&#34;&gt;one-pager&lt;/a&gt; that links to all the things you do so you can keep track of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a new resume and need to find that link to that great post you wrote last year? With a good one-pager, it&amp;rsquo;ll be easy to find. Can&amp;rsquo;t remember what photo app that good picture of your dog is on? With a good one-pager, it&amp;rsquo;ll be easy to find. Want to direct a new friend, client, or employer to a place where they can see all the work you do without needing to sift through ten different web platforms? One-pager. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum this up (I like a good, clear takeaway), stop feeling guilty, as I always do, about spending your time writing on platforms that aren&amp;rsquo;t owned and designed by you. Getting your thoughts out there is more important than worrying about the authenticity of writing on a personal blog. If you want a blog, great! But if you just feel like writing every once in a while, publish it anywhere! Just, for the sake of not writing something you&amp;rsquo;ll forget about in a year, get a little website that links to your stuff wherever it&amp;rsquo;s posted.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to help us solve your domain and account questions faster</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you contact us about a question or problem you&amp;rsquo;re having, obviously you want it sorted out quickly. We want that, too. So here&amp;rsquo;s an outline of what we need to know to help you as quickly and painlessly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it will be pretty straightforward, but on the off chance you have an issue that can&amp;rsquo;t be fixed immediately, you&amp;rsquo;ll now have a better understanding of why that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;About you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;About your domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;About the problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll work, don&amp;rsquo;t worry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;About you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you contact support, the most fundamental thing we need to know is that you are, in fact, the real account holder (or, at least, someone like a web developer who the account holder has granted access).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to do this is to log in to your account and then use &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;our support form&lt;/a&gt; to contact us. When you do that, it verifies that you have access to the account and lets us know the login email address. For some things, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to authenticate you. Some questions we can just answer. But we can&amp;rsquo;t share account, payment, or domain ownership information without authentication (for both security and privacy reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your problem is that you&amp;rsquo;re not able to log in though, sending us an authenticated request is nearly impossible. In these situations, we have to do an account holder authentication. We&amp;rsquo;ll need documentation that matches what we have on record to prove your identity, such as something with your name and contact details, or possibly your credit card holder name, card type, number, etc. for a billing issue, depending on the situation. (Once we&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed who you are, we don&amp;rsquo;t keep or use that documentation for anything else.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take our customers&amp;rsquo; account security very seriously, and without sufficient proof, we&amp;rsquo;re not going to give anyone access to an account. We know that can be frustrating and take extra time, but remember, your personal and financial information and intellectual property are in your account. You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; us to be sticklers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;About your domain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed who you are, we now need to know which domain we need to look at (you&amp;rsquo;d be amazed how often people forget to mention that part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us find the domain faster, there are a few things to be mindful of. Is the problem with the .COM or .CO version? Are you sure it&amp;rsquo;s registered with us? If it expired &amp;ldquo;a while ago&amp;rdquo;, was that a couple of months, or a couple of years? Also, if you have more than one account with us, mentioning that is helpful, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure of a detail listed above, logging in to your account to check can help. Or you can do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.domaintools.com/&#34;&gt;WHOIS lookup&lt;/a&gt; to see the domain&amp;rsquo;s registration information in many cases. (Don&amp;rsquo;t stress out too much though, if you forget a bit of information, we&amp;rsquo;re pretty good at figuring domain stuff out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;About the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we know which domain we&amp;rsquo;re looking at, the goal is for you to be like a detective when you tell us about the problem. Obviously we don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to know everything (that&amp;rsquo;s our job), but try to give us all the information you can. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My website was working this morning, and now it isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before it stopped working, I made X changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things stopped working right after setting up new DNS records or nameservers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had trouble paying for a renewal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more details we have, the faster we can hunt down and sort out the issue for you. As mentioned, it&amp;rsquo;s okay if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s wrong. We just need to know what you wanted (or didn&amp;rsquo;t want) to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/&#34;&gt;We also have a comprehensive help centre to assist you as well.&lt;/a&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s a good chance your issue or question is covered there. And if your problem is new, we&amp;rsquo;ll probably use the experience to add more articles to explain it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, there are limits to what we can fix. Here are some things we can&amp;rsquo;t do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t do anything with domains registered at other registrars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t edit DNS records when your hosting is with a different provider. (We don&amp;rsquo;t have access to that account even if your domain is registered with us.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t make changes in your accounts on other platforms or services, like website or email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these situations, we can ask a few questions and maybe make a recommendation, but usually we&amp;rsquo;ll advise contacting their support for a more definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;It&#39;ll work, don&#39;t worry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we can answer questions or fix things right away. Sure, it can take a little bit of time for settings to propagate, services to start working, or new sites to come online, but for the most part, things go pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally though, the problem is outside of our system, like an issue with a ccTLD registry where they need to update or fix something on their end. We do our best to communicate with them (and you) to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, but cases like that can take more time than we&amp;rsquo;d like – sometimes even a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as site update requests and feedback go, we read every message. After talking things over with the team, suggestions either get added to our update queue, get fixed or built right away (usually critical issues or easy things to accomplish), or just aren&amp;rsquo;t possible (yet&amp;hellip; we love hearing pie-in-the-sky ideas). We&amp;rsquo;re always listening though, and considering how we can make our service better for customers, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to send us a message&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Struggling to update your site? Maybe it&#39;s time to do something different with your domain name</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it – most people who have their own website struggle to keep it up-to-date and post new content regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably started out with the best of intentions, even posted for months or years religiously, but now it seems like a chore to get anything up. Perhaps your site doesn’t reflect you any longer, or you&amp;rsquo;ve simply said everything you had to say about a topic. Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to a more social writing platform like Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now is, what should you do with your domain name? Having a dormant site isn&amp;rsquo;t doing you much good, but getting rid of a domain that has real brand equity is a total waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, unlike a username on a social platform, you can do lots of things with a domain name – it can go anywhere and become just about anything. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Use the domain for email only&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Forward your domain somewhere else&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Set up a basic one-page site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Try getting into writing again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;Change direction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Use the domain for email only&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a blog for years which I shut down recently because I wanted to focus more on personal connections in real life. It was such a huge relief to not feel guilty about not posting any longer. But instead of completely shutting the name down, it dawned on me that it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly okay to use my personal domain just for email. Nobody says there needs to be a website attached to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your own domain for email has some big advantages over the free offerings you can get from Gmail, iCloud, etc. The first of which is the perceived professionalism a custom domain provides. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in a situation where you&amp;rsquo;re exchanging email addresses with a client (or potential client), having your own brand attached makes it seem like you&amp;rsquo;re taking yourself seriously. It takes five minutes for anyone to get a Gmail address – they&amp;rsquo;re completely generic – but a custom email address means you&amp;rsquo;ve put a bit of effort in (even if our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/&#34;&gt;simplified email installations&lt;/a&gt; make it really easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your own domain for email also gives you infinite portability. If you don’t like Gmail anymore, you can’t just switch to another service and keep your username@gmail.com address. However, with your own domain name you can exactly do that. Want to move from one email hosting provider to another while keeping the same address? Simply change the DNS settings of your domain and voilà.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Forward your domain somewhere else&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you maintain any active online profiles, &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1418597-how-do-i-set-up-domain-forwarding-&#34;&gt;forwarding your domain&lt;/a&gt; to the one reflecting you most is an easy way to show people where they can find you and what you’re passionate about. And best of all, forwarding domains is free of charge with most domain registrars and hosting companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, designers could forward their domain to Dribbble and show off their latest work, or developers to GitHub for their latest contributions to Open Source projects. Twitter is also an obvious choice if you&amp;rsquo;re still into it. Any public web address works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main advantages with redirecting your domain to another profile is the same as for email again: portability! Your interest in Twitter is fading away? Forward it to another location instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Set up a basic one-page site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Struggling to update your own blog doesn’t necessarily mean you&amp;rsquo;ve stopped posting everywhere else. So why not have a single website pointing to your tweets, Instagram photos, and Facebook profile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a one-pager from services like &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.me&#34;&gt;about.me&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://branded.me&#34;&gt;branded.me&lt;/a&gt;, you don’t have to do anything to update your website regularly. Just set it up once, write a short bio, and link to your other online profiles. Many platforms will even pull in your content from around the internet so parts of your website will update automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Try getting into writing again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds easier than it really is, but getting into a healthy writing habit is key when trying to get out of a writing funk. Start small with just a few minutes per day, e.g. by writing a few tweet-like short fictional status updates and expand from there. Don’t worry about publishing what you’ve written – all that matters is that you get back into the routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve established the habit, start thinking of posting to your blog again. Just make sure you focus on the writing and not other details like layouts and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting&#34;&gt;blog hosting platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Also, before you get yourself into another block, accept that it&amp;rsquo;s ok to post infrequently. There&amp;rsquo;s no rule saying you need to publish daily, or even twice a week. It’s fine only to publish something once a month or twice a year. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself and only work on your biggest ideas that have the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;Change direction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just need a fresh start. Last year, when I was searching for options to post shorter status updates on my own domain instead of Twitter or Facebook, I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://withknown.com&#34;&gt;Known&lt;/a&gt; platform. Their software allows you to post Twitter-like status updates, long-form writing, images, and check-ins to your site first before sending them to connected services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known helped me to think of my site as a place where I can post everything without the constraints of a blog. I didn’t feel like posting longer articles all the time, which was why my previous blog stagnated and ultimately died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you want is share a quick thought, photo, or location with the world. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s Tumblr, but it’s just another free service owned by a large internet company (in trouble). With Known, it felt the same as posting to Twitter and Facebook, but on my own domain. That’s a subtle but very important difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Known platform is just one example how you could change direction with your blog. Invest some time in exploring your options and how you could change your workflows, software, or the topics you cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever of the options you choose or come up with your own, I see owning a domain name as a life-long investment. The services you use with it will change over time. You will evolve over time. However, if you pick the right domain, it can stay with you for a very, very long time and in different reincarnations. Don’t give up on it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why domain prices can vary among registrars</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why some registrars may be able to offer lower prices for domain registrations. Some ccTLDs and new gTLDs can be quite expensive because the registries can set their own pricing. So we understand that your budget can be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Loss leader pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When domain prices are set very low, especially significantly lower than many other registrars, that&amp;rsquo;s typically what&amp;rsquo;s known as a &amp;ldquo;loss leader&amp;rdquo;. The price the customer pays to register the domain is often less than the price the registrar pays the registry for it. They aren&amp;rsquo;t making money on that registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sales tactic to encourage registration of lots of domains of that type. However, the registration price is very rarely the permanent price for the domain. It&amp;rsquo;s also sometimes because some registrars make their money selling a WHOIS privacy service or other value-adds. (Our WHOIS privacy service is free.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on upselling and our thoughts about it, have a look at this article: &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/no-upselling-tactics-to-be-found-here.html&#34;&gt;No Upselling Tactics To Be Found Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend checking before registering a domain what the annual renewal price will be. It is typically much higher than the registration price. Registrars are well within their rights to change the price this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Volume pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason is volume. There are a few very large registrars that can negotiate volume discounts with registries because they manage millions of domains. This generates big profits for registries. So the big registrars can negotiate lower base pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the big registrars also have special marketing agreements with the new domain registries. That means they get cash back from the source registry for promoting a specific domain type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the pricing may remain fairly low, but you&amp;rsquo;re also getting the experience of doing business with big companies, which can sometimes be a bit bureaucratic or impersonal&amp;hellip; and put their focus more on sales and marketing than helping customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other sources of revenue (like customers&amp;hellip;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the common adage that if you&amp;rsquo;re not paying for something, then &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the product. Companies need to make money to survive. If they&amp;rsquo;re not making much money selling domains (or are even losing money doing that), they need to make up profits elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some do that by using your data or selling your customer information. They get paid by their partners for this vetted information, and it&amp;rsquo;s basically a condition of your customer agreement with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building a sustainable business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started iwantmyname with really clear and strong ideas of what kind of company we wanted to build. And a lot of that had to do with ways we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; want to run our businesses. (Even if the practices were common in the industry.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We list our beliefs and policy information &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;on our About page&lt;/a&gt;, and we stand by it. We believe it&amp;rsquo;s the best way to build a sustainable company that customers &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to do business with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t believe you can measure yourself or company successful if it results in &amp;ldquo;human roadkill&amp;rdquo; on that road to success. You&amp;rsquo;re in business because your customers are willing to do business with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarily, your business&amp;rsquo; existence and growth relies on your team. We&amp;rsquo;ve grown slowly and carefully, and have a lot of experience and deep knowledge of our industry. We believe that&amp;rsquo;s the best way to serve our customers. We haven&amp;rsquo;t outsourced support to places where we can amass lots of cheap–but low-skilled–labour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Be informed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always recommend doing your research. If domains seem &amp;ldquo;too good to be true&amp;rdquo; cheap, they very well might be. And if domains are a bit more expensive sometimes, see what that means in terms of the renewal pricing, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/about&#34;&gt;the company you&amp;rsquo;re doing business with&lt;/a&gt;, their policies, and other things that may be important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t and don&amp;rsquo;t do price matching. We do show current discounts on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;domains pricing page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer&#34;&gt;our transfers page&lt;/a&gt;, and on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer&#34;&gt;monthly discounts page&lt;/a&gt;. And we do our best to pass discounts and price reductions along to you whenever we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about pricing or related issues, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;just let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>We&#39;ve got your back with DNSSEC</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname, we consider making it easy for you to control and own your online identity as one of our core principles. Hell, it&amp;rsquo;s in the branding. But what happens after that? Are we sure every time someone tries to connect to your identity, they&amp;rsquo;re actually connecting with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do that now with DNSSEC and DS records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to set this up is if your Nameserver provider supports DNSSEC (like Cloudflare, pictured below). Just enable it there, then grab your DS record to use with your domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/media/2016-02-01-dnssec.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cloudflare interface&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our site, copy the relevant bits, which is everything &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;domain&gt; 3600 IN DS&lt;/strong&gt;, of the DS record to the DS record page in your domain admin (you can find that at &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/domains/dnssec/&#34;&gt;https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/domains/dnssec/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;domain name in question&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/media/2016-02-01-iwantmyname-dnssec.png&#34; alt=&#34;iwantmyname interface&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re done, &lt;em&gt;the internet&lt;/em&gt; will start double checking that the server people are connecting to is actually yours. Thus making sure that you and your name are synonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, an in-depth explanation of what DNSSEC is (and why you might want it) can be found on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/dnssec-an-introduction/&#34;&gt;CloudFlare blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Now hiring: Customer support scholar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone -- We&amp;rsquo;ve had an amazing and overwhelming response. Over 300 applicants! So we&amp;rsquo;re booking interviews at this point and are no longer accepting further applications. Thanks so much for all your interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s break this down. We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a very patient person to help our global audience do great things with domains. You&amp;rsquo;ll help them register domains, you&amp;rsquo;ll help them with billing issues, you&amp;rsquo;ll help them use their domains, and you might even help them with an idea or two. Whatever they need, you&amp;rsquo;ll be there to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;scholar&amp;rdquo; bit wasn&amp;rsquo;t just for fun though. To be great at this job, you have to want to learn. About domain names, our processes, our systems, and how people use them. The learning never stops, and the right person will love soaking it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of our job openings, this job is for people in and around our timezone (we&amp;rsquo;re in Wellington, NZ). We could possibly make an exception for the right person elsewhere, but you must be available during New Zealand, Australian, or Asian business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of the skills we&amp;rsquo;re looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You absolutely have to have plus plus English language writing skills. You’ll be writing a lot, and English is our business communication language. (If you happen to speak/write another language, it would certainly be a bonus.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must like people (like, actually like them). No matter how frustrated the customer, you need to be able to clearly and completely solve problems without becoming (noticeably) impatient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity. You don’t have to be the world’s foremost domains expert to work here, but a little curiosity will go a long way in solving problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, some knowledge of domains, DNS, and the internet would be advantageous. We&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching you a ton, but we&amp;rsquo;d rather not start with &amp;ldquo;this is what a Nameserver is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is key - you need to be able to work without supervision. There will almost always be a someone to help you through problems (especially in the beginning), but for the most part, you need to be able to solve problems on your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this is the job for you, send a witty email with a quick rundown of relevant work history to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jobs@ideegeo.com&#34;&gt;jobs@ideegeo.com&lt;/a&gt;. (Please don&amp;rsquo;t send any multi-page resumes&amp;hellip; brevity is a skill we admire.)&lt;/p&gt;
