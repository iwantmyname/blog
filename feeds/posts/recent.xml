				<title>On the sad stagnation of Virb</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/blog/what-happened-to-virb-after-godaddy-acquired-it&quot;&gt;From Steve Benjamins - Site Builder Report:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture at Virb began to shift after the GoDaddy acquisition. There were now new bosses and new goals— but not ones that aligned with Virb’s original vision. The 4 original Virb team members decided it was time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was clear to me that our new leadership wanted to extract as much money from our customers as possible.” Ryan Clark, Virb’s Product Manager and Creative Director at the time says. “Our new directive was simple: revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the Virb team was denied any resources. After losing the 4 original Virb team members Clark notes, “All of my requests to fill the positions disappeared in the ether of the acquisition. It seemed clear to me that GoDaddy had no intention of backing up their new goals for us with the resources to actually achieve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t so much an indictment of GoDaddy, as they clearly acquired Media Temple to better compete in the web hosting game (Virb just happened to be part of the deal), but it&amp;#39;s sad to see a once-promising platform slow to a grind. As a writer who frequently uses all-in-one platforms to get ideas on the web, I&amp;#39;ve primarily moved on to Squarespace. It&amp;#39;s fast enough, beautiful, and best of all, dead simple to use. Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll see other hosted, all-in-one solutions take up the torch though—competition in the space is what drives innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the future of Virb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallgren speculates that GoDaddy will let Virb “die a slow death and collect the money being made on it in the meantime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this most effects the 20,000 customers who still rely on Virb to provide a stable, contemporary website— unfortunately, it’s not clear how stable that future is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>Mike Carson compiles the 1457 most popular .io domains</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/&quot;&gt;From Mike Carson:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly one year ago today I created a list of the top .io domains. At that time there were only 676 .io domains in the top 1 million sites in the world (from Alexa). In one year that number has more than doubled to 1457.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little sample (the top 10):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github.io - rank 307&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;codepen.io - rank 1372&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soup.io - rank 3161&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intercom.io - rank 3375&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;t411.io - rank 3477&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meduza.io - rank 3546&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keywordtool.io - rank 3637&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;popcorntime.io - rank 4816&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spring.io - rank 5566&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;greenhouse.io - rank 6263&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short lists are interesting. Massive lists are amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Usability is something we should all be striving for</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://melodykramer.github.io/how-betty-who-is-89-gets-her-news/&quot;&gt;From Melody Kramer:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we drank tea, I watched Betty read articles on her iPad. Her Internet was really slow. She kept accidentally clicking on the ads, or on parts of the story that she didn’t mean to click on. And she was getting a bit frustrated and worried — that by clicking on something, she was going to install malware or not be able to return to her story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 13 million people between the ages of 75 and 84 in the US. There are 5 million between the ages of 85 and 94. (census) That population will grow. At some point, it will be composed of digital natives but that’s a while away. In the interim, are there better ways to design websites for this population? Are there better ways to design the news for them? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any good web entity, we&amp;#39;re always planning for the next evolution of our website. Whether we like it or not, trends change, platforms that were built for one thing get weighed down by incremental additions, and new technologies emerge (like responsive design) that change how sites move through the world. Those things are always moving targets that need to be addressed, but one factor that cannot be overlooked, no matter when your design/redesign occurs, is usability. At the end of the day, the single most important thing you can offer is an easy path from idea to completion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a good example of where the internet is going. After I wrote our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/what-should-the-internet-do-with-money.html&quot;&gt;post about .money&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking through various finance websites. What I found didn&amp;#39;t really surprise me, but it&amp;#39;s worth noting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-11-fidelity-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fidelity homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Fidelity&amp;#39;s homepage. As you can see, it&amp;#39;s packed with information, but if your goal is to start an account (which, I&amp;#39;d argue, should be the goal in a logged-out state) , you have a lot to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-11-wealthfront-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wealthfront homepage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum is Wealthfront, an investment startup that puts usability first. Big buttons. Clear calls to action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could certainly make the argument that Fidelity&amp;#39;s website is more immediately useful, strictly from a knowledge-density perspective, but we&amp;#39;re heading in a direction, as a society, where screens are rapidly shrinking in size.  Apple recently announced their new 12&amp;quot; Macbook, which is their most technologically advanced laptop to date (not to be confused with fastest), and the only reason the screen is as big as it is is because they didn&amp;#39;t want the keyboard to be any smaller. There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; come a day, and it may come faster than we think, where an iPad/phablet-type device will be the primary device for many, and then what? Will the Fidelity content-density model hold up? Are we just going to sit around while our aging population is designed off these unusable platforms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/rant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just something to think about when you&amp;#39;re starting your next design/redesign process.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What should the internet do with its new .money?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-10-money-bowtie.png&quot; alt=&quot;Money bowtie&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is a hard thing for a lot of people to talk about, so let&amp;#39;s shift the focus a bit by putting a &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; in front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money = aghhhhhhh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.money = awesome!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what should the people of the internet do with their new .money (domains... &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-money&quot;&gt;.money&lt;/a&gt; goes live tomorrow)? Let me count the ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Start the world&amp;#39;s most trusted Bitcoin blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a brilliant financier who rode Bitcoins from around $200 to nearly $1,000, then back down to $200, I can safely say that I don&amp;#39;t know right from left when it comes to Bitcoin valuations. But you know who else doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about Bitcoin valuations? The rest of the internet. And if I know anything, it&amp;#39;s that general confusion means there&amp;#39;s a gap in the market, just waiting to be filled. And really, using .money for a digital publication about digital money is magic in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Forget Bitcoins... start your own digital currency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beyond my scope, but there have to be a few iwantmynamers out there with cryptocurrency running through their veins. Seriously, if someone can build a currency around the doge meme, I think we (as in you and your friends) can band together to make something better. Just don&amp;#39;t forget the .money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Start a finance blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, if your finance blog gets big, you might have to buy (and sometimes wear) a suit or two, but that&amp;#39;s the price you have to pay when you&amp;#39;re a big time analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Become a &amp;quot;startup finance expert&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of analysts, I feel like startup financing is having a bit of a PR issue these days. I read all the time about the overabundance of money flowing through places like Silicon Valley, but I rarely read about analysts saying the opposite. Going back to my gap-that-needs-to-be-filled theory, I think there&amp;#39;s a big opportunity for someone to start an expert site telling the world that tech startups need more cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe your site could be about bootstrapped companies like iwantmyname... your call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Make your financial institution more &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; focused&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. Take your average bank, I&amp;#39;ll go with Wells Fargo for this example.  The website for Wells Fargo is wellsfargo.com—.com meaning commercial. What this says to me is that Wells Fargo is a commercial entity that wants to make money. But I don&amp;#39;t put money in the bank for them to make money, I do it so &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can make money. So why not swap the bank&amp;#39;s .com with .money and give people a little something to aspire to? wellsfargo.money sounds like a bank I could get on board with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Give your personal brand a makeover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for a little personal brand boost? Change your personal website to &lt;code&gt;YOURNAME.money&lt;/code&gt;. You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Coupon site?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the internet is in desperate need of something, it&amp;#39;s definitely more coupon sites. Retail coupon sites, online services coupon sites, coupon sites for coupon sites—the possibilities are endless! &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New feature alert - domain hacks in search</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-05-domain-hack.png&quot; alt=&quot;work trip&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of domains, naming is a bit like an architecture project. The domain name has to stand on its own, make sense to those who use it, and be conventional enough to attract all types of potential guests. A standard domain name is much like a standard building—the outside can be nice, but it&amp;#39;s really what&amp;#39;s inside that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html&quot;&gt;domain hacks&lt;/a&gt; are a bit different. They&amp;#39;re the circular buildings with no conventional walls, the tiny houses that don&amp;#39;t make sense to most, the underground mud huts that only the adventurous flock to. A domain hack will likely never be the primary domain of a multinational corporation, but for those who appreciate cultural oddities, there&amp;#39;s simply nothing better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the deal. In our domain search, when you type in a word or brand, a single domain hack will now appear as the second result (if one is able to be made). It&amp;#39;s nothing Earth-shattering—just a little something for your Thursday afternoon/Friday morning (depending on what side of the international date line you&amp;#39;re on) pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Price increase alert for .INFO and .MU</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Heads up, folks. We&amp;#39;re not fond of domain extension price increases, but we have two to announce, both of which affect the registration and renewal costs for the domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;May 1, 2015 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information&quot;&gt;.INFO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$15.50 to $16.50 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;€11.90 to €12.90 EUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£10.90 to £11.50 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$19 to $19.90 AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;April 1, 2015 - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mu-mauritian-domain-name-registration-for-mauritius&quot;&gt;.MU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$99 to $119 USD &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;€89 to €129 EUR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$159 to $169 NZD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£78 to £89 GBP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$119 to $169 AUD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the price increases, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/support&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Trustworthiness as a factor in Google rankings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530102.600-google-wants-to-rank-websites-based-on-facts-not-links.html#.VPSuQUIylBW&quot;&gt;From Hal Hodson - New Scientist:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google research team is adapting that model to measure the trustworthiness of a page, rather than its reputation across the web. Instead of counting incoming links, the system – which is not yet live – counts the number of incorrect facts within a page. &amp;quot;A source that has few false facts is considered to be trustworthy,&amp;quot; says the team (arxiv.org/abs/1502.03519v1). The score they compute for each page is its Knowledge-Based Trust score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software works by tapping into the Knowledge Vault, the vast store of facts that Google has pulled off the internet. Facts the web unanimously agrees on are considered a reasonable proxy for truth. Web pages that contain contradictory information are bumped down the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much time and effort these days goes into search engine optimization (SEO), but every time I see an article like this, I see a day in the far-off future where all the &amp;quot;tips and tricks&amp;quot; will be replaced by variations of a single question—is your website helping the world or hurting it?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Leonard Nimoy&#39;s final tweet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/27/8121021/leonard-nimoy-spock-live-long-and-prosper&quot;&gt;From Bryan Bishop - The Verge:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it should go without saying that the sense of someone we get from their acting and public appearances often bears little resemblance to who they actually are. But what is undeniable is the emotional impact their work has on us. And for the millions of people, like myself, that grew up with Leonard Nimoy, those are the memories that we will carry with us throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a sentiment that Nimoy himself reflected upon on Twitter this past Sunday, in his very last post. &amp;quot;A life is like a garden,&amp;quot; he wrote. &amp;quot;Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Domain hacks and the new generic top-level domains</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain hacks aren&amp;#39;t for the feint of heart. They disrupt the status quo of website naming, they&amp;#39;re often hard to say out loud, and countless online guides have been written warning people not to get too clever with their domain names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...I&amp;#39;m just going to come out and say it...I love a good domain hack. They&amp;#39;re counterculture without being overly brazen and they stick in my head forever (despite being hard to say sometimes). And with hundreds of new domain extensions to choose from with the launch of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&quot;&gt;generic top-level domains (gTLDs)&lt;/a&gt;, the domain hack possibilities are practically endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into it, let&amp;#39;s set a working definition for what a domain hack is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain hack - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or brand names out of domain names, like bit.ly (brand name) or iwantmyna.me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now clearly, with these new gTLDs running around, the definition of domain hack is in a bit of flux. Is a domain like chess.club a domain hack? I&amp;#39;d argue that it&amp;#39;s not, unless your brand name is ChessClub. If every gTLD that makes a phrase is considered a domain hack, then the term itself has been diluted beyond comprehension. We just can&amp;#39;t have that! So... no phrases for domain hacks, just words and brand names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these boundaries in mind, let&amp;#39;s find some good gTLD domain hack possibilities (I&amp;#39;m not checking each for availability... this is really just to get your mind going).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ra.bid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specifi.city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ac.company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dis.credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;super.fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bl.ink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never.land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hyper.link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;de.parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bo.red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at.tax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;net.work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many good options! Again, domain hacks are definitely for the feint of heart, but if you find yourself hopelessly attracted to clever domain/TLD combinations, we&amp;#39;re right in the middle of a domain hack renaissance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you need any help finding a killer domain hack, look no further than the trusty &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordfind.com/#words&quot;&gt;Scrabble Word Finder&lt;/a&gt; (under advanced options, you can specifically ask for words that end with any combination of letters). Also, if you have a specific word in mind, our friends over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainr.com&quot;&gt;Domainr&lt;/a&gt; have the perfect domain search for the task—it takes any word you put in and shoots back a handful of awesome options, including any combination of domain hacks available (I typed in bored and got back bo.red &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bo.re/d... both taken already, but still amazing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy domain hacking!&lt;/p&gt;
