				<title>Getting the right logo for your website</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands upon thousands of websites are created every day. New brands. New blogs. Social platforms, online portfolios, e-commerce sites. And really, there&amp;rsquo;s very little in common amongst the sites. Some will be responsive, some will have traditional layouts, some will have non-traditional layouts—but nearly all of them will have a logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo. It&amp;rsquo;s the first thing people see when they visit your site, but it&amp;rsquo;s often the last thing people think about when starting out. So let&amp;rsquo;s unlock some of the mystery behind the logo building process and figure out how you can get a logo you&amp;rsquo;ll be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-5&#34;&gt;What to look for when choosing from options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Why a logo is important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/26/vital-tips-for-effective-logo-design/&#34;&gt;From Jacob Cass, Smashing Magazine: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what a logo is, we first must understand what the main purpose of logos is. The design process must aim to make the logo immediately recognizable, inspiring trust, admiration, loyalty and an implied superiority. The logo is one aspect of a company’s commercial brand or economic entity, and its shapes, colors, fonts, and images usually are strikingly different from other logo in the same market niche. Logos are used to identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Rand, one of the world’s greatest designers states that “a logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. A logo does not sell (directly), it identifies. A logo is rarely a description of a business. A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack that a bit. The logo, as stated above, is your brand&amp;rsquo;s signature. That brand could be you and your personal thoughts (a personal blog), a collection of many thoughts (a company website or group blog), or just a digital space for your physical entity (like a menu/information site for a restaurant)—no matter what it is, it&amp;rsquo;s your logo that will be front and center on your site (or maybe in the top left). And as Paul Rand says, your logo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a description of your business—it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to tell an epic at first glance—but it should give some meaning to what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. Does your logo &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671067/the-story-behind-the-famous-fedex-logo-and-why-it-works&#34;&gt;inspire motion&lt;/a&gt;? Whimsy? A rigid but formidable structure? Or the worst, a trend that died off years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things matter. Maybe not as much as the quality of whatever you&amp;rsquo;re building, but people do notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;How a logo fits into your branding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a logo matters most is when it comes to branding, and branding is &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; these days. Just think about it—instead of just seeing logos on physical goods and locations, then on the occasional website, you now see logos on Twitter handles, Facebook posts, Instagram shots, app icons, and emails. Branding is all over the internet, and if your logo doesn&amp;rsquo;t look good in any space, on any size, your brand is probably missing the mark (and giving your discerning customers a bad taste in their mouths).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little nugget from someone who was consistently ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ template &amp;ldquo;youtube&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;xb8idEf-Iak&amp;rdquo; }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while a company has a logo that&amp;rsquo;s a little jewel, a symbol, that can be used independently of the logotype. At Apple we had such a symbol, as a matter of fact, at Apple, the symbol was the name of the company. It was a thing that had the same name as the company—an apple. Our challenge was that it usually takes ten years and a hundred million dollars to associate a symbol with the name of the company. Our challenge was, how can we have a little jewel that we could use without the name to put on the product without spending ten years and a hundred million dollars to make that association in a customer&amp;rsquo;s mind. And Paul solved that by making a little jewel that contained in it the name of the company. And I think he really approached it as a problem that needed to be solved, rather than an artistic challenge for his own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, that little jewel is so critical—it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to fit in your square Twitter profile pic. It&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to fit cleanly on a mobile site without hogging too much screen real estate. And if you happen to see that logo in the wild, it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to give your potential customers an instant reminder of what you&amp;rsquo;re all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/what-makes-the-best-logos-so-good-2014-4&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit from Richard Feloni of Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; on how logos are changing because people are just now realizing the need for adaptability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tackling a branding project, Mathews differentiates between the &amp;ldquo;true and new.&amp;rdquo; She says a logo needs to be &amp;ldquo;true,&amp;rdquo; in the sense that it should not be fundamentally tied to a trend, the &amp;ldquo;new.&amp;rdquo; The trendiness is more appropriate in supporting elements of branding, like store experiences or website interfaces. That said, a logo should be fundamentally sound but also be adaptable to the ways it will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Logos used to have to be recognizable down to the size that they would be represented on a business card. Now they have to work at much smaller sizes, because they&amp;rsquo;ll be seen on mobile screens,&amp;rdquo; Mathews said. That&amp;rsquo;s actually the reason why so many logos have become &amp;ldquo;flatter,&amp;rdquo; in the sense that they&amp;rsquo;ve been stripped of techniques like shadowing that add a dimension of depth or movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;What it takes to design a logo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that adaptability in mind, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know what it takes to create a logo that works. Aaron Draplin, one of the most well-known logo designers today, made a great video on his process, and a bit of the thinking that goes behind logo creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{{ template &amp;ldquo;vimeo&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;113751583&amp;rdquo; }}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to design that logo, and just have it floating on this PDF, and you&amp;rsquo;re sort of drunk on white space and negative space and just floating, but rarely will you see it that way. The way you see it will be on some stupid little Instagram in the corner, or on a guy&amp;rsquo;s business card, or embroidered on his sweatshirt or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a rush job from one of the better designers out there, but if you want a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; logo, it&amp;rsquo;s probably going to take a bit of time, some honest critical thinking, and possibly a bit of money. (In short, you should be wary of any company offering you a quick logo for cheap.) You might end up getting something wonderful, but most likely you&amp;rsquo;re going to get something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture the soul of your brand, and will probably look dated in a couple of years.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Logo options for different budgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and effort aside, does it cost thousands, or millions, of dollars to get a good logo? Nope. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/4140/the-cost-of-a-logo&#34;&gt;From HUH., in an article titled &amp;ldquo;The Cost Of A Logo&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, oil giant BP commissioned creative agency Landor Associates, advertising agency Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather and the PR consultants Ogilvy PR to replace their &amp;ldquo;Green Shield&amp;rdquo; logo with the current Helios symbol and create a surrounding identity and campaign. Designed in a green and yellow sunflower pattern, the logo represents energy in its many forms and comes with the tagline &amp;ldquo;Beyond Petroleum&amp;rdquo;. The cost of this re-branding procedure? A mere $211 million USD…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, Google went a different route:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite arguably being the most recognisable logo in the Western world, the Google logo cost the Internet company exactly $0 to create. It was actually designed in 1998 by co-founder Sergey Brin and, although it&amp;rsquo;s obviously been tuned up a little since then, the main elements still remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good logos can come from anywhere, and can be made by anyone. Expectations are important though. While Google did indeed create an iconic logo on the cheap, the company started in the early days of the internet when sites typically looked terrible. User expectations of website designs were initially quite low, and the Google logo has been polished, repolished, and probably repolished again between then and now to make up for it. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to go the route of creating your own logo or going with something inexpensive, don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck. Your brand is always evolving, and your logo can, and should, evolve with it (unless you strike gold with a cheap logo like Nike or Coca-Cola).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few directions you could go when looking to get a logo built:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some design skills? Pull up Adobe Illustrator, or your app of choice, and start creating. (You can also use free tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://squarespace.com/logo&#34;&gt;Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s logo creator&lt;/a&gt;, but know that your options will be limited.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know a designer? Figure out a budget and ask if they&amp;rsquo;ll help you out. (A budget is important, even if it&amp;rsquo;s small&amp;hellip; if you value someone&amp;rsquo;s work, you should pay them.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try a site like &lt;a href=&#34;http://99designs.com&#34;&gt;99designs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design/creative-logo-design/#layout=auto&amp;amp;page=1&#34;&gt;Fiverr&lt;/a&gt;. If anything, getting an inexpensive logo made will set you on the right track, giving you something you can evolve as your brand does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a local branding shop. Anyone good will charge $100+/hr (rough estimate), but with a branding shop, you&amp;rsquo;ll get someone who will give your brand some real attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you get, there is one important thing to be mindful of. Be consistent. Sure, you can make changes to your logo over time, but you need to be consistent with it across the board. Your site logo needs to pair with your Twitter logo, and your font can&amp;rsquo;t be Helvetica in one place, and then Arial on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a designer&amp;rsquo;s worst nightmare, &lt;a href=&#34;http://logopsych.com/2013/01/13/small-business-logo-commitment/#more-60&#34;&gt;from Logo Psych:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew he probably didn’t have much of a budget to hire me (or anyone else) to design a logo from scratch so I did the best I could and offered him some free advice. I told him NOT to do what the previous owners of Dexter’s did. Dexter’s had a terrible brand consistency problem. Their front sign, side sign, business cards and website all displayed a different style of what might be called Dexter’s logo. Their card had a silhouette of a coffee mug with the handle turned into a Helvetica D with the rest of the word following in Helvetica. It wasn’t great, but not too terrible either. It could have been an effective logo if they’d just had a sense of COMMITMENT to that single logo. Their front signage had their name in something similar to Baskerville, a serifed “classic” typeface. The sign on the side of the building was something different, and their website logo I believe was set in Times New Roman. Absolutely no consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you go with, make sure you use your logo consistently. It matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5&#34;&gt;What to look for when choosing from options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;rsquo;re going with someone like Paul Rand, who famously only provided a single logo option to his clients, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be presented with a few variations. How do you choose between them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32495854&#34;&gt;from Peter Shadbolt, BBC:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are presented with a design for your company logo that is immediately likeable and resonates with your values, you might be wise to take a long hard look at it, bin it, and start again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the opinion of Sagi Haviv, partner at New York graphic design firm Chermayeff &amp;amp; Geismer &amp;amp; Haviv (CGH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s never love at first sight,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;A good logo, a good trademark, gains meaning and power over time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you slide into melancholy, the key thing to know is that picking the right logo takes time. Just like when choosing a house, a car, or a pair of jeans, you have to put stock into all the options. You might love something immediately, but give every option some thought, and really try to see the value in everything you&amp;rsquo;re given. Subtlety can take time to digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a thought-starter, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidairey.com/what-makes-a-good-logo/&#34;&gt;David Airey, on the important design elements of brand identities:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend Lee Newham taught me about five important design elements when it comes to brand identities. Iconic logos are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective without colour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable i.e. work when just an inch in size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant to the industry in question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most things in life, just know that there&amp;rsquo;s never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; going to be a perfect option. If you&amp;rsquo;re an observant human, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably be able to find fault in anything. But as Paul Rand said at the beginning &amp;ldquo;a logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around.&amp;rdquo; A great logo won&amp;rsquo;t make a bad brand good, and a bad logo can always be made better, as long as the brand can prop it up. Be brave! Make a decision and stick with it (for a while at least)! And don&amp;rsquo;t stagnate. Stagnation is probably the worst thing for your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting started with iwantmyname</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this guide is to get you started on iwantmyname, assuming you have no background in domain registration or starting up a website. We&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep things as need-to-know as possible, so if you&amp;rsquo;re easily distracted, or just don&amp;rsquo;t like your intro guides seeming like college courses, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;Registering your first domain name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Making sure your information is secure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Putting your domain name to work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;Registering your first domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-city-houses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Crowded Houses&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When registering your first domain name, try to think of it as a house just waiting to be constructed. In your mind, you probably have a good idea what you want your house to look like, but first, you need to figure out where to put it. That&amp;rsquo;s where TLDs (top-level domain) come in. The TLD is the part of your domain name after the dot—COM is the TLD for iwantmyname.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this world of domain names, your name is the house, and the TLD, the part after the dot, is the city you want to build in. The most common TLD today is .COM, which a city unlike any other. It&amp;rsquo;s the most well known, which is great for memorability (and potentially, traffic), but it&amp;rsquo;s huge and crowded, so a lot of the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; (short/memorable) property was taken long ago. On the flip side, there are hundreds of other TLDs to choose from—you just need to find the best option that aligns with your brand or interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of all the types of TLDs we offer, broken into easy categories (or, just take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;all of them on a single page&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gTLDs (generic top-level domains) &amp;ndash; The basic definition of a gTLD is any domain extension that doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent a country or territory. .COM is a gTLD that stands for commercial. .NET stands for network. .ORG stands for organization. (Don&amp;rsquo;t get hung up on &amp;ldquo;original intent&amp;rdquo; though. You can use .NET, .ORG, .COM, or any of our other TLDs for any type of business you want you want.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions&#34;&gt;The new gTLDs&lt;/a&gt; (often called nTLDs, or new TLDs) &amp;ndash; Just recently, the internet was flooded with hundreds of new gTLDs (like .PIZZA, .DESIGN, and .PHOTOS) in an effort to alleviate some of the overcrowding issues .COM is having. So now, instead of calling your catering company YOURBRANDcatering.COM, you could go with YOURBRAND.CATERING.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) &amp;ndash; Unlike .COM, ccTLDs are assigned to countries. For example, New Zealand uses .NZ, Spain uses .ES, and Canada uses .CA. So if you&amp;rsquo;re running a restaurant in Belgium, you could use your local .BE ccTLD instead of the more global .COM, giving you a less crowded namespace to work with, and potentially a more local feel. You don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be from the country to use its ccTLD either (we&amp;rsquo;ll let you know if there are any weird registration quirks involved)—.CO and .IO (Columbia and Indian Ocean Territories, respectively) are so commonly used, they&amp;rsquo;re often considered gTLDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an idea of the name you want, head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com&#34;&gt;iwantmyname.com&lt;/a&gt; and type the domain into the big search box in the middle of the page (then hit enter, or click the big button).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a long list of your domain with every TLD we offer. If the one you want is available, just click on it and it&amp;rsquo;ll appear in your cart on the right side of the screen (if it&amp;rsquo;s not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-getting-the-right-domain-name-for-your-brand.html&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s the guide&lt;/a&gt; on what to do next). If that&amp;rsquo;s the only domain you want, next, click the button labeled &lt;strong&gt;Checkout&lt;/strong&gt;—otherwise, feel free to search for and add other domains to your order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-shop-cart.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shopping Cart&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next page, create your iwantmyname login information using your email address and a password (we recommend using a tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; for password management), then click &lt;strong&gt;Continue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;rsquo;re on the checkout page, which is far more important than you think. It&amp;rsquo;s all self-explanatory, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;super important&lt;/em&gt; to use accurate contact information. And yes, that means your real address, phone number, email address, etc. &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-ins-and-outs-of-whois-privacy-and-accurate-contact-information.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a good article&lt;/a&gt; on why it&amp;rsquo;s necessary, and how you can protect your information the right way using WHOIS privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Making sure your information is secure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-account-page.png&#34; alt=&#34;Account page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have your first domain name now, but before you do anything else, let&amp;rsquo;s secure your information—just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little checklist of things we recommend doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make sure your password is strong&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time you&amp;rsquo;ve been told to create a strong password, but it&amp;rsquo;s always a good thing to hear (like eating your vegetables). Your password can be whatever you want, but our general suggestion is not to use anything that could easily be found through a simple internet search. So no family names, pet names, important dates, job titles, or hobbies you&amp;rsquo;ve written about. Randomness and length are key—we recommend using something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; to make it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change your password, click &lt;strong&gt;Login &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Account&lt;/strong&gt; in the top navigation and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Use two-factor authentication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to be secure, we recommend using two-factor authentication (2FA). Our implementation through Authy forces you (or a potential hacker) to enter a randomly generated code after you enter your login information that is only viewable through the Authy app on your phone or laptop. The idea is that if your login information was compromised, the potential data thief would also have to have your phone (or computer, if you set it up that way) to complete the login process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add 2FA, click &lt;strong&gt;Login &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Account&lt;/strong&gt; in the top navigation. Note that we don&amp;rsquo;t have Google Authenticator implemented at this time, but we may add additional 2FA options in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Add WHOIS privacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHOIS privacy is a free service we offer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;all TLDs that support it&lt;/a&gt;. In short, ICANN (the entity that maintains the gTLD namespaces) and each entity running the ccTLDs have policies in place on what information needs to be made available to the public on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.icann.org&#34;&gt;WHOIS database&lt;/a&gt;. With our WHOIS privacy in place, your personal information that was required at registration gets replaced on the public database with our company information. So the spot that shows your address would instead show our company address. Pretty nifty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because each ccTLD is run by a separate entity though, please note that not every TLD supports WHOIS privacy. Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;big list of those that do support it&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you want to read up about the ins and outs of WHOIS privacy, &lt;a href=&#34;(https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-ins-and-outs-of-whois-privacy-and-accurate-contact-information.html&#34;&gt;this is a great place to start&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add WHOIS privacy to your domain name, click &lt;strong&gt;Domains&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then select the domain you want to add WHOIS privacy to, then click &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;enable privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s in the &lt;strong&gt;Domain Owner&lt;/strong&gt; row).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Putting your domain name to work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve registered your first domain and added all your privacy settings, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start actually using it. But before we get into &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to set things up, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what kinds of easy things you can do with your domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a website &amp;ndash; Probably the most common thing you can do with a domain is start a website. And these days, with amazing platforms like Squarespace, Big Cartel, and Tumblr, anyone can start a blog, e-commerce site, gallery page, online portfolio, forum, etc., etc. without knowing an ounce of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html&#34;&gt;Get a custom email address&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Ever see someone with an email address that doesn&amp;rsquo;t end in @gmail.com, @me.com, @hotmail.com, etc.? That was set up with a using a domain name like the one you just registered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/three-steps-to-get-the-most-from-your-custom-short-url-using-bitly-and-buffer.html&#34;&gt;Shorten your links&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; When you post a link to Twitter (or some other social platforms), it&amp;rsquo;s automatically shortened to give you more characters to work with. If you want to brand that link shortening though (we&amp;rsquo;re using iwnt.me), you can get a short domain name and use it with a link shortening service like Bitly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host a podcast? Start a forum? &amp;ndash; If you can think of it, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a platform or service out there to get you started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what you&amp;rsquo;re looking to accomplish, our recommendation is to start your search in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-app-marketplace.png&#34; alt=&#34;Marketplace&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever messed with domain names in the past, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across a fairly acronym-heavy setup process with DNS record types like A, CNAME, MX, etc. What we&amp;rsquo;ve done is created a system that helps you avoid needing to deal with all that—allowing you to choose platforms like Squarespace and Tumblr, then add them to your domain in a click (all the work is done for you in the background).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember here is that all the platforms in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services&#34;&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; are hosted platforms, meaning you can use them without needing to worry about hosting space on the side. Just add the platform, sign up for it on their end, and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a platform from the Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-add-tumblr.png&#34; alt=&#34;Add Tumblr&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally you&amp;rsquo;ll run into some additional information needed on platform setups (here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-adding-squarespace-to-your-domain.html&#34;&gt;Squarespace installation guide&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but most platforms are very straightforward. Here&amp;rsquo;s the process for Tumblr, as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re logged in, click &lt;strong&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Services&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a platform you want to add, then click &lt;strong&gt;Add Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt; on the next page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit the green &lt;strong&gt;Install Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you still need to sign up for your desired platform on their end, and add your new domain name in their custom domain name menu (most platforms will have their own guide to help you along). Note that some platforms take a bit of time to detect new domain settings, so now might be a good time to walk the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Useful tip &amp;ndash; if your domain was transferred to iwantmyname from a different registrar, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to change your nameservers to iwantmyname (our instant setups won&amp;rsquo;t work otherwise). To set that up, click &lt;strong&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/strong&gt; in the dropdown under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then click &lt;strong&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/strong&gt;, then choose iwantmyname in the dropdown menu. And don&amp;rsquo;t forget to click the &lt;strong&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/strong&gt; button!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a platform that isn&amp;rsquo;t in the Marketplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-dns-records.png&#34; alt=&#34;DNS Records&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the blog, e-commerce, portfolio, etc., etc. platform you&amp;rsquo;re looking to use isn&amp;rsquo;t in our Marketplace, you can add DNS records manually by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/strong&gt; in the dropdown under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then click &lt;strong&gt;Edit DNS Records&lt;/strong&gt;, then add your records one-by-one. Most platforms will have setup guides for a number of different registrars, so hopefully a custom iwantmyname setup guide will be on the list, but if not, just follow their general custom domain instructions and you should be fine (we&amp;rsquo;re always &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;happy to help&lt;/a&gt; as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a platform that requires your own hosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-25-update-nameservers.png&#34; alt=&#34;Update nameservers&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a platform like Wordpress.org that requires you to find your own server space for your site to live on (for the brave, or more advanced users), you&amp;rsquo;ll have to first &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting&#34;&gt;figure out who you want to be your host&lt;/a&gt;. There are hundreds of hosting companies out there, but [we usually recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/&#34;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt; for basic users and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=c5a7f5e1af5e&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased some hosting space, all you have to do on our end is point your domain&amp;rsquo;s Nameservers to that service. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re using Bluehost, click &lt;strong&gt;Manage DNS&lt;/strong&gt; in the dropdown under &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; in the top nav, then click &lt;strong&gt;Update Nameservers&lt;/strong&gt;, then choose Bluehost in the dropdown menu. After that, all the settings to install your platform will be through your host (and they&amp;rsquo;ll usually have their own setup guides).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we wrap this up, there are a few things we want you to remember (this is your domain credo, of sorts):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to permanently mess things up, and changes made accidentally can be removed or restored. As long as you use correct contact information, keep your billing info up-to-date, and check your email semi-regularly for important updates, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be alright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve set everything up perfectly, sometimes it takes time for things to work their way through the internet (and nothing can speed it up). Patience is key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need help, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;just send us a message&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be able to help you out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And most of all, have fun with your new domain!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

				<title>Thinking beyond parental leave</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Parental leave is an important topic and one that we will hear more about because there is an over-arching societal conversation starting to happen. So we began having a look around at what other companies offer and found a list of tech companies and their parental leave policies which was a good start, but not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an international team with four different nationalities and spread across as many countries (New Zealand, Germany, Canada and the US), we wanted to find something that works for everyone. We were also aiming at offering an equal option for men who should have the opportunity to negotiate some time away from work to be with their new children and to support the mother or same-sex partner. And would you believe there is still no parental leave in the US, even for most mothers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not everyone might have plans to have kids in the future—whatever the reason may be. How can we accommodate them?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ins and outs of WHOIS privacy and accurate contact information</title>
				<description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-1&#34;&gt;The difference between a gTLD and a ccTLD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-2&#34;&gt;Requirements for information accuracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-3&#34;&gt;Editing gTLD contact information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#section-4&#34;&gt;Editing ccTLD contact information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, maintaining online privacy is understandably very important. Fortunately, to that end, WHOIS privacy is available for many types of domains &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;(see our full list here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling WHOIS privacy is a way to mask or hide your personal contact information as the domain registrant, so it&amp;rsquo;s not visible in &lt;a href=&#34;http://whois.domaintools.com/&#34;&gt;WHOIS lookups&lt;/a&gt;. Adding it to an iwantmyname domain name is easy (as long as your domain extension supports it)—in your dashboard, just click on the domain name, then click on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;enable privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone knows about the availability of WHOIS privacy, and we&amp;rsquo;ve seen many instances where people have used altered or fake contact information when registering their domains as a step to ensure their privacy. While we understand the motivation to do this, let&amp;rsquo;s clear up why it isn&amp;rsquo;t such a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1&#34;&gt;The difference between a gTLD and a ccTLD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big thing to understand is that there are two main categories of domains.  First, you have your gTLDs (generic top-level domains), which include &amp;ldquo;classics&amp;rdquo; like .COM and the new extensions like .PHOTOS or .PIZZA. These domains are under the control of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icann.org/&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they all follow the same policies and rules about how they are registered, how much they cost, how they are renewed, and information required of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other domain category is ccTLDs (country code top-level domains). These are all the ones that end with two letters, referencing actual geographical places in the world, e.g. .CA for Canada, .IO for Indian Ocean, etc. Unlike the gTLDs with ICANN, ccTLDs are not all under the control of one organization. Each ccTLD is governed by its own registry, managed by the country or geographical area (e.g. .CA domains are managed by CIRA, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, each ccTLD has different policies and rules regarding registration, renewal, pricing, etc. Those registries can basically do what they want in this regard. This is why some offer WHOIS privacy (see the above-linked list), but many do not. This is also why a .IO domain costs $59 to register, or a .MY domain costs $149USD. The registry can set whatever price it chooses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2&#34;&gt;Requirements for information accuracy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For gTLDs, ICANN has requirements for registrant information accuracy, which must be adhered to, or the domain registrant/owner risks the domain being suspended or deleted. This is also the case for ccTLDs, but they have their own registries&amp;rsquo; requirements, which may be more or less stringent than ICANN&amp;rsquo;s. For example, some registries require specific ID numbers for companies or individuals wanting to register a domain with their ccTLD. And some restrict who can register at all (e.g. you must be a resident of the European Union in some cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case for gTLDs, ccTLD domains can be suspended or deleted if the registrant contact information is not accurate and up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t ignore WDRP notices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time we hear from customers who have received a WDRP (WHOIS Data Reminder Policy) notice by email. Often they&amp;rsquo;re not sure what it&amp;rsquo;s for, or if it&amp;rsquo;s possibly a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registrars/consensus-policies/wdrp-en&#34;&gt;WDRP notices are legitimate&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to read them and to check your registration information to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s up to date. You can do this in your iwantmyname account dashboard by clicking on your domain name, then clicking on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;edit contacts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; on the next page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3&#34;&gt;Editing gTLD contact information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/media/2015-06-18-contact-details.png&#34; alt=&#34;contact details&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For gTLDs, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to update the domain contacts yourself and save the new settings at the bottom of the page. You can use the same contact name and information for all four (registrant/owner, admin, tech, and billing), or you can use different people or contact details (as long as it&amp;rsquo;s accurate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s particularly important to be sure that the email address set for the registrant/owner and admin contacts are valid and that you can access email there, as important notifications about renewals, transfers, etc. are sent to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive a WDRP notice, it is important that you follow the instructions and ensure that your information is up to date. Otherwise, ICANN is authorized to suspend or even delete your domain name, and you may not have any way to get it back. If you are concerned about your privacy, remember that adding WHOIS privacy &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; mask all of your personal details and contact information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, you can add WHOIS privacy for domain types that support it when you&amp;rsquo;re logged in to your iwantmyname account. In your dashboard, click on the domain name, then click on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;enable privacy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-4&#34;&gt;Editing ccTLD contact information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ccTLDs, sometimes you can update the domain contacts yourself. Sometimes you can update all of the contacts &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; registrant/owner. And sometimes you can update all of the other contacts and parts of the registrant/owner contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fairly common that the customer cannot make changes to the registrant/owner&amp;rsquo;s first/last name or company name themselves. This is because whatever person and/or company is listed as the registrant/owner contact is the legal owner of the domain. Those updates must be done at the administrative level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that the registrant contact, particularly, is accurate and up to date. Sometimes when you transfer a domain, it will still show the old registrar or hosting company&amp;rsquo;s contact information, especially if you had a privacy service turned on. You will need to update that after the transfer. (Use the &amp;ldquo;edit contacts&amp;rdquo; instructions listed above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for transferring a domain from one person or company to another. You will need to ensure that you update the domain contacts to your information, otherwise the domain still legally belongs to the person whose name is on it, even if you paid for it fair and square. (Domain ownership disputes tend to get very messy, often require legal consultation, and are slow to resolve.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ccTLDs require more complicated administrative functions to update domain contacts. In those instances, customers need to contact us as we will need to take care of those functions for you. They are usually done in other systems connected to the registries. Sometimes these changes have an associated cost. Most commonly there is a cost associated when a specific ccTLD registry categorizes changing a domain&amp;rsquo;s registrant contact as an &amp;ldquo;owner change&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are special requirements, processes, or costs required for updating a domain&amp;rsquo;s contact information, we will let you know beforehand. In certain cases, it can be fairly involved, requiring forms and other processes, but we will provide information for all steps, and take care of most of the heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/support&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re always happy to answer any questions&lt;/a&gt; about WDRP notices, privacy, security, WHOIS, domain registrations, transfers, renewals, contact information, or whatever&amp;rsquo;s on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ICANN wants to take away your rights to use WHOIS privacy</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet’s governing body &lt;a href=&#34;http://icann.org&#34;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt; is thinking of another controversial move, after the introduction of an (email) address verification process &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html&#34;&gt;that can make your website go dark&lt;/a&gt;. Just this time, it’s an attack on people’s privacy, and that’s something you shouldn’t take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savedomainprivacy.org&#34;&gt;savedomainprivacy.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed new rules, Providers would be required to monitor your use of domain names and websites. Providers could be forced to terminate your privacy service and be required to publish your contact data in WHOIS. Likewise, Providers could be required to give your private contact details to anyone complaining that your website violates their trademark or copyright. None of these scenarios would require a court order, search warrant, or due process of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize that Providers do not want criminals to abuse these services to hide their online activities from law enforcement. But some of the proposed changes would treat all users equally, regardless of their intent. For millions of legitimate users, these services are no more suspicious than getting an unlisted telephone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same people who already thought you could prevent crime by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html&#34;&gt;requiring domains to be verified&lt;/a&gt; which only resulted in innocent people having their websites disabled. Nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we will see exactly the same thing happening if these new &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/whois-privacy&#34;&gt;whois privacy&lt;/a&gt; policies are introduced. People who absolutely need to remain private could have their contact details exposed by anyone—without helping to catch criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this is a not-so-great (i.e. stupid) idea as much as we do, please &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.savedomainprivacy.org/sign-the-petition/&#34;&gt;make your voice heard to ICANN now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Relaunching my domain name based personal web presence</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m publishing this on Medium and not on my own domain name. Because it allows me to get my thoughts out of the system and share it with a wider audience until I‘ve made up my mind where and how to relaunch my personal web presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why relaunch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve got my own domain name, and it feels like I’m not making the best use of it at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never made the switch to English for personal long form writing since moving from Germany to Australia, and later to New Zealand. As a non-native English speaker, I often feel my writing isn’t good enough, and the following quote was a kick in the butt: “It is better to write not-well than to not write.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had plenty of discussions about personal sites and our individual voices on the web at work. Over the last few years, I’ve been writing quite a bit on the iwantmyname blog which is simply not me as a person, and I want to change this.&lt;/li&gt;

				<title>Are people moving into .APARTMENTS?</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apartments will never go out of style. They&amp;rsquo;re the cogs that keep low-density cities moving—an affordable option for those who don&amp;rsquo;t need the space a house provides. But what can you do with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-apartments&#34;&gt;.APARTMENTS&lt;/a&gt; domain? It&amp;rsquo;s not a job title, personal identifier, or generic business category. Apartments are simply a type of higher-density housing unit, making the TLD a specialized option to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.APARTMENTS are for apartments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though apartment complexes are all unique entities, apartment naming isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly an exercise in high creativity. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/apartment-names/&#34;&gt;Apartment Guide&amp;rsquo;s analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the community names in their system, they found more than a thousand complexes using the word &amp;ldquo;Park&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Village.&amp;rdquo; And nearly as many use words like &amp;ldquo;Place,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Creek,&amp;rdquo; Ridge,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Square.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of redundancy, and on a namespace like .COM, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a lot of varied domains using words like &amp;ldquo;apartments,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;community,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;apts&amp;rdquo; to separate themselves from unrelated companies using similar naming structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With .APARTMENTS, builders can simply use &amp;ldquo;name.APARTMENTS,&amp;rdquo; leaving out the identifiers needed in crowded, generic namespaces. Some creativity may come into play if 200 different &amp;ldquo;Village Pointe&amp;rdquo; apartments try to go after the same domain name, but at least the naming competition will be kept within the industry—not the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will that be enough?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, each of these new generic TLDs is a business. Some, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club&#34;&gt;.CLUB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz&#34;&gt;.XYZ&lt;/a&gt; seem to have a bright future due to their mass appeal. But others, like .APARTMENTS, are really going to have to fight to capture their niche audience. The underlying registry, Donuts, has hundreds of TLDs in their portfolio though, so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me at all to see a major ad push for extensions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru&#34;&gt;.GURU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography&#34;&gt;.PHOTOGRAPHY&lt;/a&gt;, and the aforementioned .APARTMENTS in the future. And who knows, maybe your .APARTMENTS domain will get featured!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.CHAT is perfect for podcasts, forums, and chat rooms</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the casual observer, chat rooms are likely a thing of the past. A relic of the early internet where people discussed big topics, sometimes took on bizarre identities, and quickly discovered how connected we could all be. But while term &amp;ldquo;chat room&amp;rdquo; has largely been removed from our vernacular, countless people are still chatting away online, making &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-chat&#34;&gt;.CHAT&lt;/a&gt; the perfect TLD for your next great forum, podcast, or chat room (they still exist!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.CHAT for forums&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as TLDs go, forums don&amp;rsquo;t really have a go-to namespace. Some use .COM, as it&amp;rsquo;s the most popular TLD. Some use .ORG and .NET, as forums are, by nature, networks and organizations. But with the .CHAT TLD, forums have a unique namespace that is relatively free from naming competition, informally describes what&amp;rsquo;s going on, and is familiar to those of us who began their web lives in the 90&amp;rsquo;s. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s not as direct as &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-forum&#34;&gt;.FORUM&lt;/a&gt;, but .CHAT clearly has a place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.CHAT for podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, podcasts come in all shapes and sizes. Some feature investigative stories, some feature very specific advice—but some are just people talking to each other. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that a formal conversation would probably use something a little less loose than .CHAT, but any show featuring casual conversations would work perfectly. Think morning.CHAT, work.CHAT, or chrisandtimo.CHAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.CHAT definitely still works for chat rooms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backtracking a bit, just because chat rooms are less popular today than they once were doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they don&amp;rsquo;t exist. Surprisingly, using Google Keyword Planner, the term &amp;ldquo;chat room&amp;rdquo; still gets 246,000 searches a month, and if you do a simple search for &amp;ldquo;chat room&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;ll find a huge collection of chat rooms waiting to be discovered. So if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to start a chat room anytime soon, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly still a demand (or maybe there&amp;rsquo;s just a large legacy supply&amp;hellip; do your research)—and .CHAT is as perfect a TLD as you&amp;rsquo;ll ever find (maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll even chime in if you go on to create domain.CHAT).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>.STYLE on the web is subjective</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as TLDs go, style is an interesting word. It&amp;rsquo;s not a job description or a thing you do—instead, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a process. Style can be the way you make something, or a specific form that&amp;rsquo;s trying to be achieved. You can have good style, bad style, correct style, or maybe you just want your haircuts styled a certain way. But what can you do with a .STYLE domain name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.STYLE blogs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs, particularly online collections (think long Tumblr sites), are perhaps the best place for .STYLE domains to live. Unlike a business or brand, a style blog can be a collection of anything about a movement. Mid-century style could live on midcentury.STYLE. Your collection of Mannerist style architecture could easily find a home on mannerist.STYLE. Or if your love is typography, typographic.STYLE might be just what you&amp;rsquo;re after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.STYLE is for writers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of professional writing, style is what keeps the world consistent. But style reference books, like the AP Stylebook, Oxford Manual of Style, and the The Chicago Manual of Style, aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly the easiest things to get through (the AP Stylebook is nearly 400 pages)—so this is where the internet comes in. There are style sites online for every type of writing you could imagine, and with a .STYLE domain, they could all move to a namespace free of clutter (and grammar mistakes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.STYLE makes for a great domain hack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/04/everything-you-need-to-know-about-domain-hacks.html&#34;&gt;domain hack&lt;/a&gt; thought starters using .STYLE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hair.STYLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;life.STYLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free.STYLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pro.STYLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;old.STYLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

				<title>.TENNIS just makes sense for the largely web-adverse tennis community</title>
				<description>&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions&#34;&gt;hundreds of TLDs&lt;/a&gt; (the part after the dot, like COM in .COM) available now, sports TLDs are some of the hardest to find uses for. At this point, many of the world&amp;rsquo;s major sports leagues are enormous commercial entities, making .COM an ideal solution. Individual players are also unlikely to come over in droves, given the extreme specificity of an ending like .TENNIS. But &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tennis&#34;&gt;.TENNIS&lt;/a&gt; in particular does have a couple important uses—providing open namespaces for local tennis associations/clubs and tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.TENNIS for local tennis associations/clubs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many sports associations, organized tennis is a big tangle of domain naming practices. Long names, assorted TLDs, jumbled words—it&amp;rsquo;s a mess. For example, here are a few from around the world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Wellington Tennis Club uses wellingtontennisclub.org.nz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Auckland Tennis Association uses tennisauckland.co.nz (notice the .co.nz instead of the .org.nz Wellington uses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Houston Tennis Association uses houstontennis.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Ontario Tennis Association uses tennisontario.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of these assorted naming practices, imagine if they all used this—cityname.TENNIS? It&amp;rsquo;s nice and short, and aside from small cities with the same names as larger cities, the naming could be standardized around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;.TENNIS for tournaments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just going through the USTA (US Tennis Association) Tennis Link, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how many local tournaments simply don&amp;rsquo;t have websites. The tournament information pages clearly have a place for a tournament website to go, but more often than not, these tournaments are run, organized, and managed without a web presence (hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s better in other countries). And that&amp;rsquo;s insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone attached to a tennis tournament happens to read this, might I recommend creating a quick &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; (we have so many available for one-click installs) and using a domain name like tournamentname.TENNIS? The younger generations would greatly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
