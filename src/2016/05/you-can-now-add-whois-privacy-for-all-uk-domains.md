On May 1st, we are updating the availability of our WHOIS privacy service for .UK domains. This update affects all .UK domain extensions:

* .UK
* .CO.UK
* .ME.UK
* .ORG.UK

Previously, adding WHOIS privacy to .UK domains was something customers had to send a request for. The availability was also limited only to domains registered to individuals, excluding those registered to companies.

As of May 1st, customers will be able to add the WHOIS privacy service themselves for any .UK domains they have registered, whether they're registered to an individual or company.

In your iwantmyname dashboard on the domain's page, just click on **enable privacy**.

Online privacy is an ever-evolving issue, and we're pleased to see this development. As always, if you have any questions, [just let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
