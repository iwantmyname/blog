title: Sunsetting of some second-level CentralNic TLDs
excerpt: false
----

We have recently been notified that the CentralNic registry will be sunsetting a number of second-level TLDs:

* .AR.COM
* .GB.COM
* .HU.COM
* .KR.COM
* .QC.COM
* .NO.COM
* .SE.COM
* .UY.COM

Registrations and transfers for these TLDs were disabled on April 29th, so no new domains with those extensions can be registered, and existing registrations cannot be transferred to a new registrar.

Note also that these TLDs are being entirely discontinued, so will expire at all registrars, not just with us.

**The zones for domains with these TLDs will be deleted on April 30th, 2017**. So any existing websites or email using these domains will work until that date, at which time they will stop working permanently. 

You will need to migrate any websites or email services that you want to keep, and which are using domains with these TLDs, to a new domain name before the zones are deleted. 

We would recommend doing this migration well before the final expiry date, and then setting up web forwarding for any websites from the old domain name to the new one so your site visitors can get used to the new domain name before it's completely gone.

We're happy to advise and help with any changes or new setup, of course.

Domains registered with these TLDs can no longer be renewed, either. So any domain registered with one of the TLDs that has an expiry date prior to April 30th, 2017 will expire and be deleted after its expiry date. It will not be available until the final zone deletion date.

This also means that there will be no more billings for domains registered with these TLDs. Any notifications or receipts you receive from us will be for other domains in your account.

We'll be contacting all customers who have domains registered with these TLDs to ensure that they have all the necessary information and get things updated however they prefer.

So why are these TLDs being discontinued? We don't know exactly why, but it does happen sometimes. Note that these aren't "official" TLDs, and they're not governed by a country's registry like ccTLDs. They're actually just subdomains of .COM that the CentralNic registry decided to offer. (So this sunsettings does **not** affect any actual ccTLD domains.)

Perhaps there was just less interest with [all the new gTLDs available](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions).

If there are any furture changes or sunsetting of other CentralNic second-level domains, we'll be sure to let you know. If you have any questions, [just let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support). But the number of domains affecting is fairly small, so won't affect most customers.
