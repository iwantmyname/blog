## Adobe Portfolio

We previously reported on [why there wasn't a one-click install for Adobe Portfolio in our Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/05/one-click.html).

Well, good news, everyone! Adobe Portfolio now has standard DNS records, so we have added a one-click install for it to our Marketplace. 

In your domain dashboard, just search for Adobe Portfolio, or find it in our Marketplace in the [Portfolio](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/portfolio-hosting/) section. Enjoy!

## Bitly

Bitly has updated their DNS records and has contacted customers to let them know that they need to update by June 29th, 2016. 

Updating these records is quite easy. If you login to your account and go to your domain dashboard, type bit.ly into the Marketplace search field.

![find bitly](http://iwmn.me/19Pwy/envt6DcP+)

On the next page, click on the **Install bit.ly** button to add the new records you need.

![install bitly](http://iwmn.me/bB3T/5wF8J8fY+)

Then you're done and the DNS records have been updated.

If you see a red button on the install page instead that says **Remove bit.ly**, that's fine. Just click that to remove the old records, then click on the green Install button when the page refreshes.

If you have any questions or have trouble updating the records, we're happy to help, [just let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
