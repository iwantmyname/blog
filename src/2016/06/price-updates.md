Over the next little while, you may notice some changes to our pricing for registrations and renewals. These prices will show up on [our pricing page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions). You will also see them when we notify you about any upcoming renewals for your domains.

Note that new pricing will only affect new registrations going forward, and will only affect your *next* renewal. There won't be any changes to prices billed for already-completed registrations, nor any renewals processed mid-billing cycle.

Yes, it does mean that some pricing will go up. Currencies fluctuate, registries update their pricing, and other industry changes affect our pricing as well. The good news is that prices for some TLDs will go down.

Our monthly sales are still in effect, [which you can see here](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer), or [in our newsletter](https://iwantmyname.com/monthly), and on our main pricing page as well.

We also recommend this article outlining [why pricing varies among registrars](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/02/why-domain-prices-can-vary-among-registrars.html), and why and how we set prices as we do.

As always, if you have any questions, [just let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
