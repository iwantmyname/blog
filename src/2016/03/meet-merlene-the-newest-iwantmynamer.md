Merlene is a self-described hoarder. Fortunately, she hoards domains, and not cats or anything weird. (She insists that two cats do not qualify as a hoard).

Having been self-employed for a long time, Merlene is familiar with all sides of the online business game, from registering domains to teaching customers how to post content and use their email accounts. She has extensive experience working with everyone from IT staff to small business people to complete newbs, so she can help figure out what you need and get it built.

She can also help with your social media and marketing efforts, mix you a killer cocktail, and knit you cool stuff. (She's a hobbyist yarn entrepreneur at [knitcreek.com](https://knitcreek.com/).)

Amazingly, even though Merlene didn't mention in her interviews the fact that long ago, in the mists of Internet time, she contributed to one of the Internets for Dummies books, we were totally jazzed to hire her.

In her first weeks on board, we threw her in the deep end with support, and she's done swimmingly. She even tackles tricky ccTLD edge cases with gusto. Unfortunately, while she's with us in New Zealand, her home is without tech support, and the residents may end up forced to converse with each other, or just post cat gifs... assuming internet access holds...

PS. It is, indeed, Merlene with three Es.
