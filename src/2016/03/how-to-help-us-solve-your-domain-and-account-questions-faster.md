<!-- excerpt -->

When you contact us about a question or problem you're having, obviously you want it sorted out quickly. We want that, too. So here's an outline of what we need to know to help you as quickly and painlessly as possible. 

Most of it will be pretty straightforward, but on the off chance you have an issue that can't be fixed immediately, you'll now have a better understanding of why that is.

<h2 id="section-1">About you</h2>

When you contact support, the most fundamental thing we need to know is that you are, in fact, the real account holder (or, at least, someone like a web developer who the account holder has granted access).

The easiest way to do this is to log in to your account and then use [our support form](https://iwantmyname.com/support) to contact us. When you do that, it verifies that you have access to the account and lets us know the login email address. For some things, we don't need to authenticate you. Some questions we can just answer. But we can't share account, payment, or domain ownership information without authentication (for both security and privacy reasons).

If your problem is that you're not able to log in though, sending us an authenticated request is nearly impossible. In these situations, we have to do an account holder authentication. We'll need documentation that matches what we have on record to prove your identity, such as something with your name and contact details, or possibly your credit card holder name, card type, number, etc. for a billing issue, depending on the situation. (Once we've confirmed who you are, we don't keep or use that documentation for anything else.)

We take our customers' account security very seriously, and without sufficient proof, we're not going to give anyone access to an account. We know that can be frustrating and take extra time, but remember, your personal and financial information and intellectual property are in your account. You *want* us to be sticklers.

<h2 id="section-2">About your domain</h2>

Now that we've confirmed who you are, we now need to know which domain we need to look at (you'd be amazed how often people forget to mention that part).

To help us find the domain faster, there are a few things to be mindful of. Is the problem with the .COM or .CO version? Are you sure it's registered with us? If it expired "a while ago", was that a couple of months, or a couple of years? Also, if you have more than one account with us, mentioning that is helpful, too. 

If you're not sure of a detail listed above, logging in to your account to check can help. Or you can do a [WHOIS lookup](http://whois.domaintools.com/) to see the domain's registration information in many cases. (Don't stress out too much though, if you forget a bit of information, we're pretty good at figuring domain stuff out.)

<h2 id="section-3">About the problem</h2>

Once we know which domain we're looking at, the goal is for you to be like a detective when you tell us about the problem. Obviously we don't expect you to know everything (that's our job), but try to give us all the information you can. Things like:

+ My website was working this morning, and now it isn't. 
+ Before it stopped working, I made X changes.
+ Things stopped working right after setting up new DNS records or nameservers.
+ I've had trouble paying for a renewal.

The more details we have, the faster we can hunt down and sort out the issue for you. As mentioned, it's okay if you don't know what's wrong. We just need to know what you wanted (or didn't want) to happen.

([We also have a comprehensive help centre to assist you as well.](https://help.iwantmyname.com/) There's a good chance your issue or question is covered there. And if your problem is new, we'll probably use the experience to add more articles to explain it.)

Sometimes, though, there are limits to what we can fix. Here are some things we can't do:

+ We can't do anything with domains registered at other registrars
+ We can't edit DNS records when your hosting is with a different provider. (We don't have access to that account even if your domain is registered with us.) 
+ We can't make changes in your accounts on other platforms or services, like website or email. 

In these situations, we can ask a few questions and maybe make a recommendation, but usually we'll advise contacting their support for a more definitive answer.

<h2 id="section-4">It'll work, don't worry</h2>

Most of the time we can answer questions or fix things right away. Sure, it can take a little bit of time for settings to propagate, services to start working, or new sites to come online, but for the most part, things go pretty quick.

Occasionally though, the problem is outside of our system, like an issue with a ccTLD registry where they need to update or fix something on their end. We do our best to communicate with them (and you) to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, but cases like that can take more time than we'd like â€“ sometimes even a few days.

As far as site update requests and feedback go, we read every message. After talking things over with the team, suggestions either get added to our update queue, get fixed or built right away (usually critical issues or easy things to accomplish), or just aren't possible (yet... we love hearing pie-in-the-sky ideas). We're always listening though, and considering how we can make our service better for customers, so [please don't hesitate to send us a message](https://iwantmyname.com/support)!
