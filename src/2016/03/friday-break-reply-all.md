If you like podcasts, this is one of my favorites. And this episode is about domain names!

[From Reply All, episode #59](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/59-good-job-alex/):

> ALEX: So I was thinking, “Wow.” So Alisa had this website. She had it professionally designed many moons ago. When it was still really hard to design a website. So had someone design it for her.

> PJ: Like HTML days.

> ALEX: Yes. But it was really clunky and difficult to use, so she started getting notices from GoDaddy, and she was just like, fine, this thing can expire. But the thing is, that she didn’t quite understand what would happen when you let your domain name expire. I think she just assumed that the site itself would go away, but nothing would happen to the domain name. Like she could come back to it whenever she wanted.

> PJ: Mm mm.

> ALEX: Are you saying, “No she didn’t think that,” or “No that’s not what happens?”

> PJ: I’m saying the thing she believed in the past was not true.
