If you're using GitLab as your Git repository manager and want to create a quick, static site about a project (or anything, really), GitLab Pages is your ticket. Much like GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages lets you host static sites directly on your GitLab instance. Just choose a static site generator, use a free shared runner (or your own), and start editing. 

Is it for everyone? No. If you're a casual blogger or someone looking at do-it-all site builders like Squarespace, GitLab Pages probably isn't for you. But if you're already using GitLab, or have been waiting for a Pages-type feature to coerce you into switching over from Github, this is perfect.

[Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/22/gitlab-just-launched-another-feature-that-will-help-it-compete-with-github/): "Step by step, GitLab, the startup behind the GitLab open source software for managing source code, is becoming more competitive with GitHub, the company well known for hosting source code for many applications."
