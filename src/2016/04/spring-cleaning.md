Spring has arrived here in the western hemisphere. Along with the warmer breezes and blooming flowers, the urge to tidy has gripped many of us.

I know I've embraced clearing out, organizing, and scrubbing, and this motivation is useful beyond just the house and yard. Spring is a great time to do a little maintenance on your domains.

The most obvious target are those websites many of us have that are dusty and neglected. They're not dead, they just need a fresh approach, perhaps. Timo wrote a great article last month on just that topic: [Struggling to update your site? Maybe it's time to do something different with your domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html).

It's often the case that we've built an archive, recognition and brand value, so no reason to throw that away. What the internet looks like and how people use it changes over time. No reason for your own domains and web properties not to reflect that.

Sometimes getting inspired again can be as easy as freshening up the template or theme of your site or adding some new graphics. Fortunately, so many platforms now have fantastic and simple tools for getting the look just right.

Beyond that, if you're ready to try something new, why not register a domain for that idea you've been mulling over for months? [There are hundreds of domain extensions now](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), so there's no excuse that you just can't find the perfect name.

[There are also new platforms and services for your web projects launching all the time](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/new), whether it's crafting or content curation. Take the leap!

Perhaps you've already been working on a project for a while, and have a website set up. You've been blogging like a pro or selling gorgeous knitwear over the long winter. Now it's time to step it up a notch. Let's get your branding consistent across all your professional work. Time for a custom email address with your domain name.

One of our most popular articles ever is [our guide to getting your own custom email address](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/06/the-guide-to-getting-your-own-custom-email-address.html). [There are more options out there than ever](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/email-hosting/), whether your goal is ease of setup, high-end security, or integration with other apps.

We're happy to help set up any of the email hosting provider partners listed in our Marketplace, or assist with whatever other host you're interested in using.

Being able to ensure that messages from us don't get marked as spam is just one of the benefits! [Don't let us get caught in your spam filter](https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/2409422) is also a handy article.

On the less visible side of things, it's always important to keep up with good security and administrative practices. When was the last time you updated your passwords?

Are you using a tool like a password manager? It makes password management much easier and is more secure.

Have you added two-factor authentication to your accounts where possible? Check out our guide to good password and account safety: [How to keep your passwords and logins safe](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/07/how-to-keep-your-passwords-and-logins-safe.html).

Also, it would be a good idea to check on your iwantmyname account contact details, both for your [iwantmyname account](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/account/personal) and for your domains' registrant contacts ("edit contacts" in your domain's dashboard).

It's pretty common for people to move, for email addresses to change, credit cards to expire, businesses to be acquired and employees to move on, and other bits of administrivia we forget about.

These can become a big pain when it prevents access or updates to our accounts and domains. Or worse, legal issues (especially for companies).

Our guide: [Who owns your domain?](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/12/who-owns-your-domain.html) provides a good way to ensure your accounts are up to date and secure.

ICANN and registries do checks every now and then to ensure domains' registrant details are up to date. You might receive a WDRP notice. We have an article to explain what that means and what to do: [What is a WDRP notice and do I have to do anything?](https://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2093089-what-is-a-wdrp-notice-and-do-i-have-to-do-anything-)

And, of course, inevitably with spring cleaning, there's some purging. Things that no longer work or fit or you just don't use. Lots of us end up sitting on domain names for years that we've never used. The original idea might have been amazing, but there was just never enough time, or you lost interest, or whatever.

You can set unwanted domains to expire in your dashboard before you're billed for renewal again. Or you can try and make some cash by selling the domain to an interested party.

We don't participate in sales or brokerage, but we have some information in [this article](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/05/the-guide-to-getting-the-right-domain-name-for-your-brand.html#section-4) about who you can contact for that. Good luck!

There, now don't you feel better? Your accounts and domains are up to date and organized. You've got a fresh new look and fascinating new content. Your branding is professional and on point, and those old domains will gain new life with new owners. Happy spring!
