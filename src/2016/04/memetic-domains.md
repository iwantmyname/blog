The Internet is not known for having a long attention span. This includes the lifespan of memes.

Vernacular, however, can work a bit differently. Typically it has its genesis among a specific group – often *the kids these days* – and then spreads among the more mainstream population, particularly via social media. 

At which point it's abandoned by its originating group because their parents have just embarrassed them by using it. In public.

The phrase referenced by the abbreviation "AF" isn't new. ()We won't elaborate on what it means as we are demure professionals...) I saw references in Urban Dictionary dating back to 2011, but apparently the use, at least verbally, picked up in 2014, in good part thanks to online chat and texting.

.AF domains aren't new, either, but I've noticed an increase in their registration in the last few months. They're certainly a bold identity statement... at least among those in the know. :)

You could let the world know that you're [interesting.af](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=interesting.af).

Or I can advertise that I am the most me that I can be with [melle.af](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=melle.af).

I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed to learn that [cake.af](http://cake.af) does not appear to involve actual cake.

What I really wonder about is what the registry thinks of the ccTLD's popularity. Because .AF is the country code domain extension for Afghanistan. And like a number of smaller countries, in terms of internet penetration, the registry is managed by the government.

Governments aren't typically known to be on the bleeding edge of all that's hip and memetastic, but I'd love to know what the Ministry of Communications and IT thinks of this trend. 

However, given the price of .AF domains, one imagines they're very supportive of the trend continuing.
