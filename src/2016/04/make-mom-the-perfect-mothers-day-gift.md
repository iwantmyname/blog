title: Make .MOM the perfect Mother's Day gift, and more domain extension news
excerpt: false
----

We often think of domains as these forever pieces of property meant for big sites that attract as many eyes as humanly possible, but what if you just want to make one person happy? Domains can do that, too! Here's a mini gift guide for Mom, perfect for Mother's Day (May 8th... put it on your calendar).

1. Pre-order a [.MOM domain]([.MOM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-mom)). Make it something your mom will go "awwwwww" over.
2. On May 3rd, when you get your domain, find as many great pictures of you and your mom as you can. (Bonus points for grandchildren pics, if you're into that).
3. Create a quick [photo site](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/) or [blog](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/) out of the pics, or be ambitious and create an [Exposure](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/exposure-photo-websites) story. Exposure is a cool platform for piecing together photos to create a little (or long) narrative â€“ it's a guaranteed crowd pleaser. (And since your site will be public, your mom can send it to all her friends to show them how creative you are.)
4. You can take the site down anytime, but as long as you renew the domain, you can reuse it every year.
5. Send flowers. Always send flowers.
