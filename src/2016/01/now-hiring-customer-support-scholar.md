title: Now hiring: Customer support scholar
excerpt: false
----

Let's break this down. We're looking for a very patient person to help our global audience do great things with domains. You'll help them register domains, you'll help them with billing issues, you'll help them use their domains, and you might even help them with an idea or two. Whatever they need, you'll be there to help.

The "scholar" bit wasn't just for fun though. To be great at this job, you have to want to learn. About domain names, our processes, our systems, and how people use them. The learning never stops, and the right person will love soaking it up.

***

Unlike many of our job openings, this job is for people in and around our timezone (we're in Wellington, NZ). We could possibly make an exception for the right person elsewhere, but you must be available during New Zealand, Australian, or Asian business hours.

***

Here's the list of the skills we're looking for:

+ You absolutely have to have plus plus English language writing skills. You’ll be writing a lot, and English is our business communication language. (If you happen to speak/write another language, it would certainly be a bonus.)
+ You must like people (like, actually like them). No matter how frustrated the customer, you need to be able to clearly and completely solve problems without becoming (noticeably) impatient.
+ Curiosity. You don’t have to be the world’s foremost domains expert to work here, but a little curiosity will go a long way in solving problems.
+ That said, some knowledge of domains, DNS, and the internet would be advantageous. We'll be teaching you a ton, but we'd rather not start with "this is what a Nameserver is."
+ This is key - you need to be able to work without supervision. There will almost always be a someone to help you through problems (especially in the beginning), but for the most part, you need to be able to solve problems on your own.
