title: Host And Share Files On Your Custom Domain With Droplr
----

[Droplr](http://droplr.com "Droplr") is a little Mac application that runs in your menubar and can be used for uploading, hosting and sharing files with your favourite Twitter client or other apps. What we really like with Droplr is the custom domain option. Simply enter your own [short domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search "Short Domain Search") into their web application, change the DNS A record settings and all links to your hosted files will contain your branded URL immediately.

It's best to see it in action so watch the demo video below and see how easy Droplr works with Twitter or email:

The service is currently in private beta but we could score some invites for you which will be raffled among all commenters to this blog post (don't forget to leave your email address).
