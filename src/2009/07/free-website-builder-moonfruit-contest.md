title: Happy Birthday Moonfruit! Now also supported at iWantMyName.
----

We wish the Moonfruit team all the best for their 10th birthday. They're not only great guys (we met them at ICANN Sydney last week) but they currently also give you the chance to [win 10 new release MacBook Pro's](http://www.moonfruitlounge.com/post/2009/06/30/Celebrate-10-years-of-Moonfruit-and-win-a-MacBook-Pro "Win a MacBook Pro with Moonfruit Free Website Builder") (!) during a birthday celebration.

That's why we've also added [Moonfruit](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/moonfruit-simple-website-builder "Free easy website Builder Moonfruit") to our Domains for Apps offering. If you've registered a domain with us and want to connect it to a Moonfruit site this can be easily done from your iWantMyName dashboard now.
