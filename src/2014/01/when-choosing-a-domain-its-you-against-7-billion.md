**I.** According to [worldometers.info](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/), as of writing this post there are 7,207,045,692 people on Earth. Just this year we've added 3,732,015 people, and that number is going up every second. 

On a similar rise is the world of domains. In many of our lifetimes, the internet has gone from 0 domains to [265 million worldwide](http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/infographic-dnib-Q32013.pdf) ([including every four-letter .COM combination](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html)). Needless to say, that's quite a lot. And with an estimated 77% of the developed world online at the moment, that number is getting larger and larger by the minute. 

But what's most important to remember about domains is that when people register them, they often do what they can to protect their brand. That often includes:

+ .COM and .NET
+ Any ccTLD that might relate to the brand, like .IO and .FM (tech favorites)
+ Any TLD that might form a domain hack

So if you talk to an entrepreneurial soul, he/she might have a ton of domains--some for projects they're working on, some for future projects that failed and some that just haven't been around long enough to expire. I myself have 13 domains right now, and I know many people who have much more.

**II.** As a domain registrar, we get tweets like this one every once in a while:

>beware searching domains on @iwantmyname, got a few immediately bought out by squatters

I suppose this is a reasonable concern--if I were looking for a domain name and a corresponding domain hack and both were taken on the same day, my first reaction would probably be "WTF?!?!"

But if you think about it, the odds of your desired domain being entirely original isn't all that great. Again, there are millions of domains registered, and more are registered every day. 

And truth is, if someone was stalking and buying up all the domain search results that go through iwantmyname, they'd be broke pretty fast. There are *a lot* of searches happening, and it often takes people a few tries to pair a brand name they like with a domain they can find. 

Heck, just look at what [Marco Arment went through](http://www.marco.org/2013/09/24/naming-overcast) to finally come up with Overcast.fm as his new podcast app. Branding is hard, and now with domains being such a crucial aspect, it's harder than ever. 

**III.** That's why we're so excited about the [new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) currently being [delegated by ICANN](http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings). Instead of getting bottlenecked by a relatively small number of TLDs to choose from, you'll have access to hundreds of new gTLDs. 

If your name is Fred and you're opening a restaurant and can't get fredsfood.com, just pick up fred.restaurant, fred.pub, fred.food or fred.eat. Some of the more common names will certainly get snapped up, but your options will be much greater. 

**IV.** At the end of the day, just know that there isn't a plot against you. [We promise that we're not secretly registering domains before you do](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/iwantmyname-does-not-register-domains-you-have-searched-for.html), and it's *highly* unlikely that you're being singled out in a very large crowd.

So next time you have a "Eureka!" moment and need a domain name, be really quick. As the saying goes, it's you against the world...

...and checking now, 277,589 people have been born today!
