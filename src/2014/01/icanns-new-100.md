> In addition to the increase in choice of available domain names, the delegation of more than 100 new gTLDs means the Internet is being reshaped as a truly global resource. The following statistics are encouraging, particularly when one considers that these are only a fraction of the potential new gTLDs (there are over 1,300 possibilities):
>
> + **9 Countries**
>
>   New gTLD Registries with delegated gTLDs are operating in nine countries, including Australia, China and Switzerland.
>
>
> + **7 Languages**
>
>   The original 22 gTLDs consist of Latin characters only, and most are abbreviated English words. Examples of newly introduced languages include Arabic, Chinese, German, and Russian.
>
> + **2 Communities**
>
>   Registries for gTLDs .WIEN and .BERLIN self-identified as community applicants, signifying their intention to operate the gTLDs on behalf of the citizens of Vienna and Berlin, respectively.
