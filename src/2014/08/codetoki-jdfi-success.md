Last month my son and I jumped into a big silver bird and headed north to check out the [start-up scene in tropical Singapore](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/leaping-into-singapores-startup-scene.html). During our visit to the business friendly island state we not only enjoyed the famous nighttime cuisine, but also made many new friends in the start-up community.

We were [made welcome](https://twitter.com/jfdiasia/status/490113108845682690) at co-working space JFDI Asia, also widely regarded as Asia's leading tech accelerator. The JFDI crew had only just recovered from their [big demo day](http://e27.co/jfdi-2014a-cohort-graduates-bang-20140709/0) the previous week, so the place was still abuzz with "joyful" entrepreneurs, mentors and interns, especially so as there was also a [visit by Dave McClure](https://twitter.com/jfdiasia/status/489331687126360064) and [Geeks On A Plane](http://geeksonaplane.com/goap_destinations/southeast-asia/) that same week.

A number of JFDI alumni are iwantmyname customers already, so it was a great thrill to sit down with some of the freshly minted start-up founders and chat about future directions. Bearing in mind the [recent hardships](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/philippines-disaster-six-months-downstream.html) faced by the Philippines, it was especially wonderful to meet Codetoki co-founder Honeylyn Balingcasag. 

[Codetoki](http://codetoki.com), which originally emerged as a concept from the 2012 Cebu Startup Weekend, is a gamified application that match-makes job applicants with employers in the software industry, based on credits earned through various coding challenges. Codetoki has already established some key relationships in the IT industry, and boasts a growing user base made up of the youthful and well-educated workforces throughout the Asia-Pacific countries and beyond. 

Codetoki is one of several startups I met with at JDFI, many of whom are addressing real world needs in fun and practical ways with the guidance of excellent advisors. It was refreshing to see such a vibrant scene firsthand, and if you're ever in Singapore, this is one stop you shouldn't miss.
