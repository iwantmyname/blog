[From the Official Gmail Blog:](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/a-first-step-toward-more-global-email.html)

> In 2012, an organization called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created a new email standard that supports addresses with non-Latin and accented Latin characters (e.g. 武＠メール.グーグル). In order for this standard to become a reality, every email provider and every website that asks you for your email address must adopt it. That’s obviously a tough hill to climb. The technology is there, but someone has to take the first step.

> Today we're ready to be that someone. Starting now, Gmail (and shortly, Calendar) will recognize addresses that contain accented or non-Latin characters. This means Gmail users can send emails to, and receive emails from, people who have these characters in their email addresses. Of course, this is just a first step and there’s still a ways to go. In the future, we want to make it possible for you to use them to create Gmail accounts.

One of the biggest hurdles for the adoption of non-Latin generic top-level domains (gTLDs) was the fact that their associated email addresses weren't compatible with many of the most popular mail platforms. But now, with Gmail making the jump, we're hopefully a few steps closer to a more welcoming web—one where characters from any language can be sent and recieved without hangups or restrictions.

## A quick look at non-Latin gTLD popularity

Just because non-Latin gTLDs weren't guaranteed to work in mail clients didn't mean they weren't popular though—four are currently sitting in the overall [top 100](http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/):

It'll be interesting to see how much they grow in the following weeks after this announcement and the others that will hopefully follow. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a non-Latin gTLD in the top-5 by the end of the year.
