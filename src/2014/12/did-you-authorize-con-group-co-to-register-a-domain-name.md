title: Did you authorize Con Group Co. to register a domain name?
excerpt: no
----

[From Andrew Allemann - Domain Name Wire:](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/12/15/best-fake-name-used-in-a-domain-name-scam-ever/)

>Here’s how it works: A scammer, typically pretending to be an Asian domain name registrar, sends an email to the owner of a domain name and says that someone else is trying to register domain names using the same brand. The scammer says they’re reaching out as a courtesy. If the recipient doesn’t respond, the scammer says it will go forward with registering the domain names. The con is to try to get you to register the domains as a preventative measure.

>Most of these scam emails identify the name of the purported company trying to register the “brand” in various ccTLDs. My wife got one of these emails over the weekend, and the name of the purported company is, well, quite hilarious.
