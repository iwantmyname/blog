If you've been on the [iwantmyname website](https://iwantmyname.com/) lately, you might've noticed a change in parts of the site—a new multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices (and accepting payments) in only USD (US Dollar), you can switch currencies to NZD (New Zealand Dollar), GBP (British Pound), AUD (Australian Dollar), and EUR (Euro). It's a small feature, but one we're really happy to roll out.

### A Little Backstory

For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard. 

But now we're a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we've officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we're really happy with how it's working (being based in New Zealand, it's nice to be able to pay in NZD).

So next time you're looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currency: in the footer (see screenshot below), on all our price lists (like [this one](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions)), and in your account payment settings. We've also set it up to be location aware, so new customers should automatically be assigned to their correct currency. Once switched, all prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.
