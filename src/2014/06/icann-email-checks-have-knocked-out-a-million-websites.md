title: ICANN email checks have knocked out a million websites—don't let yours be next
----

<!-- excerpt -->

Back in January we [wrote an article](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html) informing everyone of ICANN's new rules for verifying contact information. To recap, "When you register a domain with new contact details, transfer existing domains or change the registrant (owner) or email address on your contact information, you will receive an additional email with an activation link. **If you don't press this link, your domain will be disabled after 15 days**."

As a domain registrar, rules like these are quite scary because we're the point of contact when things go wrong, and there's really nothing we can do to fix an ICANN-suspended domain other than point customers to their verification error landing pages. Our hope was that the process would go smoothly for our customers (and thankfully we haven't had too many issues), but it seems to be a pretty big issue for the internet at large.

From Kevin Murphy - [Domain Incite](http://domainincite.com/16963-a-million-domains-taken-down-by-email-checks?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DomainIncite+%28DomainIncite.com%29):

>Over 800,000 domain names have been suspended since the beginning of the year as a result of Whois email verification rules in the new ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement.

>That’s according to the Registrars Stakeholder Group, which collected suspension data from registrars representing about 75% of all registered gTLD domain names.

>The actual number of suspended domains could be closer to a million.

So, just for the sake of being safe, I'll end this post the same way we ended our original post on the subject. 

##So what should you do now?

As soon as you are able, please ensure that your domain name is associated with a valid email address. The last thing we want is for you to make a change, then have your verification email sent to an old address.

Also, if you purchase a domain or make a change after January 2014 and don't receive an email, or if you just have questions about the new ICANN rules, please [get in touch](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
