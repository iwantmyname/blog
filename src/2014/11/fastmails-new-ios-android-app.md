Google Apps are fine—in fact, they're quite wonderful and have changed the industry in so many ways—but there are countless reasons why you might want to go with something non-Google for your email. Fortunately, there are quite a few alternatives out there, and one of our very favorites, [FastMail](https://iwantmyname.com/services/hosted-email/fastmail-mail-hosting-own-domain), released an awesome new app today making it an even more viable Google alternative. 

Check out all the app's details on the [FastMail Weblog](http://blog.fastmail.com/2014/11/12/fastmail-app-for-ios-and-android-now-available/), or just download it now (for free) on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fastmail-email-calendars-contacts/id931370077?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastmail.app).
