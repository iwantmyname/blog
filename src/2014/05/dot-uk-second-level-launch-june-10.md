title: Drop the .co from your .co.uk domains—get yourname.uk starting June 10th

As [previously announced](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/uk-domains-without-the-co-coming-summer-2014.html), second-level .UK domains will launch on June 10, 2014. This will allow you to register names such as yourname.uk or yourbusiness.uk instead of having to use the .CO.UK suffix.

Be aware though that the .UK registry, Nominet, is making things a bit tricky for domain owners. We've learned that second-level .UK domains can only be registered if the domain owner or an administrative contact has a valid address in the United Kingdom, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man (and the use of a PO Box is not allowed). Nominet has also been [checking domains for valid contact details](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/about-domain-names/domain-lookup-whois/data-validation-status), so know that they'll disable and delete domains if your contact information cannot be validated. 

Also, owners of .CO.UK domains will have [priority access to their corresponding .UK domains] (http://www.dotuklaunch.co.uk/im-existing-customer) for five years. Because of this, many domains that are technically free will not appear in our site search, but if you are the current owner of a .CO.UK at iwantmyname and want your .UK too, please get in touch after June 10th and [we can help you out](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
