From Ben Pieratt's blog, in a post titled ["A 3-step process for naming a project/product. (And some resources)"](http://blog.pieratt.com/post/77293289254/a-3-step-process-for-naming-a-project-product-and):

> Naming a project is always an awful experience.
>
> An earworm that won’t stop tapping your skull from the inside. A tenacious pop jingle with teeth and a paycheck.
>
> As a freelance designer, I do a fair amount of this for clients. Generally, my process has been a garble of notes and trips to thesaurus.com, but lately I’ve noticed a fairly simple pattern emerging, a 3-step framework for cutting through the fog.

If you're looking to name your personal or business brand/project, this is a wonderful guide. It's short, concise and has a ton of great resources you can use to help you along the way (including iwantmyname... thanks Ben!).
