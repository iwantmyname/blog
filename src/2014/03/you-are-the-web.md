I imagine you have an email account. Possibly several. You've probably forgotten how many social media accounts you have. Might even have a few websites. That's pretty common. [Over a third](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm) of the [world's population](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) is online these days.

But do you consider _yourself_ a website? A web property? A network? Probably not. But that could change. Might be already. Our world is becoming ever more connected and networked, and the idea of people, tech, and the Internet itself all being separate entities is becoming an increasingly archaic one. 

Data we create online isn't just about our emailing and browsing habits anymore. It's not even just about computers or mobile phones. Our digital systems can include our cars, our appliances, and things we wear. All of these things are becoming more connected.

<!-- /excerpt -->

We are already aggregating our data in some relatively minor ways. There are smartphone apps that enable you to [interact with your car's diagnostics](http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/products/10-diagnostic-apps-and-devices-to-make-you-a-better-driver#slide-1). You can [tweet your Nike+ running progress](https://secure-nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/gps_app/). So it's not hard to imagine this trend continuing to evolve – each of us becoming a network of sorts, a nexus for all of our connected devices and data sources.

Connecting our accounts to a single, central hub from which we manage activities and data is convenient. We can see everything in one place. And, perhaps more importantly, larger and disparate data sets brought together can be more useful when analyzed. 

Now, one person's monitoring doesn't constitute "[Big Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)" but, for example, if you're a runner, looking at the metrics from all of your runs over several months will tell you a lot more about your progress than looking at the metrics for a couple of days. Now imagine combining your exercise data with the information about your diet over that time. 

Add in information about your health, mental state, stress levels, sleep patterns – the result is a pretty comprehensive view of how you're doing. And the person is just one facet. Imagine the same type of scenario for your home. Information on utilities usage, and the ability to control things like the thermostat remotely ([which you can already do](https://nest.com/)). Security systems, [smoke alarms](https://nest.com/smoke-co-alarm/life-with-nest-protect/) that automatically alert emergency services (again, these already exist). Even things like detecting water seepage around your house foundation or roof, a carbon monoxide leak, or a problem with your furnace. 

[Wearables can communicate with your environment, too.](http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/540977/internet_things_internet_jawbone_/) The opportunities to correct problems before they get bigger, or just see opportunities to do things more efficiently over time, are considerable. Your entire family could be part of that data hub.

How, then, will we display, manage, and analyze all of this information? Where will we keep it? An app? That doesn't provide a sense of 'address', really. The standard website doesn't seem to quite fit the bill, either. As much as we're used to the ubiquitous '.com', given that that actually refers to 'commerce', it makes much sense. 

We think this is an area of great opportunity for [the new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions). They describe vastly more things, places, and activities than '.com' or [other traditional gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains), and stretch our concepts of online 'addresses' or what a web _property_ is. (Especially given how much of our data is stored in the cloud.) 

We have very specific mental models of what .com / .net / .org mean. But much less so with .systems / .home / .works and the like. Not to mention that beyond the English language, there are plenty of culturally relevant terms and concepts that could be explored, like [.UNO for Spanish speakers](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/uno-looks-to-unite-the-spanish-speaking-web-an-interview-with-desiree-boxberger.html). What could be a more centralized 'address' for all your information than what translates as '.one'?

Keeping categories of my information tidy and centralized under my.home or my.car could be very handy. Or, if I wanted everything in one place, my.life. A lot of sci-fi and speculative fiction already places us in worlds where that sort of all-access data all the time culture is common place.

Like any other app or social network's settings, how much of that data we would choose to share or make public would be up to each person to decide. And while it could be invaluable to our doctors, mechanics, or contractors, it will also require a robust understanding and application of security measures.

But what we think of as 'online' and a 'website', or even 'content', is evolving. It will no longer just be a partial repository for some of our stuff, or a way to share cat pictures. As sensors become more accurate, devices more wearable, and reliable high-speed connections more ubiquitous, these things may become, to a considerable degree, a reflection of _us_. 

Who will you choose to be on that 'net?
