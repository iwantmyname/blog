<!-- excerpt -->

Technically, as of writing this post, the internet is sitting with 294,066 new gTLDs. And considering the first TLDs only started being offered for general availability in [early February](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html), the public reception has been quite nice. 

But it's not the steady growth that shocks me the most—it's the top of the list of TLDs that are doing best. Here's the current top 10 ([from ntldstats.com](http://ntldstats.com/)):

<!-- /excerpt -->

1. [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru)

	With so many great gTLDs out now (and so many more coming), it's hard to believe the sustained popularity of .GURU. Today, it makes up nearly 17% of all the new gTLDs on the web, and seems to be growing at a steady pace. 
	
	It's like though that something will eventually overtake .GURU on the gTLD list. The question is, what will it be?

3. [.TIPS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips)
4. [.TODAY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today)
5. [.TECHNOLOGY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology)
6. [.BERLIN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin)

	Location-based gTLDs are going to be a big deal. .BERLIN, .NYC, .LONDON—expect to see a few of these extensions on or near the top 10 once they are public.
7. [.DIRECTORY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-directory)
8. [.CLOTHING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing)
9. [.BIKE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike)
10. [.LAND](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-land)
