[From Max Knoblauch - Mashable:](http://mashable.com/2014/03/10/domain-names-history/)

>At the end of 1985, there were a whopping total of six domain names registered in the world. That number has expanded to 265 million names registered globally, according to Verisign's Q3 industry brief.

>As the world celebrates the web's 25th anniversary, it seems fitting to acknowledge the network addresses that help us navigate through the robustness of the Internet today.

From the first .COMs of 1985 to the massive gTLD launch of 2014, quite a bit has happened in the world of domain names. And Mashable catches some of the more interesting bits, like Mike Mann in 2012 registering nearly 15,000 domains in a single day—which may have had something to do with the internet [running out of four-letter .COMs](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/four-letter-coms-are-a-four-letter-wordgone.html) in 2013.
