[JFDI](http://jfdi.asia/) is a Singapore business incubator and co-working space widely regarded as the most successful digital venture accelerator in Asia. Earlier this week, they had a fantastic demo day and by all accounts the event was hugely successful with a fresh crop of [twelve start-ups](http://jfdi.asia/2014/07/07/twelve-startups-wow-global-investors-at-2014a-demo-day/) taking to the stage.

JFDI has an impressive track record and New Zealand founders have been ably represented in the recent past in the form of [TradeGecko](http://tradegecko.com/), which offers cloud hosted B2B inventory management software that provides greater transparency over stock control, purchasing and ordering for SMEs. The application integrates with other business services such as Xero, Vend and Shopify and includes a mobile CRM tool for busy sales staff. 

Success stories like that show why building out a wider start-up ecosystem network across Asia-Pacific is important for leveraging economic growth in the region. Singapore is a natural focus point given its proximity to China and ASEAN, and with its stated goal of becoming a "smart nation" through highly connected population and infrastructure. So I'm really looking forward to visiting next week and finding out more about the Singaporean tech start-up scene.

iwantmyname is sponsoring [JFDI's open house](http://jfdi.asia/openhouse/) on Friday 18th July at which there is always a warm invitation for creatives, geeks and entrepreneurs to attend and network. If you are a Singapore based customer of ours or want to find out more about what goes on at JFDI, please join us.
