title: Searching for domains at iwantmyname just got a lot faster

You rarely think about the cogs that make things work when you're browsing a site, but I'd like to direct your attention to our domain searchâ€”the big search bar on the homepage that lets you search for and buy domain names. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

The basic concept is a simple one. You type in a word, then our backend pings some servers and delivers a yes (available) or no (unavailable) for each top-level domain (TLD). A year ago, that wasn't such a big deal to manage, but once the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) launched, the search quickly became a lumbering hulk. Every time you ran a search, hundreds of TLDs needed to be checked at once, and timeouts became more and more common. 

So instead of just waiting for our search to implode, we decided to completely rework the system. We'll have a more technical post later on about what was accomplished, but the hyper-abridged version is that [the new search](https://iwantmyname.com/) is much faster and infinitely more stable. And that's a wonderful thing, because anything that gets in the way of you being able to register and manage domain names quickly is a big negative.
