First, some perspective. In order for the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to become mainstream, there needs to be a rapid rise in popularity. [1.4 million total registrations](http://ntldstats.com/) is a nice start (the new gTLD are only a few months old), but .com has 100 million domains under its umbrella. It's so big, in fact, that .com is synonymous with the internet for much of the world—but it may not always be that way. 

[.Xyz](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz), billed as the natural ending for everything (because it's the end of the alphabet), has hit the [250,000 domains registered mark](http://ntldstats.com/tld/xyz), now making up nearly 18% of all the new gTLDs in existance. There have been some pretty egregious instances of stat manipulation, but looking at the bigger picture, the rise of .xyz (and the fact that people are talking about it) makes it seem possible for a number of these gTLDs to catch on.

New gTLDs like [.app](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app), [.blog](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog) and [.web](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-web) are surefire hits that haven't come out yet, and the growing popularity of city gTLDs like [.berlin](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin) and [.tokyo](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo) are hopefully indicators of upcoming successes. The dream of seeing new gTLDs on billboards and ads and shows is still very much alive, it's just going to take some time—and .xyz's 250,000 is a great start.
