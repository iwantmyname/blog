[From Flavio Martins - DigiCert:](https://blog.digicert.com/expired-intermediate-certificate/)

> On July 26,2014 at 12:15 PM, some customers and users on sites secured by DigiCert reported that they were getting an untrusted certificate error.

> The problem is related to a locally installed legacy intermediate certificate that is no longer used and no longer required for the certificate installation. The problem can affect any client platform with a locally cached or installed intermediate certificate.

We use (and really like) DigiCert for SSL, but it looks like there's been a minor hiccup for some users. If you're getting an untrusted certificate error when you visit iwantmyname, this is a great (and easy) step-by-step guide on how to fix it.

And if you need any additional help, definitely [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
