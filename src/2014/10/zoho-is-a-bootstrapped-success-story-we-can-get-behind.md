<!-- excerpt -->

From PandoDaily, in an article titled "[Anti-burn: How bootstrapped Zoho survived two tech bubbles and became a massive success](http://pando.com/2014/10/14/anti-burn-how-bootstrapped-zoho-survived-two-tech-bubbles-and-became-a-massive-success/)":

>Silicon Valley has been up in arms of late over burn rates. With private companies raising larger rounds at higher valuations than ever before and chasing broader market opportunities than possible in the past, it’s no surprise that entrepreneurs are spending at an unprecedented rate to grow as fast as they can. But, despite these understandable circumstances, several of the industry’s most respected investors have raised a red flag on the issue, arguing that it’s a symptom of good times company building that could leave a ton of companies dangerously exposed when market conditions inevitably shift.

>For those arguing that spending with reckless abandon is the only way to build the kind of massive, high value businesses that the venture model demands, there are counterpoints available across the Valley. One such business is Zoho, the 18-year-old enterprise software company that has bootstrapped itself to hundreds of millions in revenue, and profitability.

As an active user of Zoho Mail (Zoho Mail, Discussions, Sites, and Wiki are all in our [one-click marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services)) , I'll say two things:

1. The Zoho platform is extremely easy to use, and I almost always recommend it to friends over Google Apps. Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but I generally like to go with platforms that have straightforward business models. Zoho sells solutions, Google sells data.
2. Being a bootstrapped company ourselves, we love companies that are in control of their own destiny. Here's a good quote from the PandoDaily article— "When companies grow too fast they never figure out management and cultural issues, they just pile on layers of management,” Vembu says. “We just learned on the job – trial by fire. We made lots of mistakes, but no major ones. That’s the good thing, when you’re small, you can correct them. And the process of making mistakes is crucial to the process of learning. Besides, most VCs today have never built a company. They’re mostly MBAs, with at best one exit. And survivorship bias means they’ve probably never navigated a recession anyway.”
