title: Time to do some hacking on DuckDuckGo

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) has long been one of our favorite search engines, and given the amount of programmers and developers we have in our community, it's probably one of your favorites, too. (If you're not using it, give DuckDuckGo a shot. Unlike Google/Bing, DDG doesn't collect or share any personal information, and ads really are kept to a minimum.)

And now, DuckDuckGo is letting the community "hack the search engine."

>For coders: DuckDuckHack is the best way to use your skills to help make DuckDuckGo a better search engine and a great way to get started in open-source.

If you're interested, head on over to [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com/) and check out the slick new landing page. And don't be afraid to pitch in—I'd love to see their underdog search engine get bigger and better.
