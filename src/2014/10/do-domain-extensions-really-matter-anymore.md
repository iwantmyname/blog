From Pando Daily, in an article titled ["What’s In A Name? The fading tyranny of dot com"](http://pando.com/2014/10/09/whats-in-a-name-the-fading-tyranny-of-dot-com/):

>For someone like Michael Heyward, who co-founded anonymous social networking app Whisper in 2012, as a mobile first company, he says, there was not an ounce of trepidation at not having the Whisper.com domain name. (Whisper.com itself is a junk address, filled with spam links.)

>Heyward says that 99 percent of Whisper’s exposure comes from its app. The company has a Whisper.sh landing page, to showcase popular posts from the app and publish legal and company information.

>In 2014, Americans spend more time in apps than they do using the Internet on desktop. With social media sites becoming a greater engine for content discovery, new sites such as Quartz are popping up that don’t really even have an official homepage.

Speaking of the declining need for .com addresses, I was driving home on the freeway this morning and saw a giant billboard that read something like:

+ Save big on auto and home insurance
+ Call xxxxxxxxxx
+ VerbBrandNameAdverb.TLD

Now imagine me, cruising down the road at 75 mph (120 kph), glancing up at a billboard to memorize not only a phone number, but an excessively long domain name because the company refused to use anything but .com. 

A savvy marketing manager would advise them to shorten that domain in any way possible, but a really savvy marketing manager would tell them to nix the website from the billboard altogether. If you have three seconds to get a message across, the primary goal is to get the brand name to stick. If the brand name sticks, people (even the internet-phobic) will find you on Google.

I can probably count the number of times I've typed in a full domain name this week on one hand. Search, social, links—that's how people get around.

One last thought. I was at an event the other day, and someone asked me where I worked. The crowd wasn't particularly tech savvy, so I figured saying "iwantmyname" would raise some eyebrows. Instead, I said "I work for a domain registrar called iwantmyname—you should check out our site!" Reflexively, the guy pulled out his phone and typed in "iwantmyname." A click later, and there he was. 

Notice that I didn't need to say, "I work for iwantmyname... go to www.iwantmyname.com." If you have a memorable brand name and a website, people will find you.
