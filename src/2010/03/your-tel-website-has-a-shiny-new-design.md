title: "Your .TEL Domain's Website Has A Shiny New Design"
----

The [.TEL top-level domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tel-domain-name-registration-for-communication), an easy way to publish contact information online, has just released a new design for all users. Your domain name's website can now be customized with different color schemes and your personal avatar, photo or logo. If you enter links to your Twitter, Facebook profile or other services it also shows custom icons when your .TEL page is loaded.

This is how our company .TEL website [ideegeo.tel](http://ideegeo.tel) looks like:

.TEL is a simple and affordable solution to own and manage a website without the need of having additional webhosting. You can even [update your contact information and location from your iPhone](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/03/mytel-iphone-app-now-integrates-with-domainapp.html). The new design and personalization options make .TEL pages much more interesting for both individuals and businesses.

Check if your personal or company name is still available with our [domain search](https://iwantmyname.com).
