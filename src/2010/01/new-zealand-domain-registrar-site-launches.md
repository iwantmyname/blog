title: Kiwi iwantmyname Domain Registrar Site Launches
----

With the successful launch of iwantmyname as a [global domain registrar](https://iwantmyname.com) site and then into [Germany](http://meinname.com) and the [Netherlands](http://benikvrij.nl) last year, we felt it was now time to turn our attention to home. We have had so many requests from our friends to establish in the New Zealand market, because of our unique service offering, friendly user interface and great customer support. Finally we had to say yes and we now have a dedicated Kiwi site at [https://iwantmyname.co.nz](https://iwantmyname.co.nz) offering fixed prices in New Zealand dollars.

The Kiwi iwantmyname has New Zealand's widest range of [domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains), many of which are unavailable from other local domain registrars. Examples of exclusive domains include the recently launched .TEL and .ME suffixes plus interesting country code top-level domains from all over the world such as .LI (Liechtenstein), .IO (British Indian Ocean Territory) and .FM (Federal States of Micronesia). Customers from the existing site can use the same login details to access their accounts across the iwantmyname platform suite. We also offer the same [free services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) on our Kiwi version so that you can hook up your own domain to customise a wide range of great web applications such as GMail, Blogger and Zoho. In the very near future we also plan to add some cool new Kiwi-made services that we really want to support.

We think it is appropriate that the launch of a new product should be celebrated with some special offers. So until the end of February we are offering new .COM, .NET, .ORG and .NAME domains for only $19.90 NZD plus .INFO for $9.90 NZD. We are also able to offer a FREE one year extension if you [transfer your existing domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) across to iwantmyname NZ. Transfers can be handled from your personal dashboard once you [join up](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin). Please note that all domain prices quoted on the Kiwi site are GST exclusive and that we provide full GST invoicing to all our valued customers.

In addition, we are supporting the Australasian Linux conference [LCA2010](http://lca2010.org.nz) which rolls into our hometown Wellington on 18-23 January. Look out for the iwantmyname crew at our stand at the Open Day on Saturday 23rd. We would be happy to demo the new site and discuss how we are supporting the open source movement and other technology communities in New Zealand.
