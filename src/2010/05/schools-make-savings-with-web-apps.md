title: Kiwi Schools Make Savings With Web Apps
----

We recently implemented the **.school.nz** domain on the [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) platform and it's great to see some Kiwi schools have quickly identified the cost saving benefits. iWantMyName offers a unique [web apps customisation service](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) that allows organisations and individuals to operate a wide range of popular web-based enterprise applications entirely within their own domain.

Now schools can benefit from major productivity gains associated with utilising free or low cost web apps such as [blogs](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting), [website builders](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder) and [webmail](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting), whilst protecting their brand identity online. Using web apps means fewer software overheads, better security and less maintenance for school I.T. administrators. For schools that [transfer](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/school.nz-domain-registrar-transfer-new-zealand) across their existing domain there is a free one year extension.
