title: Pukekos and Pongas

We didn't manage to spot any pukekos in ponga trees on the First Day of Christmas, but otherwise it has certainly been quite a year of achievements at [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/). Not only did we refine our service offering by overhauling the technology, but we also delivered seamless and straightforward domain management to many new Kiwi customers through the launch of our New Zealand domain registrar site. Even better, we were able to contribute to our local community with tech talks, [event sponsorships](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/09/family-fun-forecast-for-software-freedom-day.html) and behind the scenes project management support for some very [cool events](http://up.org.nz/media/news/wellington_to_the_world_2010_review) promoting technology entrepreneurship.

Having successfully rolled out our registrar technology into four markets globally we have begun to turn our attention to finding [new partnerships](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/10/domain-registrar-solution.html). Got web industry or hosting experience and want to operate your own branded version of iWantMyName? No problem. The domain industry withstood the "Great Recession" throughout 2010 and continues to grow at more than 7% per annum with over 200 million domains. The current market leaders have been slow to innovate but are now looking to exit at high valuations. We think this will create a huge amount of buzz in our industry in 2011.

It's time now to take a few days off and play at the beach, enjoy some good food and drink and spend time with family. But our domain elves will still be keeping an eye on things. Please [get in touch](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) if we can help in any way.

**Thanks so much to everyone who signed up with us in 2010. Best wishes for a safe and happy Christmas holiday and a choice New Year!**
