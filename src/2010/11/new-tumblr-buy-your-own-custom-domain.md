###5 reasons why you should buy your own domain name for Tumblr:

- YourName.com is a shorter web address than yourname.tumblr.com
- Use custom email addresses @yourname.com with your domain
- Not happy with Tumblr? Keep the domain and switch to another service
- Helps you to rank better in Google so that people can find you easily
- And last but not least - you can own a domain name, it's all yours!

With iWantMyName, it's dead-easy to register your domain name and set it up for your Tumblr page. Feel free to share this Tumblr custom domain promotion with your friends.
