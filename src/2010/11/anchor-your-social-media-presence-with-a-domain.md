Mashable just published an excellent [summary](http://mashable.com/2010/11/28/small-business-resources/) of its recent best articles on how small business can leverage social media. Whether it be using [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/iwantmyname-NZ/118040718222943), working with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz) or learning how to get a [mobile app](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone) for your business, it's a great set of resources. But it is important to remember that your domain is the brand anchor for all these services - choose wisely.

Some social media [services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) allow you to use your own personal domain. Tumblr is a [good example](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/10/tell-us-your-tumblr-tales.html) of this and is an attractive, easy-to-use blogging service that is quick to set up. The beauty of owning and managing your domain is that you have complete control. Even if you need to change services, your domain remains constant. Improving your search ranking takes time and effort; owning your domain minimises the risk of falling into a black hole if you move house.

Another consideration for small business is the ownership and protection of intellectual property. We heard of a case where a couple set up and grew a successful online business selling clothing. Sadly when the relationship ended, one party had complete control over the domain, hosting and content management and simply shut down the entire operation. Although the website brand and domain was actually the real life name of the aggrieved party, there was no legal recourse. Insisting on domain ownership and [filing a trademark](http://www.iponz.govt.nz/cms/trade-marks/trade-marks-homepage) would have prevented a lot of heart break.

[iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) has the widest range of domains available in New Zealand and is simply the best place to start your search for the perfect domain to anchor your online presence.
