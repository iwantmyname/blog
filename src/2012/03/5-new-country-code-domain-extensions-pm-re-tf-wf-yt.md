This week we have added five new country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) for you to [register at iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions). The domain extensions [.PM (St Pierre et Miquelon)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pm-domain-name-registration-for-saint-pierre-and-miquelon), [.RE (Réunion)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/re-french-domain-name-registration-for-reunion), [.TF (French Southern Territories)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tf-domain-name-registration-for-french-southern-territories), [.WF (Wallis and Futuna)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/wf-wallisian-futunan-domain-name-registration-for-wallis-and-futuna) and [.YT (Mayotte)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/yt-mahoran-domain-name-registration-for-mayotte) belong to [France](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france) and are managed by [AFNIC](http://afnic.fr), the French registry.

.PM, .RE, .TF, .WF and .YT domains can be registered by anybody worldwide at a yearly price of $49.00 which includes the required local address in the European Union. We also offer [domain transfers in these French extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) without you losing any previously paid term at your current registrar.
