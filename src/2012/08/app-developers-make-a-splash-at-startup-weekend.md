title: "App Developers: Make A Splash At Startup Weekend"

The next New Zealand Startup Weekend has rolled around and we hear that the [Palmerston North event](http://palmynorth.startupweekend.org/) is almost sold out already. That's a testament to all of the organisers, sponsors and media that have got behind the global initiative and especially to all the participants who played so far. Startup Weekend makes entrepreneurial education fun and interactive which is fantastic because we need to boost and celebrate entrepreneurial culture more than ever before.

Naturally we are right behind Palmy Startup Weekend, in the same way we backed every other event since [Startup Weekend first arrived](http://unlimited.co.nz/unlimited.nsf/leadership/the-2012-influencers-the-hustler) here. We're co-sponsoring drinks at the launch party and providing a free .COM, NET, .ORG or .NZ [domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) for each team that goes forward from Friday evening. We are also co-sponsoring a juicy $1000 [Mix&Mash prize](http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/competitions) for the best open data app. So get thinking about what kind of apps you can build that transform and add value to government data in some way.
