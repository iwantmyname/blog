title: How To Make An Online Shop That Rocks

Lower Hutt web designer and rock fan Dave Keyes recently decided to combine his passions by launching an [e-commerce website](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting/) to distribute rock themed clothing and gifts. Part of the profits go to the Cancer Society of New Zealand, so we figured [thisisatribute.com](http://archived.link/http://thisisatribute.com/) was the perfect candidate for our November website of the month.

Dave recently became a Dad, so it's no surprise that designer-wear for junior rockers are featured prominently on the site. We think the "Red Hot Chilli" [jump suits](http://archived.link/http://thisisatribute.com/collections/baby-rock/products/rock-colours-baby-one-piece) are cute as a button, so if you have fashionable friends with newborns, you should definitely point them in this direction. Prints, badges and tee shirts are also available.

The site was built using [hosted online shop builder Shopify](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software). iwantmyname makes it easy to customise a Shopify web store front with your own domain. Setting up a simple online sales site is easy these days and a great, low cost way to test the market with a new product line.
