It's been a long time coming but the [dot Kiwi registry bid](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/01/dot-kiwi-domain-takes-flight.html) to launch the new .kiwi domain has been approved by internet regulatory body ICANN. The organisation opened the door for listings of new generic top level domains (gTLDs) in 2012 and almost 2000 applications were received. ICANN has been steadily working its way through the huge pile of submissions and recently gave the green light to .kiwi . 

Offshore based New Zealander and Dot Kiwi CEO Tim Johnson expects the new extension to open up the domain space in New Zealand and provide more choice for domain fans and businesses frustrated with other more traditional but somewhat congested domains. The new domain will be open to everyone globally, but the trust taking care of the new gTLD will be donating a portion of .kiwi sales revenue towards post quake rebuilding efforts in Christchurch. The New Zealand domain landscape could expand even further with a proposal now under [consultation](http://www.domainpulse.com/2013/06/13/nz-second-level-registrations/) regarding creating a .nz "second level" domain.

The sunrise period for the .kiwi domain could begin as early as September, meaning that businesses and individuals with protected brands will be eligible to reserve domains in accordance with ICANN procedure. Public registrations should be on offer a little later in the year. Of course it makes sense to register your .kiwi domain with iwantmyname New Zealand's [coolest global domain registrar](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/).
