<!-- excerpt -->

It's an exciting time in the domain world, as hundreds of new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) are coming in the near future. Right now, [our catalog is up to 481](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), and that number may rise as more are announced. 

But before each gTLD is [official](http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings), they must "pass a rigorous evaluation process" through [ICANN](http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/) to "ensure a safe, secure and measured rollout." This rollout has been slow, but persistent--and now three additional TLDs have been delegated.

+ [.MENU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-menu)
+ [.UNO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-uno)
+ [.みんな](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-みんな) - Japanese for "everyone"

We're thrilled to see these official announcements come through, but know that no launch dates have been set. Once we have more information, we'll be sure to pass it along.

And if .MENU, .UNO, and .みんな aren't what you're looking for, [check out our full list of gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) and pre-order the one that's right for you.
