title: New Domain Extensions Added In 2013
----

We thought it would be fitting for the last post of 2013 to reflect on the top-level domains (TLDs) that have joined the iwantmyname family this year. So without further ado and in chronological order, here we go: 

1. [.GR](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/02/greece-is-the-word-gr-rebuilds.html):
> The Greek top-level domain is the most popular choice in the South European country and also makes for neat [domain hacks of words ending in 'gr'](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-greek-domain-name-registration-for-greece).

2. [.CA](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/o-canada-your-home-and-native-domain-yes-we-do-offer-ca-now.html):
> It's been a long time in the making but we're very proud to introduce the [Canadian top-level domain .CA at iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada)! It is now available for registration at an affordable $19 USD/yr.

3. [.PW](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/pw-domains-now-available.html):
> We have now enabled support for the [.PW suffix](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pw-palauan-domain-name-registration-for-palau) which is the official country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Palau. The sovereign nation is located in the Pacific Ocean and part of the the island group of Micronesia.

4. [(.COM).AU](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/going-across-the-ditch-you-can-now-register-au-domains-at-your-favourite-registrar.html):
> Being based in New Zealand, it was always on our roadmap to offer the top-level domain (TLD) of our Australian friends. We know that many of you have been waiting for this TLD since a very long time and it's our absolute pleasure to finally be able to announce the addition of the [.COM.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia), [.NET.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia), [.ORG.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) and [.ID.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/id.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) extensions to our domain family.

5. [(.COM).AR](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/comar-a-tld-lionel-messi-would-be-proud-of.html):
> Making up nearly all of southern South America, Argentina is an amazing cultural treasure, known for great soccer (fútbol), proud gauchos, some of the best beef and wine on Earth, and beautiful cities filled with European-inspired architecture. And now you can own a piece of Argentina with our newest domain extension--[.COM.AR](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.ar-argentinean-domain-name-registration-for-argentina).

6. [.CL](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/its-time-to-claim-a-chilean-domain.html):
 > Let's talk a bit about Chile, home of our newest ccTLD, [.CL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cl-chilean-domain-name-registration-for-chile). Hugging the western coast of South America, Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, known for towering mountains, stunning fjords and some of the best wine on the planet. (It's also the fictional home of Gus Fring, but I'm sure they don't advertise it.)

7. [.MY](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/my-new-malaysian-domain-extension.html):
> And now you can own a small bit of Malaysia yourself with a [.MY domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/my-malaysian-domain-name-registration-for-malaysia), perfect for local businesses, organizations and anyone with a great .MY domain hack up their sleeves (wham.my, anyone?). Get yours today!

We can't wait to add more top-level domains in 2014 and with dozens of [new generic TLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) launching throughout the year (or countries like [United Kingdom](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/uk-domains-without-the-co-coming-summer-2014.html) and New Zealand [dropping the '.co' part](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/its-time-to-drop-the-conz-pre-ordering-starts-today.html)), it will certainly be busy around the iwantmyname office. But now let's kick back and relax for a day or two first. Have a happy New Years everyone!
