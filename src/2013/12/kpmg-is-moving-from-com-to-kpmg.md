[From WIPR:](http://www.worldipreview.com/article/kpmg-migrating-from-com)

> "As the primary signal for our brand's Internet addressing, .kpmg will replace kpmg.com," explains David Green, head of global digital marketing at the firm, which operates in more than 155 countries and employs close to 155,000 people.
>
> "The time it takes to get to that stage will depend on general public awareness of the gTLD programme," Green notes. "We won't immediately drop .com; there will be a phased migration."
>
> KPMG's application states that the .kpmg domain will act as a "clear signpost" for Internet users to genuine KPMG domains and associated content. "It will therefore increase consumer and client trust and reduce the possibility of malicious conduct. It may also allow us to engage with Internet users in their native language, creating a more positive user experience," the application states.

We've written quite a bit about [generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) categorizing the web](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-guru-clothing-gallery-graphics-and-more.html), but this is the first example of a major corporation making the switch. And what a switch it is, as KPMG is one of the world's largest tax and advisory firms with nearly 155,000 employees.

Soon, a number of large companies who have applied for custom gTLDs will have URLs you can trust to be legitimate. For the average consumer, the .KPMG switch won't be noticed, but imagine having trusted bank TLDs like .CHASE in America and .ANZ here in New Zealand. In one stroke, consumers will instantly be able to identify illegitimate sites, emails and mailers from their domain extensions alone. Simply for fraud detection, this is a big win for the internet.

But categorizing the web doesn't necessarily take a custom-branded TLD--there are hundreds of new gTLDs rolling out in 2014 we can all use such as [.DOCTOR](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-doctor), [.APP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app) and [.RADIO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-radio). [Pre-orders are open now](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), so get your name on the list before the gTLDs officially go live.
