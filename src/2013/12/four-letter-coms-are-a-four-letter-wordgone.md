[From Will Oremus - Slate:](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/12/04/four_letter_domain_names_zero_unclaimed_llll_dot_coms_left_on_the_internet.html)

> We're not just talking about four-letter names that spell actual words, like cars.com or pets.com (R.I.P). We're not even just talking about pronounceable four-letter combinations, like eBay, Yelp, Etsy, and Hulu. We're talking every possible four-letter combination, from aaaa.com to zzzz.com. That's a total of 456,976 combinations. [WhoAPI](http://whoapi.com/blog/1413/we-are-out-of-4-letter-com-domains/) checked all 456,976 of them, and confirmed that not one remains unregistered.

Good thing the new generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) are coming soon. With hundreds to choose from, there will be plenty of great four-letter options available.

And if you have one in mind, [pre-orders for many of the new gTLDs are open now](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions). Go take a look.
