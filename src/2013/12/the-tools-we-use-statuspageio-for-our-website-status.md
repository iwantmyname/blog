The only thing worse than visiting a site that's not running correctly is being responsible for it. But the inevitable truth is that things go wrong sometimes. And when they do, it's important to be transparent with your customers and always keep them informed. 

And that's why we use [StatusPage.io](https://www.statuspage.io) for site status updates. Using StatusPage.io, we've created a [branded status page](http://status.iwantmyname.com) to inform our customers of errors/outages in different parts of our site (website, domain search, customer dashboard, DNS hosting and order processing). With built-in automated Twitter integration, StatusPage.io also acts as a secondary status platform when up-to-the-minute messaging is critical to your customers.

What makes StatusPage.io even more helpful though is its integration with our internal chat app, [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com). With native HipChat integration, everyone at iwantmyname receives status updates when things go wrong, so we're always on the same page with community management and workflow. And as the [HipChat post announcing the integration](http://blog.hipchat.com/2013/12/04/integrate-statuspage-io-with-hipchat/) suggests, "Now, everyone in the company can stay up-to-date during an unplanned outage or scheduled maintenance without interrupting the engineers who are working to restore services."

So if you're interested in how our site is performing, check out out page at [status.iwantmyname.com](http://status.iwantmyname.com). We're extremely happy with our new status setup and would certainly recommend StatusPage.io to any service-based company with a web platform.
