This week we welcome .GR as the first addition to our portfolio of domain extensions in 2013! The Greek top-level domain is the most popular choice in the South European country and also makes for neat domain hacks of words ending in 'gr'.

You can [register .GR domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-greek-domain-name-registration-for-greece) at an affordable $49.00/yr. However, please note that new .gr domains have a minimum registration period of 2 years. We also accept [.gr domain transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-domain-registrar-transfer-greece) from other registrars to iwantmyname and they are completely free of charge too! There are no local restrictions meaning any individual, company or organization worldwide can [register Greece's web address](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gr-greek-domain-name-registration-for-greece).
