We haven't talked about Wordpress much in the past, but we're big fans of using Markdown for writing on the web. And now, we're happy to learn that WordPress.com is adopting Markdown as a formatting option.

[From Matt Wiebe at WordPress:](http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/markdown/)

> Markdown has arrived on WordPress.com! Some of you may respond with "Finally!" Others might be asking, "what's that?" Markdown is a quick way to add formatted text without writing out any HTML.

And in case you're interested in some details, 

> Markdown nerds (like me!) know there are a lot of variants out there. On WordPress.com, we're using a slightly modified version of [Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/), with a tweak to allow fenced code blocks inspired by [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

P.S. It's easy to use your domains with a hosted blog at WordPress.com. Simply get their custom domain add-on and update the nameservers in your iwantmyname dashboard by selecting it from the popular hosts dropdown menu.
