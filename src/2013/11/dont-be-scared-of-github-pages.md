----

[From Lauren Orsini - ReadWrite:](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained)

> People use GitHub to host projects ranging from music composition to cookbooks to municipal data. But what you might not know is that GitHub isn't just a storage locker, but also a showcase. That is, GitHub allows you to set up a bare-bones website you can use to display projects and collaborate.

The world of development, and certainly GitHub, is extremely intimidating for novice site creators. But it doesn't have to be. As the articles subtitle reads, GitHub Pages is "like GitHub with training wheels, it's an easier way to code open source." Anyone can learn, and the link above is a great place to start.

And of course, once you're ready, don't forget to pick up a [good domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/github-pages-custom-domain). We like to think it's the most important part.
