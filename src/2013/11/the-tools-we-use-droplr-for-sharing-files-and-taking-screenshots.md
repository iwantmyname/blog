title: "The Tools We Use: Droplr For Sharing Files And Taking Screenshots"
----

For a bigger, more updated look at Droplr, head over to our new post, "[Droplr is an exceptionally useful tool for sharing files and screenshots](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/08/droplr-is-an-exceptionally-useful-tool.html)".

<!-- excerpt -->

Before [Droplr](https://droplr.com/hello), this was a pretty typical conversation:

"Hey, take a look at the box in the bottom right corner of your screen."
"Oh, I'm on my phone. I think I'm seeing something different."

or...

"Do you see what's happening on this page?"
"No, it's not happening on my browser."

There are a million reasons why someone would need to send a screenshot, and with Droplr, there's now an incredibly easy way to send one.

<!-- /excerpt -->

Using the Droplr Mac, Windows or iOS App (or a number of [third-party apps](https://droplr.com/hello#)), taking a screenshot is as easy as hitting a hotkey combo, drawing a box anywhere on the screen, then sharing the URL Droplr provides of the image you took. You can also use Droplr to shorten links in your browser, write and share PlainText/Markdown drafts of documents, share code and send large files with Droplr and send them to anyone you please. 

Truth be told, it may be the easiest platform for sharing files on the internet, ever.

And for $5.99/mo, [Droplr Pro](https://droplr.com/hello#pro) gives you advanced statistics, the ability to share files up to 1GB and custom domains for the files you send. For a business, sending links with custom short domain names (like iwmn.me) is always nice touch of authenticity.
