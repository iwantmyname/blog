The iwantmyname team just got back from a two-week stay in Fiji where we spent time together working, brainstorming and dreaming big. Why Fiji, you ask? As you may know, our company is based in New Zealand, and the Pacific island nation is just a short 2.5 hour flight from here, making it an affordable destination for a team outing. One of our goals when launching iwantmyname almost 5 years ago was to set up the company in a way so that we could work completely independent of our location (as long as there's an internet connection), so we wanted to put our goal to the test.

On Oct 13 we left on two separate flights from Auckland to Nadi, Fiji. Our first stop after landing was a local telco shop at the airport to buy local SIM cards for data. The plan was to set up our own wireless network over 3G and use simple tethering via our phones as a backup option. As you can imagine, good internet connectivity is crucial for us, so a side reason for picking Fiji is because of their direct connection to an undersea data cable.

The tools we used to create our own network were two [Sapido MB-1132 3G/4G travel routers](http://www.sapido.com.tw/EN/productmb1132o_35g.htm) with [Huawei E372 USB sticks](http://www.huaweidevice.com/worldwide/productFeatures.do?pinfoId=2940&directoryId=5008&treeId=582&tab=0) connected to an external antenna, which gave us enough bandwidth to do work. We've been using the same setup all over New Zealand while traveling, camping and backpacking already, and Vodafone Fiji didn't disappoint with their 3G speed. Prices were reasonable too, with ~$40 USD for 6 GB of data, which you could top up online.

With everything in place, we kicked off our first week just as if we were at our normal office. The only difference was the warm weather, the pool and the ocean waves just in front of our house, which we made use of extensively.

Need a break in Fiji? Just jump in the pool or go for a swim, snorkle or kayak in the crystal-clear ocean. This helped us tremendously to get our minds off the tasks we planned to achieve during our stay (e.g. after staring at a screen for hours, writing complicated code or fixing bugs). The main goal for this trip was to automate the last bits and pieces of our system, improve internal admin tools and performing some cleanup tasks. Quite often our workflow looked like "git push > deploy > jump in pool". It was such an intense, focused and productive two weeks, and having the team in a beautiful and relaxed work environment certainly made a big difference.

Of course we also explored the island, with the highlight being a hiking trip to a local waterfall. Check out the video:

Unfortunately, some of us got sick after trying some local specialties in week two, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the rest of our stay. I'd say on a tropical island it just adds to the experience... ;) 

We had clear goals that we wanted to achieve and we hit most of them. But more importantly, the team got closer to each other by sharing rooms, cooking meals together and just having a good time. It went so well, we're planning to go on team outings like this on a yearly basis now. Would we go to Fiji again? Certainly! It's close to New Zealand, affordable and offers good internet connectivity for a remote island.
