At iwantmyname we have a growing following amongst the creative community who love the idea of customising an online portfolio site with their chosen domain name. Once you [purchase a domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/), it is a simple step to select the required [hosted portfolio app](https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/) and click to automagically add the correct DNS settings on the domain. Voila!

It is so much easier these days to get a collection of art, photography or design work posted online because of the many high quality hosted [website builder](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/) and [online portfolio services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/) that are available. [22Slides](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration) is a new portfolio app that is getting a lot of attention lately. Here's a [beautiful example](http://anishbabuverghese.com/) 
of a 22Slides[](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/22slides-domain-registration) site that has been domain customised. The artist uses a 
dramatic photographic slideshow to draw in viewers and then subtly markets her 
global design consultancy offering with further examples of artwork and 
past commercial projects.

Artists and designers are attracting greater global interest in their work and securing actual paid contracts by exposing their creativity to a much wider audience. Promoting your art or design work online is a smart move for building reputation and customising your web address with a preferred domain name is the way to go for better visibility. It's also easy to add other services such as [hosted email](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting/) or a [blog](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/) on the same domain. [Get started](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/) with a portfolio app and new domain name today.
