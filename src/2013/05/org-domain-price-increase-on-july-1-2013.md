The .ORG domain manager [Public Interest Registry](http://pir.org) (PIR) recently announced that they will be increasing their annual registration fee for registrars on July 1, 2013. Unfortunately, we have to pass on this registry price change and our registration/renewal fee for [.ORG domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation) will increase from $14.90/yr to $15.50/yr accordingly.

It's been our philosophy to reduce domain prices as we grow, wherever possible. We absorbed many increases in registry fees for gTLDs (generic top-level domains, e.g. .COM, .NET or .ORG) over the last few years. This is the first time in our company history that we are passing on a gTLD price increase imposed by the registry. We hope for your understanding in this matter. Rest assured that we aim to continue our mission to deliver outstanding customer service and building the [best domain management service on the market](https://iwantmyname.com).
