title: How To Track Customer Service Happiness
----

We pride ourselves in excellent customer support and have recently started tracking people's satisfaction with our email replies using a tool called [NiceReply](http://nicereply.com). Implementing their service was as easy as creating an account and placing a link in the footer of every support answer. They've got integrations with popular help desks such as Desk.com or Zendesk which even allows you to link customer support feedback to each case and team member.

After four weeks of receiving votes, here's the verdict from iwantmyname customers:

[![iwantmyname-customer-support.png](/media/2013-07-24-iwantmyname-customer-support.png)](http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname)

This metric part of a public profile page (see our [iwantmyname results](http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname)) where you can publish any comments left by your customers. If you don't include [testimonials or reviews](https://iwantmyname.com/about) on your website, it's an easy way to show prospects what to expect.

It is also great for your customer service team to keep morale up. We regularly share the feedback internally in our office chat room. And who wouldn't love to hear comments like:

- *"you guys rock. I've been a customer for less than 24 hours and already you've helped me a ton!"*
- *"I wish more companies were as good as you guys are at quick helpful responses."*
- *"great help as usual form a great company to work with"*
- *"10 minute turnaround -- super impressive!"*
- *"Well done. Thanks for the quick service, and the politeness was appreciated for a transfer out."*

Thanks to our customers for such kind words!
