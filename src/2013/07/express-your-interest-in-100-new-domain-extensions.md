With over 250 million domain names currently registered globally, you may be wondering just why there's a need for more internet real estate in the form of newly announced top level domains (TLDs). But let's put that number in perspective. There's already around 2.4 billion internet users now and that number continues to expand rapidly. The cost for individual users to create a personal presence on the web is dropping all the time as the cost of hosting has become a commodity and the quality of [online website builder services](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder) has improved markedly. So it's a safe bet a lot more people out there will be needing a web address in the future. There's still plenty of room for growth.

Astonishingly, over 100 million of the currently existing domains sit within a single popular domain extension that we all know of as [.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial). That's top dog amongst the twenty or so generic top level domains (gTLDs) that have been the mainstay of internet domain addressing for almost thirty years now. Rounding out the mix are more than 200 two letter country code domains (ccTLD). But the field is set to expand to cater for both organic growth and the needs of businesses that want their owned branded domain.

Last year internet governing body ICANN opened the door for new domain applications and received hundreds of responses. Many of these applicants such as [.APP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app), [.BLOG](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog) or [.NYC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc) now have provisional approval, so the web landscape is now wide open for property development &mdash; so to speak. We will let you know as more information comes to hand for each domain, so check out the new domains that interest you and [sign up to express your interest today](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions).
