title: Simplified Custom Domain Setup For Windows Azure And Other Microsoft Apps
----

We're continuing on our mission to make configuring domains easier. A new [Microsoft category](https://iwantmyname.com/services/microsoft) in the iwantmyname marketplace exemplifies this philosophy by offering simple configuration of the most popular Microsoft hosting services. If you're looking to set up a domain with [Windows Azure Cloud Services](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-custom-domain-registration-setup), [Windows Azure Websites](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-websites-custom-domain) or [Windows Live (Outlook.com)](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/windows-live-custom-domain) you can now do it in just one click.

Here's how it works for new domains:

1. Start a domain search for your [app](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-custom-domain-registration-setup), [website](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/windows-azure-websites-custom-domain) or [email](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/windows-live-custom-domain)
2. Purchase the domain &mdash; you can choose from [100+ international extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions)
3. Add the selected Microsoft hosting service after finishing your order and we'll do our DNS magic

If you haven't used Outlook.com yet &mdash; I'd encourage you to. It's a great [free alternative to Gmail](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/) and offers a clean, new take on email while being just as powerful as other services that are out there. Also make sure to definitely check out Microsoft's Windows Azure Websites offering which allows you to create a site with a few clicks using open source apps like WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, DotNetNuke or Umbraco. 

When you're ready to set up a Microsoft service, head over to the iwantmyname marketplace and [customize your web address now](https://iwantmyname.com/services/microsoft).
