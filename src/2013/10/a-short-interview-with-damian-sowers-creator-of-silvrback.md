**iwmn:** Hi Damian. Thanks so much for chatting with us. First off, tell me a bit about yourself and why you started [Silvrback](https://www.silvrback.com/).

**Damian:** Hi Chris. Thanks for having me. 

I started Silvrback to scratch my own itch, so to speak. I really liked the format of Medium, but I disliked a number of things about Medium. Namely, it wasn't really a blogging platform and I had no ownership over my data and the flow of users. For example, Medium often directs people to other author's articles after they are done reading your piece. 

I also liked certain aspects of Svbtle. So I decided to build a bit of a hybrid system between the two platforms. The goal was to allow people to promote themselves more effectively while providing a beautiful experience for the reader.

**iwmn:** Content ownership (or ownership in general) is a big deal to us, but what, in your mind, makes ownership such a big priority?

**Damian:** Content ownership is becoming something that more and more users are caring about these days. The legal agreements of many Apps, including Medium, are murky to say the least. If someone is going to spend the time writing an article, they should feel confident that they actually own their own writing. Silvrback gives full ownership to it's users and the legal agreement is extremely simple and easy to digest. 

**iwmn:** Speaking of Medium, it seems that blogs all over the web are quickly moving towards clean, single-column designs with large fonts. Do you see that as a permanent design shift?

**Damian:** I think there is a trend these days to gravitate towards bigger fonts and clean, one-column designs because it is much more enjoyable to read. People sometimes compare big fonts to children's novels, but the research is showing that most of us prefer that easy-to-read experience. The beginning days of the web were dominated by sites that tried to look as professional as possible, and some people believed that very small font sizes represented professionalism. It's almost as if they were trying to make their copy look like a legal textbook. 

**iwmn:** One thing I find very appealing about Silvrback is that it's fully hosted, which makes it simple to get in and go. On the flip side, we're seeing lots of new platforms come out with Dropbox hosting. What are your thoughts on that?

**Damian:** Endless tinkering with setups and preferences is something I wanted to spare Silvrback users from. I used to waste so much time in the past customizing Wordpress or Tumblr themes. I think people should spend that time on their writing instead. With regards to Dropbox, I'm considering giving users the option to pull markdown documents from their public Dropbox repo.

**iwmn:** Ok ok. One more question, and it's not about blogging. You seem to be a guy with good taste—what should I eat for dinner tonight? I'm starving.

**Damian:** I'm a big fan of garlic bread. Start with a whole loaf of Rosemary Ciabatta bread. Then coat the base with a 50/50 spread of butter/mayonnaise. (mayonnaise is key). Add chopped garlic, basil, and then top is off with three-cheese mexican cheese mix. Bake for 20 minutes and enjoy a little slice of heaven.
