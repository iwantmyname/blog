A little backstory here. I, as an active member of the internet, have probably started and killed close to a dozen Tumblr sites. But with new blog platforms coming into existence by the bushel, I haven't done anything on the platform since the [Yahoo! acquisition](http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an). 

So as an inquisitive soul, this happy jaunt into Tumblrland will probably be as new for me as it is for you. Enjoy!

Tumblr, Tumblr, Tumblr. If there's a blog platform on the internet anywhere near as confusing to explain as Tumblr, I'd be shocked.

On one hand, Tumblr is a pseudo-blog platform that's painfully easy to get started on. In ten minutes, even an internet novice can get up and running, but understanding what's going on is a completely different issue. It's because Tumblr is also a social platform where things get liked and reblogged by brilliant minds and hyper 14-year-olds alike. It's really somewhere between Blogger and Facebook, capturing a target audience that skews younger, but isn't unwelcoming for anyone. 

To put its popularity in perspective, here's a blurb from Eric Savitz on [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/24/why-2013-is-the-year-you-need-to-get-serious-about-tumblr/):

> Consumers in the critical 18-34 year old demographic are hooked on Tumblr, with the average visitor spending 1.5 hours per month on the site. Today, Tumblr hosts 90 million blogs that generate more than 89 million new posts every day. This astronomical growth helped the site soar into lists of the top 10 most popular websites in the U.S. at the end of last year and is attracting significant interest from brands ranging from fashion to finance.

###Setup.

As with any web platform in our [marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services), Tumblr is incredibly simple to link up with an iwantmyname domain name. If you haven't purchased a domain yet, just get one through [this page](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url). Since our domain (iwantmyblog.com) was already purchased and installed on Scriptogram ([from last week](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-pros-and-cons-of-individual-files-our-last-day-with-scriptogram-iwantmyblog.html)), our process was just slightly more complicated. Here's what I did: click Setup > Apps & Services > Tumblr > Add Tumblr > Remove Scriptogram > Install Tumblr. 

Now it gets a little weird. Go to [tumblr.com](http://tumblr.com) and click "sign up for a new account." From there, you'll get to your first taste of being social—a page that instructs you to follow five people. 

###Being social.

As I stated before, Tumblr is a social ecosystem and a blog platform all wrapped into one strange platform. 

From Time's aptly titled [*What Is Tumblr?*](http://techland.time.com/2013/05/19/what-is-tumblr/):

> If you want to write a several-thousand-word opus about something, Tumblr isn't the place to do it. If you want to share a [moving picture of a little kid acting like a detective](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2pjubEvYA1qzf1uxo1_250.gif) as quickly and easily as possible, Tumblr is a good place to do it. That's the microblogging aspect to Tumblr. Then, other Tumblr users who like moving pictures of little kids acting like detectives can follow you on Tumblr so they're sure to see every moving little-kid-acting-like-a-detective picture you post. That's the social networking aspect to Tumblr.

So follow five people (you can/should follow more later) and get to the dashboard (the page after the app callout—go ahead and download the app, too). As you'll see, it's just like any other blogging dashboard, but instead of just showing your posts, you'll see posts from all the people you follow. This is your portal to the world of Tumblr. An entire ecosystem of weird Tumblogs about anything from tech news to comic books to [rich kids taking selfies by their airplanes](http://richkidsofinstagram.tumblr.com/). 

Let it sink in.

And one last thing before we're done. Go to Settings then click on your Tumblr name (it'll be the last option in the navigation on the left) and type in your custom domain. Since you've already set it up on iwantmyname, it should test with no issues. 

Bravo, brave soul. You're now on Tumblr.
