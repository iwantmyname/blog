So here's the origin of the problem*. When Twitter launched not that long ago (can you believe it only started in 2006?), they chose to limit posts to 140 characters. For many, that 140 character limit created a perfect environment for short thoughts and conversations, but it was a nightmare for posting links. I mean, just look at a fairly short link like `https://iwantmyname.com/blog/`. That's at least a million characters (29).

Quickly, it became very important to keep these links short. Really short. And by 2009, Twitter started using bitly as their link shortener of choice (they've since started using t.co for all sites, which doesn't exactly have a custom ring to it).

For most users, a bitly link looks something like this: bit.ly/xxxxxxx. Basically, it turned any 25+ character link into something around 15. But why would a person or company choose to use bit.ly/xxxxxxx as opposed to something custom. Something branded. For these savvy entities that wanted a branded solution, bitly started offering [custom link shortening](http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/76740-what-s-a-custom-short-domain-and-why-do-i-want-on).

###How It Works. 

The process to setup your own shortened link is shockingly simple. First, get your domain at [iwantmyname.com](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/bit.ly-pro-custom-domain-short-url-forwarding-service) (if you already have an iwantmyname domain, just install bitly in the [marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services)). 

Then, [sign up](https://bitly.com/a/sign_up) for a bitly account, go into Settings, click Advanced, then plug in your custom domain. Just keep in mind that to properly use a short domain, you need to get a short domain to pair with the standard domain you're using. Here's an example. For our shortened link, we're using iwnt.my (a great example of a short [domain hack](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html)). Not only is it short—it retains all the branding we know and love. 

Now, when you're ready to post, you can either shorten your link at bitly.com, download the [Chrome extension](https://bitly.com/a/tools) or use any of the amazing [third-party tools](http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/228830-how-do-i-connect-my-bitly-account-to-other-social-) that work with the service (we use [Droplr](http://droplr.com) and [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/), but that's for another post). All work great, but some work better for different workflows.

So if you're interested in doing some link shortening for yourself or your brand, give [bitly](https://bitly.com/) a shot. We definitely recommend it.

*Technically, companies like TinyURL have been in the link shortening business since 2002, but it didn't really become "a thing" until Twitter came to be.
