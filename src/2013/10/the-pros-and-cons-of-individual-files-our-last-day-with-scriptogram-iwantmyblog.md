In many ways, the internet is a fragile beast. You can make all the backups you want, but unless you can access each of your files individually, it's hard to feel totally secure. Fortunately, using a Dropbox-based blog platform like Scriptogram, you can take all your posts with you, no matter where you want to go.

And now that we're leaving Scriptogram to try out our next blog platform, it's time to package everything up into one tiny package. In your Dropbox folder, go to Apps -> Scriptogram and then move all your content to a good place. That's it!

Here's where the challenge lies. Unlike leaving a platform like Wordpress which gives you a big file you can just import somewhere else, Dropbox blogging keeps all your posts separated. That means you have to import them one-by-one unless you're moving to another Dropbox platform (you also might have to strip out the Markdown formatting, depending on the platform)—a real drag if you're moving to something like Squarespace.

But look at the bright side. At least you know all your data is all there!
