Dear Internet Community,

<!-- /excerpt -->

### Freedom.

The internet is a big place, and as an online company, we're ok with people being located in faraway places. Our office is in beautiful Wellington, New Zealand, but if you're a geek with serious coding skills in New York, Berlin, Lagos, São Paulo or anywhere else on the planet, you're the perfect applicant. 

### Awesomeness.

Our current stack is flexible and fun, and we're using a ton of toys to make it better every day. Currently, we're using modern Perl, Erlang, Coffee Script, Lua, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Kyoto Tycoon, Puppet, Vagrant—and we're always looking for more.

And we love open source, so we'll be expecting you to contribute a lot to various projects and the community at-large.

### A Task.

If this sounds like the perfect job for you, fire up a console window and get in touch by doing the following dig lookup:
