<!-- excerpt -->

In the business world of today, few things scream "I don't get the internet!" more than sending company emails from non-branded email accounts. It's not that platforms like gmail and Hotmail aren't secure or stable enough for businesses, there's just a level of professionalism and polish associated with an address like chris@iwantmyname.com versus iwantmynamechris@gmail.com.

But if you've been using a gmail (or Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc.) account for your business for any length of time, transferring to something custom branded can be incredibly time consuming. You have to download your emails, back them up so they won't get lost, then re-sync them while praying nothing goes wrong. Depending on your platform, it could take hours, or even days to accomplish.

Instead, you could just use [YippieMove](http://www.yippiemove.com). With YippieMove, you can transfer all your emails from more than 100 preconfigured email providers without any slowdowns or data loss (your emails and attachments will be identical copies, not a gibberish mess). And because it's all completed through YippieMove servers, and any errors or snags you'd normally have to deal with are handled smoothly by their support team.

There's no hassle, no fuss, and it works with all the standard email hosting platforms currently available in our [Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/). So if you're moving to a custom email platform soon, I'd recommend giving YippieMove a shot.
