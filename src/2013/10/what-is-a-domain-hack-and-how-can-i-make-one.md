title: What Is A Domain Hack And How Can I Make One?
----

<!-- excerpt -->

At some point in the late 90s/early 2000s, hacking got a really bad rap, but to most of the development community, there's nothing malicious about it. Hacking just means using using a bunch of readily available tools to make something cool—like modifying code to make things faster or using pre-existing platforms to build new website functions. In a way, modern hacking is just the newer, nerdier version of tuning cars to get more horsepower or training dogs to get drinks out of the fridge.

Ok, that last one was a stretch.

But of all the hacks possible on the web, nothing is as accessible (or immediately gratifying) as a domain hack.

**Domain hack** - Using domain extensions like .es and .io to create words or phrases out of domain names.
***

At the moment, the vast majority of sites on the web use .com as their domain extension. apple.com. microsoft.com. nike.com. And for most brands, it makes a lot of sense—if you're looking to buy yourself a new Honda, the assumption is that their website will be honda.com. But for brands and blogs that exist solely on the internet and are primarily accessed via social link or bookmark, we're slowly seeing sites move away from the norm.

**Example 1:** When someone asks me about bitly link shortening, I know their URL because of their original domain name—bit.ly. That's a domain hack using the .ly domain extension. 

**Example 2:** One of the first site discovery apps that gained mass popularity was Delicious, and they started with a huge domain hack--del.icio.us, using the .us domain extension. 

**Example 3:** We're now even seeing many companies with .com names dabbling in domain hacking. Try goo.gl for a Google link shortener, n.pr to get to the popular US radio station, NPR, or iwantmy.name for a cool way to get to our site.

The fact is that while .com names are easily the most popular today, we're simply running out of good options available. If you're looking for something short and catchy, you're practically forced to look outside of the .com realm. And in 10 years, who knows what will be left.

### Something To Get Your Mind Going.

If you're looking to get a great domain hack for yourself, here are a few good domain extensions to start with.

(Note: Many of the examples are probably already taken. These are just thought starters.)

**.es**: mak.es, bak.es, flak.es, cak.es, tak.es, cod.es, dat.es, pag.es, pi.es, stor.es, smor.es (yum), veggi.es, whistl.es, [YOURNAME]lik.es

**.is**: chris.is/moving, mike.is/blogging, soccer.is/awesome, domainhacking.is/exciting

**.io**: rad.io, pat.io, tr.io, rat.io, aud.io, cheer.io, portfol.io, scenar.io, card.io

**.ch**: ea.ch, ou.ch, mu.ch, hun.ch, bun.ch, lun.ch, bot.ch, por.ch, rea.ch, psy.ch, quen.ch, stit.ch, retou.ch, overmat.ch, workben.ch, laun.ch, ostri.ch

**.se**: adverti.se, wheelhou.se, hor.se, despi.se, disea.se, presi.se, verbo.se, brui.se, grea.se, impo.se, mous.se, prai.se, revi.se, cau.se, cha.se

And there are countless more—you just have to be creative (also, don't forget to use the [Scrabble Word Finder](http://www.scrabblefinder.com/) and [domai.nr](https://domai.nr/)—both are lifesavers). So get out there and have some fun with your domain name. The world of domain hacking awaits!
