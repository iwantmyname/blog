As of today we're adding two new country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) to our [list of international extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions):

*   [.HT - the Haitian domain and](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ht-haitian-domain-name-registration-for-haiti)
*   [.COM.SB - the web address of Solomon Islands](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.sb-domain-name-registration-for-solomon-islands)
Both .HT and .COM.SB domains can also be [transferred to iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer).

We are also working on the implementation of the **new .TEL domain extension** which will be available on our site **from March 24th 2009**. For more information about .TEL please [visit the official registry Telnic](http://telnic.org/).
