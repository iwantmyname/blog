Now you can not only [publish status updates for Twitter or Facebook in a cool way](http://mashable.com/2009/08/10/flipmytext/) but also register very unique domain names. So why not astonish your friends with an upside down domain of your first name? Our [fun domain name generator FlipMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/domain-tools/name-generator/turn-words-upside-down "Domain Name Generator Tool FlipMyName") makes this possible. Just enter your name and you'll be presented with a flipped version.

### Available first names under .COM

*   Tim - ʇıɯ.com
*   James - ɾɐɯǝs.com
*   Mark - ʞɹɐɯ.com
*   John - uɥoɾ.com

It's fun for sharing links on Twitter, Facebook or in your email and forum footer. You could also [create your own URL shortener](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/08/10-tools-to-run-an-url-shortener-on-your-own-custom-domain.html "create your own URL shortener") with it. The technology behind this is around for years by the way. Domains are registered as [IDNs](https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names "Register IDNs - Internationalised Domain Names") (Internationalised Domain Names) and are accessible by any modern browser.
