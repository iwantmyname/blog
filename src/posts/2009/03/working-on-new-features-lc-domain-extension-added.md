Over the last couple of weeks we were primarily working under the hood of iWantMyName with necessary back end changes for the [new version of our iPhone DomainApp](https://iwantmyname.com/iphone), preparing the site for new [features](https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns) and migrating our DNS infrastructure to a more flexible solution.

Furthermore we welcome a new domain extension at iWantMyName: .LC, the [country code top-level domain of Saint Lucia](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lc-domain-name-registration-for-saint-lucia), an island nation in the Caribbean Sea. More domain extensions will follow in the coming weeks, starting with the new .TEL domain which will be available for general registration from Mar 24th.

Don't forget to [follow iWantMyName on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwmn) to be notified of new features and other announcements.
