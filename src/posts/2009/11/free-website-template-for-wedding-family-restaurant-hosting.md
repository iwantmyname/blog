With the [demise of Geocities](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/08/website-hosting-alternatives-to-your-geocities-page.html), it was only a matter of time before Google ramped up its website creation offering for the mass consumer market. [Google Sites](http://sites.google.com) has been around for a while but this week they launched a [new template gallery](http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2009/11/get-started-with-google-sites-templates.html) which further simplifies making your own personal or small business website.

The free website builder is aimed firmly at small companies, home users, schools and not-for-profits who just need to get online with a basic brochure quality set-up and who don't have corporate level online marketing budgets to spend. The new templates  should drive a lot of interest in the service, which previously had only a low profile.

Customers managing their domains through iWantMyName get free provisioning so that they can hang all their Google docs, including GMail and Sites beneath their own personal domain name. So now you don't need a team of web experts to set up all the services you need for a home office, small or medium sized enterprise or not-for-profit organisation.
