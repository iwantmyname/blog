After the recent addition of [.MX (Mexico) domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico ".MX Domain Extension - Mexico"), we are introducing another country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for you at iWantMyName.

The Dutch [.NL domain extension](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands ".NL Domain Extension - Netherlands") can now be registered at only $19.00 USD / year. With 3.5 million total registrations, the web address of the Netherlands is one of the top 10 domain extensions worldwide and the second biggest country code domain in Europe after [Germany's .DE suffix](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany ".DE German Domain Extension"). More information can be found at the official [.NL registry](http://sidn.nl/ ".NL Domain Registry") website.

Of course, the .NL domain search and registration is also available through our [iPhone DomainApp](https://iwantmyname.com/iphone).
