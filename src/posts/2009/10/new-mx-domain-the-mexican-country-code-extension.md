----

As of today you can register [.MX domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico) (Mexico) at iWantMyName. The domain registration requirements are similar to [.COM domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial) so there are no restrictions or local requirements. Our introduction price is $99.00 USD for all new registrations.

The Mexican country code domain extension was only opened for registration earlier this year. Before that Mexico's web address could only be registered under the second-level [.COM.MX domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.mx-mexican-domain-name-registration-for-mexico) (.NET.MX, .ORG.MX and others are restricted).

More information about .MX and Mexico:

*   Population: 111 million
*   Language: Spanish
*   Total domains: approx. 300k
*   Official registry: nic.mx
