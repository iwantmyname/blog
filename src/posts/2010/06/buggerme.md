We've been having some fun today playing with the search settings at [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/). 

It's interesting how language changes over the years and Kiwi English is no exception. Words that might have been unacceptable or uncommon twenty years ago sometimes end up becoming the norm. A certain fruity term received a boost a few years ago with a [controversial TV ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R1JOcl0VlA) aimed at selling Toyota trucks to farmers. In fact the moral outrage that ensued probably caused the phrase to be cemented as part of our Kiwi lexicon, rather than discouraging its use.

It can be very frustrating when you dream up a brilliant new web address
 only to discover that someone already secured it. We empathise with your
 disappointment so we changed our search response to reflect 
accordingly. For example if you [search for 
"All Whites" related domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/search?domain=allwhites) - see what happens. And speaking of All Whites, keep an eye on our [twitter channel](https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz) for some special deals during the Football World Cup.
