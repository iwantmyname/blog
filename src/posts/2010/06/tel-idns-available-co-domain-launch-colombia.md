The top-level domain (TLD) of Colombia is [opening up to anyone worldwide](http://www.cointernet.co/domain/launch/general-availability) on July 20, 2010. While the registry [.CO Internet](http://cointernet.co) is marketing the TLD as a domain extension for general use, you should be aware that it is in fact a country code suffix.

More information on pricing at iWantMyName will be available shortly.
