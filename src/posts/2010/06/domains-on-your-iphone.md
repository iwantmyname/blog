How many times have you been out somewhere or chatting to friends when a great idea for a domain name popped into your head? With the [iWantMyName DomainApp](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone) you can search for and register domains from your iPhone anywhere, anytime. It's a great free tool that has had thousands of downloads and some great reviews since we first launched iWantMyName globally. DomainApp even got a [nice mention on Mashable](http://mashable.com/2009/03/26/iphone-job-search-apps/) last year as a 'must have'.

With millions of Apple iPhone 4 flying out the door now, the market for mobile search and registration can only grow. Incidently [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) looks great on the iPad too. We've designed the DomainApp so that it interacts with the iWantMyName platform in a swift and seamless fashion and offer customers a much nicer way to handle domain registration. So next time you are hatching a plan for your next big web project over a couple of beers, there is no excuse for not securing the domain you need.
