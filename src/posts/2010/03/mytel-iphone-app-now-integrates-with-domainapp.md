Telnic recently launched an improved version of [My.tel](http://telnic.org/tools-iphone-mytel.html), a free iPhone application for managing your .TEL domain names from your mobile phone and which integrates directly with the [iWantMyName DomainApp](https://iwantmyname.com/iphone). Simply update your .TEL domain before boarding a plane, on a road trip, or whenever you need to tell people how they can reach you. You can even publish your location with an embedded map.

**New features of My.tel 2.0 include:**

*   Complete domain management capabilities: anything you can do in your .TEL hosting panel is now possible with the iPhone application
*   Improved usability: new navigation and editing interfaces
*   Multi-domain capable: Manage multiple domains at once

Look for the built-in "buy a .tel" link to purchase new domains directly from your iPhone. Both the [My.tel](http://telnic.org/tools-iphone-mytel.html) and our [DomainApp](https://iwantmyname.com/iphone) can be downloaded for free on the iTunes App Store.

Many thanks to the Telnic team for integrating DomainApp and placing their trust in iWantMyName!
