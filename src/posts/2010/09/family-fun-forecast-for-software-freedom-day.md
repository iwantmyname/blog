We are hugely pleased to be able to support [Software Freedom Day](http://www.softwarefreedomday.org.nz/) again this year. SFD aims to educate the public about the 
benefits of using high quality free and open source software in education, government, at 
home, and in business. As a business ourselves whose technical team are heavily involved in the open source developer community, we thought it highly appropriate to get involved. It's great to see this event going from strength to strength.

We will be turning out at the [Wellington Software Freedom Day event](http://archived.link/http://www.softwarefreedomday.org.nz/Wellington) on Sunday 19th September. The event is being held at [Victoria University's city campus ](http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Victoria+University+Pipitea+Campus&sll=-41.288255,174.777482&sspn=0.00732,0.021136&gl=nz&ie=UTF8&hq=Victoria+University+Pipitea+Campus&hnear=&ll=-41.274678,174.778233&spn=0.013837,0.042272&z=15&iwloc=A)next to the Wellington Railway Station. Look out for the iWantMyName banner and a big bowl of choccies. For fun we will also bring our QR code printer along. If you have a favourite web address, we are very happy to print off a free QR code sticker for you. Smartphone users snap the QR code image and go directly to your site. Incidentally, we provide [QR codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) to all our customers through their individual domain management dashboard. It's all part of the friendly service.

Software Freedom events around New Zealand are very much a family affair and there will be loads of fun activities, games and giveaways for kids. Come along and catch up with the iWantMyName crew or follow our [live tweets](https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ) on the day. We'd love to get your feedback on our [iPhone Domain App](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone) and our [domain registrar site](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/).
