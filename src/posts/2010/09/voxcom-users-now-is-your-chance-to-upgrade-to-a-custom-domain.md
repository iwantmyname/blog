Last week Six Apart announced the [shutdown of their free Vox.com blog service](http://archived.link/http://closing.vox.com/). One shortcoming of the system was the inability to use a custom domain name for a blog which means that users have no other choice than changing their web address should they decide to move to another service such as Six Apart's own [TypePad](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/typepad-professional-blog-service-dns-setup), newcomer [Posterous](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/posterous-blog-photos-mp3-video-by-email) or [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com).

This shows again the importance of [having control over your web address](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html) with a custom domain name. Similar to phone numbers, domains can be transferred between providers (registrars) and more importantly you can point them to any [service of your liking](https://iwantmyname.com/services).

So if you are a Vox.com user, before [migrating your blog to another service](http://archived.link/http://closing.vox.com/en/move-to-posterous-or-wordpress.html) you should think of [buying your own domain name first](https://iwantmyname.com).
