Over the last few weeks we experienced some issues with our DNS manager. The result was that a small number of our customers could not update DNS records properly. For this we sincerely apologise. First our back end played up, later it was a problem with the user interface after we changed our website form framework. We should stress that the continuity of the DNS service was maintained at all times. The majority of customers will not have experienced any problem at all.

Changing our website forms also resulted in some of your support inquiries not reaching us. So if you did not receive an email response to a support request within 24 hours, please re-submit your message. Again, we are sorry for this problem and the delay in getting back to you!

We take our responsibilities to you very seriously, 
so we have made some changes to set things straight. We've now 
released a new iteration of our DNS manager and also switched to a more 
scalable back end. As a result, all domain registrations will use the 
following nameservers hostnames from now on:

ns1.iwantmyname.net

ns2.iwantmyname.net

ns3.iwantmyname.net

ns4.iwantmyname.net

Existing
 domain names will be migrated to the new DNS infrastructure 
over the next few days without any service interruption.

Thank you very much for your support and patience whilst we 
experienced 
these growing pains. Responding to feedback from our customers is how we
 improve, so please feel free to yell at us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ), drop us an
[ email](mailto:help@support.iwantmyname.com) or leave [feedback](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) if you encounter any problems in 
the future.
