The saga around China domain names continues with this week's rumour that every .CN website owner may have to [apply in person for a web address](http://www.stephanevangelder.com/archives/308-Chinese-authorities-want-to-meet-every-new-.CN-website-owner-in-person!.html). Luckily there is another unrestricted alternative, in addition to [.CN.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china), suitable for the Chinese market: the generic .ASIA top-level domain.

### 5 reasons why you should consider .ASIA for your website###

*   .ASIA is governed by international authorities outside of China. It provides security, stability and is used and commonly known for the Asian region.
*   A .ASIA domain can be registered by anybody, quickly and easily without the hassle of documentation.
*   Asia is the market of tomorrow. Did you know, that .ASIA domains can improve the search engine ranking for queries relevant to the Asian market? The term "asia" itself is already one of the most popular search keywords.
*   The .ASIA namespace is still young so the chances of getting your desired domain name beneath .ASIA are more likely than in the .COM or .NET extension.
*   .ASIA registrations help fund community work in the Asian region such as [Relief.asia](http://relief.asia), [ISIF.asia](http://isif.asia) (R&D Grants Fund), [CreativeCommons.asia](http://archived.link/http://creativecommons.asia), [OLPC.asia](http://olpc.asia) (One-Laptop-Per-Child initiative in Asia).

In addition to our special offer for .CN.COM domains, we will also run a [promotion for the .ASIA extension](https://iwantmyname.com/domain-promos). All new registrations will only be $14.90 USD from March 1st, 2010. Go and [get your .ASIA domain now](https://iwantmyname.com)!
