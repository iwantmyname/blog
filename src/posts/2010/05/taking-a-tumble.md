Did you know that [we're on Tumblr now](http://tumblr.iwantmyname.com/)? The free [blog hosting](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting "Blog software") service at [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/ "Tumblr") allows you to quickly post things that you discover from around the web. Follow us for quick bits about the domain name world, web apps and stuff we like. Recent updates include a domain name fail, TLDs of the Worldcup 2010, and our friends from Couch.io going crazy in their [CouchDB](http://couchdb.org/ "CouchDB") rap.

Maybe you'd like to set up your own Tumblr page? Remember [iWantMyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) customers can personalise Tumblr pages with their own chosen domain using our free [custom domain setup service](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url). We can even recommend [some cool background themes](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/04/3-awesome-simple-tumblr-themes-designed-by-jarred-bishop.html) for your site. If you need other apps or services to manage social media content for your business or personal use we make it [easy to set up](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) these as well.
