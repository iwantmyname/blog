At [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) we want to make it a lot easier to hook up your favourite web apps to your chosen domain. Our web app directory already contains [more than 30 services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory) including the following categories: [email](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting), [blogs](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting), [website builder](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder), [forums](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/forum-hosting), [ecommerce](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting), [portfolios](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting), [social networks](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/social-network), [url shortener](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/url-shortener) and [wikis](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/wiki-hosting). There is a handy [overview page](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns#web-app-directory) that lists all the available apps and services. In addition to the web apps we've also provided additional documentation and information within the user dashboard to assist with more specific custom domain mapping of your favourite service. [Log in](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/signin) and check it out.

With these major upgrades to the dashboard we've made it a whole lot easier, not only for website administrators, developers or sys admins who require greater control over domain set-up, but also for users with a non-technical background. These changes are intended to dramatically improve the ability of our customers to manage their domain names and personalise services.

The DNS management tool has been completely re-written and is available from the dashboard when logged in. It offers an easy-peasy way to handle domain set-ups in more detail. Let us know if you have any troubles using it - we always love to get feedback so we can further improve the iWantMyName platform. There are some big future plans for DNS management on the site, which will be especially interesting for developers. We will let you know, so stay tuned!
