title: Bring Your International Domain Names Back Home



----

Now that [
iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) has returned home to New Zealand from its Big O.E., we giving you the 
opportunity to do the same with all your international domain names. So if 
you currently have your .COMs with a big foreign company but would like to bring them back home - here's a [special 
transfer offer](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) for you:

**.COM / .NET / .ORG / .BIZ / .INFO / 
.NAME: $14.90 NZD**

We can transfer many more international domain 
extensions. Have a look at our [transfer page](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) for all supported 
extensions. (Of course if you have domains with a local provider, the same great transfer deal still applies)

Remember we offer a whole bunch of [nifty free services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) that you don't get with those other guys such as easy domain customisation of all your favourite web apps.

Follow [@iWantMyNameNZ](https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz) and [@DomainpromosNZ](https://twitter.com/domainpromosnz) for 
Twitter-only domain promos.
