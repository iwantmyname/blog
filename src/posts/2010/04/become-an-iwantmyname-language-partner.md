title: Become An iWantMyName Language Partner



----

Much of our time in 2009 was spent on refining our domain management service to make it more attractive to partners around the globe. Consequently we launched a Dutch language partner site called [Benikvrij](http://benikvrij.nl) and a German site called [meinName](http://meinname.com). We also designed a system that means we can roll out a new implementation of the iWantMyName platform within a few days and scale up rapidly as customer demand grows. We provide our partner companies with a complete set of front end templates and they make the necessary translation into their home language. Of course we handle the billing set-up including whatever currency is required and make it compatible with any existing systems. You are also free in the choice of any domain registrar back end on the market.

With ICANN moving steadily towards full implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), it is encouraging to know that we have already invested in a fully IDN capable system. The Russian and Arabic language domain name space looks set to heat up for this reason very soon. But we also see great opportunities in parts of Asia such as Japan and Korea where high average incomes and heavy internet usage combine to present an attractive proposition for a niche registrar player. South America looks like an interesting story as well. With an increasingly affluent middle class population and a highly developed mobile internet infrastructure, we'd love to see a Spanish or Portuguese language version of iWantMyName in that market.

We think that users all around the world will continue to demand a better experience when it comes to domain registration and management and we believe that iWantMyName provides a unique, easy-to-use package that helps domain registrars and resellers to grow market share. In particular our innovative [web app domain customization service](https://iwantmyname.com/services) gives registrars a competitive advantage. Therefore we are now inviting expressions of interest from companies interested in deploying a customized version of iWantMyName in a foreign language market to meet the needs of their customers.
