title: .CO Launches



----

You can now register
[ .CO domains (Colombia)](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) at iWantMyName. The .CO extension is not only 
the official Colombian country code top-level domain (ccTLD) but also a 
shorter alternative to [.COM](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial) or other ccTLDs such as [.CO.UK](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) (United 
Kingdom) or [.CO.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) (New Zealand). New domain name registrations are 
available at an affordable price of $49.00

So what can .CO 
stand for? Here are some examples:

* Company
* Corporation
* Community
* Cooperation


You 
could also follow Twitter's example which registered the t.co domain 
name for their own [URL shortener](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/url-shortener) or have a look at the following lists 
with domains that are still available after the initial Sunrise and 
Landrush registration phase:

* [265 .CO Domains That Weren't Registered During the Landrush](http://domainnamewire.com/2010/07/18/265-co-domains-that-werent-registered-in-landrush/)
* [233 U.S. Cities Over 100,000
 Population Available to Register As .CO Domains](http://domainnamewire.com/2010/07/18/265-co-domains-that-werent-registered-in-landrush/)

Maybe there's 
one or the other neat domain hack that's interesting for you too: [words 
ending with 'co'](http://www.morewords.com/ends-with/co/)

As you can see, many opportunities are still out
 there, so don't wait too long (the best ones are going fast) and [
register your own .CO domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia)
