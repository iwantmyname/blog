title: Register .NZ Domain Names With Māori Macron Characters



----

As [Māori Language Week](http://www.korero.maori.nz/news/mlw) begins it is now possible to register .[NZ domain names](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) with Macrons. The technology behind these new addresses are so-called Internationalised Domain Names ([IDNs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name "Internationalized domain name")) which translate the special characters into a computer readable format.

Internationalised Domain Names are available for all second-level .NZ domains available at iWantMyName: [.CO.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand), [.NET.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand), [.ORG.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand), [.MAORI.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/maori.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand), [.GEEK.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/geek.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) and [.SCHOOL.NZ](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/school.nz-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand). The new system makes it also possible to access domains under MĀORI.NZ so you can even enter a web address such as tēnākoe.māori.nz (note the ā in the second-level domain).

We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the process. This is a significant step for Māori on the internet which began with the introduction of the .MAORI.NZ domain a few years ago. [Karaitiana Taiuru](http://www.taiuru.maori.nz), a leading advocate for the multi-lingual internat says that, other [milestones for the Māori language](http://archived.link/http://blog.taiuru.maori.nz/2010/07/decade-of-advocating-for-maori.html) over the last 10 years have been the availability of Google, Microsoft Windows and many Open Source projects in Māori.

.NZ IDNs can be registered at the [recently reduced](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/07/mid-winter-specials-already-winner.html) price of $25.90 NZD. Go and [buy your Māori domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz) now.
