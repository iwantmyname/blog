[.GL Domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland) (Greenland) are the latest addition to the ever growing [list of TLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) (Top-Level Domains) available for registration at iWantMyName.

There are no restrictions or special requirements so anyone worldwide is allowed to register the .GL country domain. Internationally, the domain name goo.gl is probably the most famous .GL web address. Google is using it as [URL shortener](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener) for some of their services.

The internet extension of Greenland can be registered at $89.00 USD. [Buy your .GL domain now](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/gl-greenlandic-domain-name-registration-for-greenland).
