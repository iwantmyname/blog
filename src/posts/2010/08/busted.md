Our strategy of using [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwantmynamenz) as a secondary support channel paid off at the weekend when our [online support page](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) threw a wobbly and crashed in a steaming heap of crud. Fortunately we received some tweet alerts from friends and were able to get cracking and sort out the problem. 

At [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) we pride ourselves on providing a rapid response to service enquiries because it is one of the ways we can differentiate ourselves in the domain registrar marketplace. So we really appreciated that people were able to let us know about the problem.

We are pleased to report that the [support page](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) is working again. During normal working hours we generally respond within two hours. At weekends or overnight you should receive a response within 24 hours. However if you posted a request over the weekend and feel that it has not yet been addressed, please do [let us know](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support). Thanks for your patience.
