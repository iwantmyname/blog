Earlier this year the Chinese government instituted some law changes that led to .CN domain registrations by overseas registrars being blocked. For a period of time foreign individuals were effectively prevented from registering a domain name within China. For the time being this restriction has been lifted but extensive documentation is still required from foreign businesses before .CN domains are released. Unfortunately, as a result of these issues, we decided to remove the .CN domain extension from iWantMyName. However, China is a rapidly growing market and many New Zealand businesses now have extensive interests there. These companies should be considering how best to protect their identity online. 

Here are some other options available if you wish to secure a safe and recognisable domain identity in China or North Asia generally. We recommend registering a [.COM](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial) / [.NET](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network) Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) or making use of the new [.ORG IDNs](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names) with Chinese characters instead. [PIR](http://pir.org/), the registry for .ORG, [](http://pir.org/)is now allowing IDNs with both the [Chinese](http://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables/tables/cn_zh-cn_4.0.html) and [Traditional Chinese](http://www.iana.org/domains/idn-tables/tables/tw_zh-tw_4.0.html) character sets. Another alternative is [.CN.COM](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china), a great domain for doing business in China. We are currently offering a [massive discount](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/cn.com-chinese-domain-name-registration-for-china) to drive interest in this domain.

We also strongly support .ASIA . This is a relatively new domain, so there are still many good names available. It is also very reasonably priced. Using a [.ASIA domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/asia-domain-name-registration-for-asia) assists greatly with search engine ranking within the Asia region as well. All of the registries mentioned above operate outside of Mainland China and are not subject to the same constraints as .CN domains.

Chinese character .ORG domains and most other Chinese character domains can be discovered and registered through our standard [domain search](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) which is already fully IDN enabled.

Here is [an example of a search](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/search?domain=%E7%89%9B+%E5%90%89) for a Chinese character domain.
