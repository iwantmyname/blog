As of February 1, 2010, it will be possible to register the Luxembourgish .LU domain name extension without a local address in Luxembourg. This means that anyone worldwide can [register .LU domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lu-luxembourgian-domain-name-registration-for-luxembourg) for personal or business use.

This new rule allows us to reduce the price for our valued customers. All new domain registrations and renewals will be reduced from $59.00 to $49.00 USD.

The .LU registry also announced the introduction of [Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)](https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names) starting in April. More details on this coming soon.
