What better way to begin the new year 2010 than by receiving notice about price reductions from several registries? And since we always strive to pass on better prices to our customers, we are happy to announce the following new prices for the Russian, Polish and Czech domain extensions:

*   [.CZ Domain Names](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cz-domain-name-registration-for-czech-republic): $59.00 --&gt; $39.00 USD
*   [.RU Domain Names](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ru-russian-domain-name-registration-for-russian-federation): $49.00 --&gt; $39.00 USD
*   [.PL Domain Names](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/pl-polish-domain-name-registration-for-poland): $79.00 --&gt; $39.00 USD

The Eastern European country code top-level domains are growing fast and can be found amongst the top 25 [most popular domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/10/country-code-top-level-domain-cctld-ranking-numbers-statistics.html) worldwide with .CZ (Czech Republic) having 591,000, .PL (Poland) 1.53 million and .RU (Russia) 2.31 million registered addresses in total. At iWantMyName we are fully enabled to search and register [Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)](https://iwantmyname.com/idns/search-register-internationalised-domain-names) which are now possible for both Cyrillic characters under .RU and the Polish alphabet letters within the .PL namespace.
