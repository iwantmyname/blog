[From Mike Carson:](http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/)

> Exactly one year ago today I created a list of the top .io domains. At that time there were only 676 .io domains in the top 1 million sites in the world (from Alexa). In one year that number has more than doubled to 1457.

Here's a little sample (the top 10):

> 
+ github.io - rank 307
+ codepen.io - rank 1372
+ soup.io - rank 3161
+ intercom.io - rank 3375
+ t411.io - rank 3477
+ meduza.io - rank 3546
+ keywordtool.io - rank 3637
+ popcorntime.io - rank 4816
+ spring.io - rank 5566
+ greenhouse.io - rank 6263

Short lists are interesting. Massive lists are amazing.
