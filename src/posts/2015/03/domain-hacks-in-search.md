In the world of domains, naming is a bit like an architecture project. The domain name has to stand on its own, make sense to those who use it, and be conventional enough to attract all types of potential guests. A standard domain name is much like a standard building—the outside can be nice, but it's really what's inside that counts.

But [domain hacks](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html) are a bit different. They're the circular buildings with no conventional walls, the tiny houses that don't make sense to most, the underground mud huts that only the adventurous flock to. A domain hack will likely never be the primary domain of a multinational corporation, but for those who appreciate cultural oddities, there's simply nothing better. 

So here's the deal. In our domain search, when you type in a word or brand, a single domain hack will now appear as the second result (if one is able to be made). It's nothing Earth-shattering—just a little something for your Thursday afternoon/Friday morning (depending on what side of the international date line you're on) pleasure.
