Money is a hard thing for a lot of people to talk about, so let's shift the focus a bit by putting a "." in front. 

+ money = aghhhhhhh
+ .money = awesome!

So what should the people of the internet do with their new .money (domains... [.money](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-money) goes live tomorrow)? Let me count the ways.

<!-- /excerpt -->

### 1. Start the world's most trusted Bitcoin blog 

As a brilliant financier who rode Bitcoins from around $200 to nearly $1,000, then back down to $200, I can safely say that I don't know right from left when it comes to Bitcoin valuations. But you know who else doesn't know anything about Bitcoin valuations? The rest of the internet. And if I know anything, it's that general confusion means there's a gap in the market, just waiting to be filled. And really, using .money for a digital publication about digital money is magic in the making.

### 2. Forget Bitcoins... start your own digital currency

This is beyond my scope, but there have to be a few iwantmynamers out there with cryptocurrency running through their veins. Seriously, if someone can build a currency around the doge meme, I think we (as in you and your friends) can band together to make something better. Just don't forget the .money.

### 3. Start a finance blog

Yes, if your finance blog gets big, you might have to buy (and sometimes wear) a suit or two, but that's the price you have to pay when you're a big time analyst.

### 4. Become a "startup finance expert"

Speaking of analysts, I feel like startup financing is having a bit of a PR issue these days. I read all the time about the overabundance of money flowing through places like Silicon Valley, but I rarely read about analysts saying the opposite. Going back to my gap-that-needs-to-be-filled theory, I think there's a big opportunity for someone to start an expert site telling the world that tech startups need more cash. 

Or maybe your site could be about bootstrapped companies like iwantmyname... your call.

### 5. Make your financial institution more "me" focused

Hear me out. Take your average bank, I'll go with Wells Fargo for this example.  The website for Wells Fargo is wellsfargo.com—.com meaning commercial. What this says to me is that Wells Fargo is a commercial entity that wants to make money. But I don't put money in the bank for them to make money, I do it so *I* can make money. So why not swap the bank's .com with .money and give people a little something to aspire to? wellsfargo.money sounds like a bank I could get on board with. 

### 6. Give your personal brand a makeover

Looking for a little personal brand boost? Change your personal website to `YOURNAME.money`. You're welcome.

### 7. Coupon site?

If the internet is in desperate need of something, it's definitely more coupon sites. Retail coupon sites, online services coupon sites, coupon sites for coupon sites—the possibilities are endless!
