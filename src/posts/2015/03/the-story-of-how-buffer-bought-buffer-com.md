[From Rodolphe Dutel - Buffer:](https://open.bufferapp.com/acquired-buffer-com/)

> There was a great blogpost that Joel wrote on how to name your startup, where he mentioned that the domain name of your startup doesn’t matter. In fact, thinking about Buffer’s own domain history, we originally started out with bfffr.com, when Joel launched Buffer in late 2010.
> 
> Joel went on to change it to bufferapp.com, to make things more clear and worry less about not having the exact domain of your startup’s name, “Buffer” in our case. It can be a huge time-suck in the early days of your company, where your first and foremost goal should be to hit product-market fit and building something people want.

> Spending time on acquiring a certain domain name could be a very futile exercise without a product that works. In fact, as Joel illustrates, most well-known companies all had “placeholder” domains for a long time before they got their actual name as their domain too:
> 
+ Square was squareup.com
+ DropBox was getdropbox.com
+ Facebook was thefacebook.com
+ Instagram was instagr.am
+ Twitter was twttr.com
+ Foursquare was playfoursquare.com

The primary point of the post is to tell the story of how Buffer acquired buffer.com, but the real story to me is that while most of us aren't "generat(ing) over $5m/year," and probably don't have the time or money to pay what it would cost to get a short .com in 2015, there's no reason you can't get to that level of success with a domain name you find less than perfect. Buffer had a $60m valuation while using bufferapp.com, and the roster of huge brands listed in the post that started with dodgy domains is pretty incredible. 

If you take anything away from this, it's that the domain name you choose is only a minor piece of a very large puzzle. Before you go throwing resources at the domain aftermarket, just grab a name that fits and make your product as solid as it can possibly be. Good work attracts customers—your domain is just a sticker on the door.
