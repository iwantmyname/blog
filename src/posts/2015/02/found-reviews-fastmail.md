[From Sebastian Lemery:](http://lemery.io/review-fastmail)

>I pay $40 a year for FastMail. That's $3.33 a month for something I use every day, multiple times an hour. Because I pay for this product, I get:
> 
+ Customer service oriented towards my happiness
+ No ads
+ A company focused on me, the customer, instead of advertisers
+ Features targeting users, not advertisers
> 
> I cannot stress this enough: pay for what you use. I love that I pay Fastmail to handle my email. I enjoy knowing their engineers are making money, improving the app I thoroughly enjoy using. When you don't pay for software, you create a void that must be filled by either selling your data or catering a product to advertisers. Even if you are indifferent, it still creates an environment where engineers are potentially assigned to features that appease advertisers over users.
