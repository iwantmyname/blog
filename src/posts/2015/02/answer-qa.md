title: Question. What extension should I use? Answer. .QA
excerpt: no
---

With all the new [generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) coming out, sometimes we forget to celebrate the other domains we add to the site. Just last week, we added a wonderful new country code top-level domain (ccTLD), .QA, to the list. 

.QA is the domain extension for Qatar, located on the Arabian Peninsula between Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Businesses and individuals in Qatar will certainly use the extension to establish a local presence, but for non-Qataris, .QA is the perfect acronym—**Q**uality **A**ssurance and **Q**uestions and **A**nswers—for a host of professional websites.
