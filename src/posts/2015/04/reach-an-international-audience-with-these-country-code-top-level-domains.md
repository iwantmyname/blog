<!-- excerpt -->

If you’re in the process of starting a new website and want to go with a shorter country domain extension rather than any of the [new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (or .COM), there's one thing you should know:

> Google treats some ccTLDs (such as .tv, .me, etc.) as gTLDs, as we’ve found that users and webmasters frequently see these more generic than country-targeted.

This means you can [set a geographic target through Google Webmaster Tools](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1347922?hl=en), e.g. use a .co domain and be listed in search results in the United States, Canada or France although it is actually Colombia’s top-level domain. The same is true if you don’t want to target a specific country, i.e. have a .me domain for your personal online profile.

But which ones of these so-called gccTLDs (generic country code top-level domains) are the most popular and more likely to be recognized by visitors?

<!-- /excerpt -->

Let’s take a look at Verisign’s [latest domain industry brief](http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/domain-name-report-march2015.pdf):

![verisign graph]({{ site.images_url }}/2015-04-21-gcctld-chart.png)

> Some ccTLDs, including .tk, .co, .me and .tv are frequently used by registrants and treated by search engines as gTLDs. This chart ranks the zone size of both gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs, as of Dec. 31, 2014, with that classification taken into account. The top 10 largest gTLDs and ccTLDs marketed as gTLDs by zone size were .com, .tk, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .co, .mobi, .me and .tv, as of Dec. 31, 2014, which account for 180.6 million domain name registrations, or 62.8 percent of the total global domain name registrations.

So we have [.tk](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau), [.co](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia), [.me](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro), and [.tv](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu) as the most popular gccTLDs in that list. Not surprising, except .tk which offers free domains—but with certain usage restrictions.

Other popular ones you may have seen are [.io](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) for tech sites (which is [still on the rise](http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/)), [.fm](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia) for music websites, [.cc](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cc-domain-name-registration-for-cocos-keeling-islands), and [.ws](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ws-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-western-samoa) for general use, as well as [.nu](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nu-domain-name-registration-for-niue) (popular in Scandinavian countries).

Lesser known gccTLDs, but often registered for [domain hacks](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/what-is-a-domain-hack-and-how-can-i-make-one.html) because they don’t require any special documentation or local address in the country, are the [.la](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/la-lao-domain-name-registration-for-laos), [.ms](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat), [.sc](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ms-domain-name-registration-for-montserrat), [.as](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/as-samoan-domain-name-registration-for-american-samoa), and [.bz](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/bz-belizean-domain-name-registration-for-belize) suffixes.

That leaves us with the remaining geo-targetable domain extensions from Google’s list: .ad, .cd, .dj, .sr, and .su. Unfortunately, we don't carry these domains because they're not easy to purchase and maintain, so you'd have to choose another registrar (our friends at [Domainr](https://domainr.com) may be able to help with that.)

***

Here’s the overall result if we were to rank the ccTLD's by international popularity, user recognition, and how easy they are to obtain:

- Best: .co, .me, .tv
- Good: .io, .fm, .ws, .nu
- Maybe: .la, .ms, .sc, .as, .bz
- Average: .ad, .cd, .dj, .sr, .su

Of course, it also depends on the type of website you are launching, but for businesses you should probably stick to the “best” and “good” categories.
