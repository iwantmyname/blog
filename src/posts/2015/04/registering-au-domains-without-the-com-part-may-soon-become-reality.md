As reported by [DomainIncite](http://domainincite.com/18367-australia-considers-dumping-the-com):

> Australian domain overseer auDA is thinking about allowing people to register .au domains directly at the second level for the first time.
> 
> The organization has opened up a consultation that would allow registrations such as example.au, rather than just the current system of example.com.au, example.org.au and so on.
> 
> The move follows the successful recent releases of 2LDs in the UK (.uk) and New Zealand (.nz) ccTLDs and can be seen as a bid to remain competitive in the face of the new gTLD program’s huge expansion of TLD choice.

That’s good news for Australian domain owners! Let’s just hope this also results in making it easier to obtain domains and not have people jump through hoops as with the current registration policies.

For example, .com.au currently requires you to provide a company ID such as and Australian Business Number when purchasing a domain name which makes it difficult for somebody just starting out. And individuals are not allowed to register .com.au at all but need to go with .id.au instead. However, domains under .id.au must either match your real name or be closely connected to you and might be declined if not. Talk about making it complicated!

Until then, Australians might as well consider other alternatives for their online identity like the [new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (or the recently mentioned [gccTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/04/reach-an-international-audience-with-these-country-code-top-level-domains.html)) which you can specifically target at local visitors.
