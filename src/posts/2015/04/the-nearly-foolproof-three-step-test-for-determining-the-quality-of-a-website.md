title: The nearly foolproof three-step test for determining the quality of a website
excerpt: no

![Twitter Logos]({{ site.images_url }}/2015-04-15-twitter-logo.png)

+ **Step 1:** Go to a website
+ **Step 2:** Find the social icons
+ **Step 3:** If the Twitter icon isn't shaped like the birds above (angled slightly up), you've probably found a brand that either doesn't understand the internet or doesn't care about details (possibly worse?).

***

*Note that there are levels of terribleness here.*

**Quality Score -100:** Definitely the wrong logo, but I can see how someone could see this and not instantly think it's wrong. If you see something like this on a personal site, politely send an email to the site owner.

**Quality Score -4000:** You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant with carpet clearly from the 1980's?
