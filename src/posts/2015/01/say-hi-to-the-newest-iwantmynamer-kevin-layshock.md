With 2015 now in full swing, we'd like to announce our newest additionâ€”Kevin Layshock. Over the course of the next year (decade(s)?), he'll be designing his way around the iwantmyname universe, buttoning up the website, redesigning our emails, improving our branding, and generally making everything a bit more friendly and usable.

If you want to say hi, you can find him on Twitter [@couthmonger](https://twitter.com/couthmonger). Conversation starters include: interesting UI/UX design, contemporary art, beautiful lettering, comic books, podcasts, good movies (only good ones), coffee, and of course, tasty beverages.
