*Our [App Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the "New in the Marketplace" blog series.*

Ladies and gentleman, podcasts are a thing now, and real people are listening to them. What was once a tiny community of hobbyists and public radio hosts is now an industry with hit shows being covered by national publications. But what makes podcasting magic is that there's virtually nothing stopping you from starting your own show and building an audience—all you need is a half-decent mic, a quiet room, and some simple editing software.

The biggest hangup I've seen lately though is hosting. Once you create your show and record some episodes, how do you get them online (and then to podcatchers like iTunes, Stitcher, and Overcast)? Well, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, [Simplecast](https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast) just might be perfect. With Simplecast, you get unlimited storage and a one-step file importer to build clean sites (using templates or your own design), collaboration tools to facilitate your future team (you know, for when you get big), and easy-to-understand metrics for seeing how you're doing. It's all pretty painless, giving you all the energy you need to post your show on a consistent schedule.

I'm not usually one to read too much into [About](https://simplecast.fm/about) page copy, but the message of simplicity on the Simplecast site really rings true:

> The story behind Simplecast is as simple as the platform itself…we needed it. After publishing multiple podcasts, the same issues kept popping up and we kept saying to ourselves that publishing podcasts had to be easier.
> 
> Podcasting is still pretty young as a platform and we hope to keep building a solid product that makes it easier for all of us. We asked ourselves what we would want in a podcasting platform and it was simple: try it out for free, don't limit bandwidth, manage everything in one place, get only the stats we need, allow multiple podcasts per account, and have a player that is easy to use and distribute.

If you want to try it out, [Simplecast](https://simplecast.fm) has a 14-day free trial, then is $12/mo (or $120/yr). Now I know there are a few free solutions out there for podcast hosting, but you often get what you pay for. Here's a tweet I often refer to from Merlin Mann (podcast extraordinaire):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just went to listen to a podcast hosted on Soundcloud and it added an extra-extra preroll ad.&#10;&#10;Guys. Hosting&#39;s cheap. Have a little dignity.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/549423128355426304">December 29, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
