*Our [App Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) is filled with dozens of great platforms you can add to your domain with just a few clicks (no DNS knowledge required), and in 2015, we’re looking to add a ton more. As we add new platforms to the list, you can get a little taste of what they offer here in the New in the Marketplace blog series.*

Starting a blog is quite the endeavor. It’s a commitment to consistent writing, creative thinking, and unending doubt as to whether or not you’re hitting your goals. But one think blog creators often overlook is the means for audiences to have conversations around your work. Too often, the commenting/forum tools used look like they were created in the late 90s, and often function in ways that discourage natural thought processes—and that’s something [Muut](https://iwantmyname.com/services/forum-hosting/muut) is trying to change.

Here’s a bit from the [Muut Manifesto](https://muut.com/manifesto/) (I always like a good manifesto):

> Muut is a radically different discussion platform that can be embedded on any website. It is unencumbered by the weight of unnecessary features and distractions, and places the conversation back to the forefront.
>
>A clean user interface, persistent content and a deep integration to the site will allow a more natural and meaningful discussion to take place, and enable people to focus on topics they care about. It’s a lightweight, super fast, and responsive platform that places minimal strain on data bandwidth.
>
>We’re on an important mission. A proper forums and commenting system will increase traffic on any given website, and the audience will stay longer. There is no sane reason not to have forums or commenting on a website.

In short, Muut is a clean, embeddable, customizable (no iframes), crawlable, responsive, realtime, worry-free conversation platform for your site. And best of all, you can [try it out](https://muut.com/pricing/) (for an unlimited amount of time, with unlimited bandwidth, users, and data… just a few limited features) for free.
