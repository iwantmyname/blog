[From Roland LaPlante - CircleID:](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150112_new_gtlds_show_promising_seo_performance/)

> With the arrival of hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), many marketers are excited that they can now get a web address that best describes their business or brand. For instance, a company in the organic business can now get a web address on .ORGANIC, or a brand that's all about passion and excitement can now get on .RED, etc. At the same time, many are also asking some important SEO related questions:
> 
1. Will Google crawl new gTLDs?
2. Will new gTLDs automatically score higher in Google's search algorithms?
3. What are the SEO best practices for migrating a site to a new gTLD?
4. Should brands REALLY get on new gTLDs and give up the status quo?
