We all know the rush for the last few presents a couple of days before Christmas. But why should you go to overcrowded shopping centers when you can shop online? With iWantMyName you don't even have to be afraid that it's not delivered on time. It's the 24th already? No worries, just [search for a domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/) and you'll have it within a couple of minutes.

Buying a personal domain name for your friends or relatives is the perfect Christmas gift. Here are some ideas to find a good name:

*   Get a .COM or .ME with first name (middle name) last name, e.g. [SantaNicholasClaus.com](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaNicholasClaus.com), [SantaNClaus.com](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaNClaus.com) or [HolySantaClaus.me](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=HolySantaClaus.me), [HolySClaus.me](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=HolySClaus.me)
*   Be creative with a [domain hack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack): [NicholasCla.us](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=NicholasCla.us) or [SantaLives.in](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaLives.in)
*   Register the Christmas domain .CX: [SantaAndTheReindeer.cx](https://iwantmyname.com/search/?domain=SantaAndTheReindeer.cx)
Add one of our [free features](https://iwantmyname.com/features/custom-domain-applications-and-dns) to it and the presentee can use his name immediately. 

The iWantMyName Team wishes Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
