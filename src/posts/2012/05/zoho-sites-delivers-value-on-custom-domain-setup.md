It's been a long time coming but Zoho have finally added a website builder to their suite of [hosted business services](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/zoho/email-hosting-and-online-office-suite). Nimble Zoho already had a fantastic offering with useful cross-platform functionality that has been nibbling at the heels of arch-competitor [Google Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain) for years, but now the circle is complete - so to speak. 

Back in the dark ages there was a giant server farm called Geocities that allowed budding web geeks to build and post their own websites. Geocities' death warrant was written the moment Yahoo got involved, but not before millions of us got a taste for creating and building sites and communities online. All this, years before social networks came to the fore. Today, building a simple website is a breeze, with the plethora of hosted [website builders](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/) that are now available.

[Zoho Sites](http://www.zoho.com/sites/) are heavily promoting the fact that their site builder provides instant optimization for mobile users and integrates with existing (and future) Zoho business tools. This will be especially interesting for small businesses looking to capture, monetize and track the fast growing mobile market. The easy drag and drop format will also interest micro-business users who are generally time poor and want to get up and running quickly. At $39 for a whole year, the paid plan looks very attractively priced and Zoho scores extra points for excluding ads from its free version as well.
