title: .UK Available For 1 Year, .IO 2-Letter Domains & May Promotions


----

The British registry [Nominet](http://www.nominet.org.uk/) recently reduced the minimum registration period for all .UK domain extensions ([.co.uk](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-british-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom), [.me.uk](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) and [.org.uk](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom)) to one year. As of today, any .UK domain purchase at iWantMyName will reflect this change and domains will be registered for one year only. The registration period of existing domains is not affected but subsequent renewals will occur on a yearly basis.

More good news for fans of short domain names! We now support [two-letter .IO domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) for customized URL shortening or your next website or app. These super short web addresses are available at only $79.00 USD in the first year.

Other currently running promotions this month are:

*   $12.00 [.INFO domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information)
*   $19.00 [.ME domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro)
*   $49.00 [.EC domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-ecuadorian-domain-name-registration-for-ecuador)
*   $85.00 [.FM domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia)

We also still offer great discounts on [domain transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) which also apply if you want to use our [free managed transfer service](https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice).
