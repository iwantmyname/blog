**Update 14/02/13**.

 Xtra is finally reviewing its partnership with Yahoo. Given there are so many other better webmail offerings around these days, it was inevitable. Xtra's latest problems with email simply underlines why we all need to take control of our virtual letterboxes. 

Much has been written about the unfortunate [decline](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/yahoo-decline/) of Yahoo and it's no secret that the company has been dogged by [technological challenges](http://archived.link/http://www.iitp.org.nz/newsletter/article/) and management unrest recently. All the more reason why Xtra customers should be concerned about being locked into a single service provider. Telecom cynically [flicked off](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4894091/Telecom-sells-YahooXtra-share) its half of YahooXtra to Yahoo7 a couple of years ago, leaving Xtra customers in the lurch somewhat. Customer support around Yahoo mail has reportedly been patchy ever since.

All of this strengthens the case for greater self-managment of your mail service. Rather then accepting a generic email address from your ISP, why not host your email on your own entirely portable domain? Fortunately there are a number of other excellent [hosted email solutions](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/email-hosting/) that are fully domain customisable with a single click of a button from within your iWantMyName dashboard. Here's [more information](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/233925-how-can-i-set-up-email-with-my-own-domain-) about setting up email on your domain. Get cracking and [register a personal domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) today.
