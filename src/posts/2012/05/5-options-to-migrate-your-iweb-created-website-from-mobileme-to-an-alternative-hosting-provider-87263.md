The end of MobileMe as you know it is near! While most services such as email, contacts or calendars found their way into iCloud, Apple will discontinue their iWeb publishing service on June 30th, 2012. This means your website created in iWeb will no longer work on Apple's old MobileMe platform and it's high time to switch to another hosting option.

As far as your domain name is concerned, in most cases you can keep it with your current registrar. All you have to do is change the DNS settings or nameservers in your iWantMyName (or any other registrar's) dashboard. For those of you currently using MobileMe's free web address, e.g. web.me.com/username/sitename we highly recommend to [register a domain name](https://iwantmyname.com). A domain stays with you as long as you pay for it and you can switch from one provider to another without having to change your web address.

###Option 1: switch to a hosted website builder (recommended)

If you can, move away from iWeb as your website creation software. This might sound difficult and definitely requires some work but now's the time to do so because Apple will not release new versions of iWeb in the future. Many types of desktop applications have been moved into the cloud over the last few years and website builders are no exception. So if you want a solution that is future-proof, you should consider one of these [hosted site builder services](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/) which let you manage all aspects of your online presence over the internet. Using this option, you will not have to download and install any software meaning that you always have the latest version and features at your disposal.

This is also the easiest solution in terms of changing the DNS settings of your domain name. If your domain is managed by us, all you have to do is select the service of your choice from the iWantMyName marketplace within your [dashboard](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps) and follow the instructions. For domains registered with another registrar, simply replace the MobileMe CNAME (web.me.com) with the DNS settings of your new sitebuilder.

Here are some of our staff picks:

More hosting options can be found in the [iWantMyName marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services):

### Option 2: pick a new hosting provider

Should you have to stick with iWeb, the good news is that any hosting company offering you FTP access to their servers will work. That's a pretty standard feature with all web hosting plans throughout the industry. However, there is one caveat when switching from MobileMe to standard web hosting and that is, you cannot use some Apple-specific features such as password protected pages, blog and photo comments or the visitor counter any longer. When choosing a new web host, don't worry about fancy stuff, e.g. included databases or programming languages supported. The only important thing is to pick a plan offering sufficient storage space and bandwidth, depending on the [size of your site created in iWeb](http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23830?viewlocale=en_US). Since iWeb is creating static HTML pages, the most basic package should do the trick.

We can recommend [NearlyFreeSpeech.NET](http://nearlyfreespeech.net) as they will only charge you for disk space and bandwidth that you really use. If you want to learn more about using iWeb's integrated FTP client, [this FAQ](http://iwebfaq.org/site/iWeb_Folder_FTP.html) can help.

Please note that using this option, you will most likely have to update the nameservers for your domain. This might require some additional planning if you're using email services under your own domain name.

### Option 3: choose a Mac-friendly hosting service

This topic has been covered by [Macworld](http://archived.link/http://www.macworld.com/article/1166270/switch_your_iweb_site_to_a_mac_friendly_web_host.html) earlier this month and everything mentioned in the previous paragraph applies here as well. There are a few [Mac-friendly hosting providers](http://www.machighway.com/mobileme.php) and some even support certain [MobileMe-specific features]( http://www.ragesw.com/blog/2012/05/18/from-mobileme-to-rage-web-hosting-alternative-ways-to-retain-some-mobileme-features/). A new company called MacMate [specializes in replacing MobileMe](http://macmate.me) and is also worth checking out if you're looking for a new home for your iWeb site.

### Option 4: use an alternative desktop app

iWeb surely is a neat application but as outlined before, Apple stopped development and there will be no future versions. There have always been great desktop alternatives and here are the two most popular ones.

- [Rapidweaver](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/overview/): powerful web design software for your Mac for beginners and advanced users. Lots of add-ons and themes available.

- [Sandvox](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox): you can try the software for free and the developers published a [guide for users switching from iWeb](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/from-iweb-to-sandvox.html).

Both applications have a built-in FTP client and can be used with the hosting options mentioned earlier.

### Option 5: backup your site on DropBox

This option should only be used as a last resort or backup solution but publishing your website on [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) is a free way to keep it online. However, there is a huge downside and that is the ugly and unmemorable web address. Sure, you could forward your domain name to the public Dropbox URL but it just looks unprofessional. Macworld has more information on [how to publish your site on Dropbox](http://archived.link/http://www.macworld.com/article/1166277/how_to_publish_your_mobileme_iweb_site_on_dropbox.html).
