It's hard to believe that this week already marks the 4th birthday of [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/). In 2008 we blew a raspberry at the economic recession and launched the coolest and easiest to use [international domain registrar](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) site on the planet. Judging by how fast we've grown globally, plus all the [positive feedback](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) we've received from customers, we must be heading in the right direction. It's been a lot of hard work, but also a great deal of fun.

To celebrate this momentous occasion we've taken a break from slicing birthday cake and took a knife to some of our domain prices instead! We've permanently reduced the cost on all [.com domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial), as well as [.net](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network) , [.org](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org-domain-name-registration-for-organisation) , [.name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/name-domain-name-registration-for-names) and [.info domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/info-domain-name-registration-for-information). Previously $24.90, these are now flying out the door at only $19.90. No need to manage your domains with an ugly offshore based provider - iwantmyname offers more than 100 different species of [domain names](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) chilled on tap, right here in New Zealand.

Sign up or [transfer your domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) to start enjoying the simplicity of our [New Zealand domain registrar](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) site. You not only get our famous personal customer service, but also New Zealand dollar denominated billing and a GST invoice for your records, each time you do business with us. You will also be supporting Kiwi built technology going global and bringing home the bacon by earning valuable, low carbon export dollars! That's something we are very proud of.
