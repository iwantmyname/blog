title: Iceland Haz Cheezburger?

We're not to sure if they do because both [cheezburger.is](https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=cheezburger.is&hideUnavailable=false) and [cheeseburger.is](https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=cheeseburger.is&hideUnavailable=false) are still available for registration. There seems to be an Iceland Cheeseburger Pizza though?!?

Now THAT sounds healthy! Anyway, as one of the most requested country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) at [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com), it is with great pleasure to announce the addition of the Icelandic domain extension to our [TLD family](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions).

[Iceland's ccTLD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland) can be registered at a yearly cost of $99 USD with [.is domain transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-domain-registrar-transfer-iceland) being free of charge. Please note that ISNIC, the Icelandic registry, has [special nameserver requirements](http://www.isnic.is/en/host/req). If you are planning to use different nameservers than our ns1/2/3/4.iwantmyname.net, please check with your nameserver or hosting provider first.

Since the .is namespace is rather small (41361 domains as of today), many great domains or domain hacks are still available. Make yourself a [domain Christmas present](https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift) and [get your Icelandic web address today](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/is-icelandic-domain-name-registration-for-iceland)!
