It has been an amazingly full and challenging year for us here at iwantmyname as we continued to win over new fans with our no-nonsense approach to domain management. Elsewhere, from [Hobbits](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html) to [hurricanes](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/why-your-domain-survived-the-sandy-storm.html) to [Halloween](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/10/scared-bitless.html), 2012 has been a rather eventful year globally as well. Now as the holiday season is almost upon us, you can rest easy in the full knowledge that we will still be on deck keeping 
a watchful eye on your domains.

During the year we launched a crisp [new design for iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/the-new-iwantmyname.html) including improvements in search speed and functionality. 2012 was also the
 year in which we witnessed hundreds of aspiring domain applicants preparing bids for the release of new top level domains. Some of the applications had merit, whilst 
others were downright [domain crazy](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/06/more-new-domains-wtf.html). We continue to monitor the process and will keep you informed if and when new domain spaces emerge.

We've got major plans for 2013 ourselves too, including additional development work on our 
customer dashboard. We're also doing our bit for the economic recovery by taking on more domain elves, plus we are planning a move to bigger and brighter premises as we continue our global growth. None
 of these things would have been possible without the support of our valued 
customers however. Apart from your domain business, we especially appreciate
 all of your [feedback](http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general).
 We want to make registering and managing a domain name easy and fun, so
 it really helps us to improve when we hear about our customers' 
experiences.
Best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season from the [iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.com/about)!

P.S. Stumped for gift ideas? Avoid shopping mall madness this season and [register a gift domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/personal-domain-gift) for friends and family.
