We're happy to announce the launch of our site redesign and new iwantmyname logo. As mentioned last week this refresh is a first step towards a new control panel which will speed up the interaction with your domains dramatically. We can't wait to share it with you!

**What has changed?**

*   A new logo designed by New Zealand based designer [Jarred Bishop](http://jarredbishop.info/) who you also might know as the developer of several [awesome Tumblr themes](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/04/3-awesome-simple-tumblr-themes-designed-by-jarred-bishop.html).
*   [Faster domain search](https://iwantmyname.com/search) with all [100+ domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains) on one single page.
*   The layout has been moved to Twitter's [Bootstrap framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), customized to our needs.
*   Small improvements to our [marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) and iwantmyname dashboard, mainly a new internal navigation.

We'd also like to thank [Wellington developers bit by bit](http://bitbybit.io) who have been working with us on the new site. And now what are you waiting for? Check out the new site and [domain search](https://iwantmyname.com)!
