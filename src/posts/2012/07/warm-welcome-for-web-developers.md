We are a major sponsor of [WDCNZ](http://wdcnz.com/) this year and (fortuitously) it coincides with the launch of our wonderful site redesign. Therefore, we thought it highly appropriate to celebrate this stupendous occasion by organising a pre-event [social function](http://up.org.nz/events/wdcnz_welcome_drinks) for Web Dev Con delegates at **5.00pm on Wednesday 1st August at Tap Haus, Cnr Victoria & Dixon Streets, Wellington**.

We especially want to welcome visitors from outside the region and also say a big thank-you to the [web developer](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) community who have been amongst our biggest supporters (and critics). The site migration has taken place and we'd love to get [feedback](http://feedback.iwantmyname.com/forums/8008-general) on the [new design](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) from all of you. As we [mentioned](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html) recently, we are only as good as the people around us and we are driven to provide the most friendly and easy to use service for global [domain registration](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) and management.

If you are a web developer visiting Wellington for WDCNZ, locally based dev or simply a recent customer of [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/), then we'd love to see you. We're getting some delicious (and rare) Parrot Dog ales sorted, so you'll need a secret code word to score a nice cold pint of local craft beer on us. Make sure you [register](http://up.org.nz/events/wdcnz_welcome_drinks) through Unlimited Potential, [drop us an email](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) or simply DM us on our [NZ Twitter](https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ) channel.
