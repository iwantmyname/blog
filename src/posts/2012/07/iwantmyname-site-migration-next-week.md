title: iWantMyName Site Migration Next Week

categories:
  - Announcement
  - Maintenance

---

In the week starting July 23, we're making some updates to our service. The changes will take about 24 hours and not involve any downtime of your domain names.

**What's changing?**

We're introducing a new logo, site design and [domain search](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/12/new-faster-domain-search.html) which is much faster and allows filtering of search results. There will also be small tweaks to our dashboard.

Here's a screenshot of the new home page:

**How will I be affected?**

Your domains will not be affected by the change. However, you might not be able to log in to our dashboard temporarily, purchase new domains or start a domain transfer.

If you need to make any changes to your domains (e.g. update DNS records) we recommend doing them before the migration begins on Monday, Jul 23.

**What's coming next?**

We continue our mission to make domain management a painless experience. The new design is a first step towards an improved dashboard which is currently under development. So stay tuned for more updates in the coming months!
