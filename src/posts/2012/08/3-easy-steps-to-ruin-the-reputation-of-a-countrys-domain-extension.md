We've recently announced a substantial [price increase for .TC domains](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/adamsnames-advises-extraordinary-price-increase-for-tc-registrations-and-other-changes-to-gd-vg-doma.html) and were even more shocked when we received further details from the new registry managers. As a registrar there is not much that can be done about such a change but we thought you should know what's sometimes happening in the background of the domain name industry.

First of all, some terminology. There are registrants (you as the domain owner), registrars (us or our suppliers) and registries (the body managing a certain domain extension). If you [order a domain through iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com), we pass it on to the source registry, e.g. Verisign for .COM and .NET or Adamsnames in the case .GD, .VG and the aforementioned .TC country code top-level domain (ccTLD).

Price increases are nothing unusual for domains, e.g. Verisign raised prices by 7% earlier this year. They do happen and -- although not always justifiable -- there are [many factors that determine TLD pricing](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/08/why-some-domain-extensions-are-more-expensive-than-others.html). However, the recent price increase by the .TC registry is nothing short of unbelievable, is not in the interest of domain owners and can only be seen as profiteering.

*So what's the big deal now, what changed?*

1. The .TC registry is currently offline and will re-open somewhen in October. That's right, no new .TC domains at present.
2. They have tripled prices for existing domains and new registrations for no apparent reason and without much explanation.
3. Short 2-letter domains now cost more than 3,000 British Pounds -- bad luck if you've used a domain since a couple of years already. You'll find yourself paying lots more suddenly.

Would you trust a domain extension that makes such changes? We certainly don't and consequently iwantmyname will no longer offer the registration of new .TC domains,  when the registry opens again in October.
