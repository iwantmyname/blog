It may be a small flightless bird with poor eyesight, but our national symbol has proven to be a popular choice amongst New Zealand domain name fans. Over 1500 [.KIWI.NZ domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/kiwi.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) were registered in the first hour of sales when the plucky little bird was released into the wild this week. 

Creation of the domain within the [.NZ family](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/co.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand) puts a blow torch on the [dot Kiwi registry](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/01/dot-kiwi-domain-takes-flight.html) which began a lengthy and expensive accreditation process for a new top level domain through ICANN earlier this year ([register your interest for .KIWI](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/dotkiwi)).

A number of customers have asked why we were not accepting orders from day one. The chief issue for us has been the provisional registration period which we could not implement due to the [restrictive domain policies](http://www.internetnews.me/2012/09/04/kiwi-nz-registrations-opening-september-11th/). We appreciate this has led to disappointment for some. So we'd like to make amends.

Sadly, Kiwis are a rare and endangered native bird species in New Zealand. For every .kiwi.nz domain registered through iwantmyname in September, we will donate $2 to the [Karori Wildlife Sanctuary Trust](http://www.sanctuary.org.nz/karori-sanctuary-trust/) towards their excellent Kiwi preservation work. **[Get your .KIWI.NZ domain today and help save kiwis in the wild](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/kiwi.nz-kiwi-domain-name-registration-for-new-zealand)!**
