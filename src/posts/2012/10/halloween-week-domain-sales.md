Since we did not have a pumpkin at our office for a photo, I proudly present you my first attempt of painting the versatile vegetable instead (as you can see I'm **really** good at it). It somehow reminds me of that horrendous clipart collection on 10 CDs that I bought in the 90s for my first website.

So should you have plans for a clipart revival [blog](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/), we've got the following great [domain sales](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) for you this Halloween &mdash; and beyond:
