The [origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) of Halloween are a little obscure with explanations varying from harvest festivals to paying homage to the recently departed. The celebration has evolved considerably over the centuries however, as it spread from Europe across the Atlantic and further afield. Scary costumes and regalia are dusted off each year to ward off evil spirits and fairies whilst gifts of food or sweets are given to appease pranksters. It's all harmless fun for the kids.

But what's going on in our government I.T. sector at present is way more scary than the scariest Halloween that you can ever imagine. [Revelations](http://publicaddress.net/onpoint/msds-leaky-servers/) that confidential internal files could be accessed through public kiosks at Work and Income New Zealand have caused embarrassment at the highest possible level within government. This hot on the heels of blatant impropriety around the manner in which Mr Dotcom was spied upon and arrested and a legion of ACC files and other documents from governmental agencies that ended up in the wrong hands - and that's just the cases we know about!

Whilst these stuff-ups make great media fodder, they also portray a steady decline in central government's ability to manage information, despite hundreds of millions of tax dollars that are spent on I.T. systems implementation and management every year. The most scary part of this train wreck is that, on the one hand permanent developer roles within the government sector have been reduced, whilst on the other hand offshore based multinationals continue to be awarded major government I.T. projects over smaller but equally competent local contenders. The crisis is more about culture, than it is about the actual technology however.

As we trudge towards a pan-government login protocol and greater provision of government services online, how far can we trust government agencies with our data? Rather than the government warehousing and controlling our personal data, perhaps citizens should manage their own case files, medical correspondence, legal notes and status updates in a neutral repository? Users then approve who is and who is not allowed to interact with it in the cloud. People of all ages and backgrounds have already embraced [hosted social media applications](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/social-network/) and have become very competent at using them in a similar fashion. It's not a perfect model, but it's a starting point.

It may seem like a radical solution. But we've reached the point where traditional thinking is clearly not working very well. We need some new ideas. As a company that provides [domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) and DNS management (the basic building blocks of the Internet) we think there is huge potential for a citizen-centric approach to information and [online personal profile](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) management. Imagine owning yourname.me where only you control who has access to your personal data? Secure [your own .ME domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) now and prepare for the revolution!
