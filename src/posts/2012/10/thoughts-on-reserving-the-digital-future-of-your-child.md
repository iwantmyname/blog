title: Thoughts On Reserving The Digital Future Of Your Child


----

Alexander Taub in Forbes' [The Mad Rush To Reserve Your Child's Digital Future](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2012/10/25/the-mad-rush-to-reserve-your-childs-digital-future):

> I've been noticing a trend over the past few months. I have a lot of friends who are having their first child. Many of these friends, especially the ones who work in the technology space, are reserving and managing the handles, email addresses, and websites of their newborns. They believe that when their child comes of age, the good handles, email addresses, websites, and digital accounts will be much harder to come by. By 2025, Jonathan.Smith@gmail.com or @jonsmith equivalents will definitely not be available. You may have to settle for @jonsmith13 or Jsmith13@gmail.com.

If you are planning to do this, start with the most platform-agnostic handle and [register the domain name](https://iwantmyname.com). Who knows what's the next hot social network, microblogging service or email provider? Domains, on the other hand, have been around longer than Twitter, Facebook and Gmail combined and there's a good chance they will survive any other form of online identity.
