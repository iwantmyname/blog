The craft beer craze is sweeping the country as micro-breweries pop up all over the show. Now some of the early craft brew pioneers are spreading their wings as well. Moa is doing a [trendy IPO](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10840093) and Tuatara just had their fantastic new facilities on the Kapiti Coast [opened](http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=49141) by a certain rather forgetful high profile politician. The beer scene is clearly undergoing a [Renaissance](http://www.renaissancebrewing.co.nz/) at present.

Earlier this year we [welcomed](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/07/warm-welcome-for-web-developers.html) the WDCNZ speakers and delegates with [developer](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) drinks at Tap Haus, including a special delivery of [Parrot Dog Brewery](http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2012/03/bitches-and-birds-startup-craft-beermakers-have-fu) product that everyone loved (ones to watch we reckon). What does all of this have to do with domains, you ask? Well, for starters, when you run a company with German co-founders, it's hard to avoid discussions about good beer. But apart from that, we also have some great beer domains on our books.

Our pal, former journalist Martin Craig, has been doing a wonderful job with [nzbeerblog](http://archived.link/http://nzbeerblog.com/). Sadly, he decided to get a real job this year, which has put a halt to any more humourous and informative articles, for the time being. But his blog remains packed with articles and advice about craft beer that is still relevant today. We also hooked up [The Brewhouse](http://www.thebrewhouse.co.nz/) with a domain. It's not a pub, it's an [online shop](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/ecommerce-hosting/) where you can purchase all your own beer making kit. If you are a fan of American craft beer, check out [BeerFellows](http://www.beerfellows.com/) report on the Great American Beer Festival which is going on this weekend. Finally, a plug for our neighbours over at [LBQ](http://littlebeerquarter.co.nz/) who not only have an amazing selection of [Emersons](http://www.emersons.co.nz/) on tap, but also a delicious German pretzel deal. 

Need a beer related domain? We have a selection of almost 100 [global domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) on tap. That only leaves us with one burning question remaining on a Friday afternoon. [Is it beer o'clock yet?](http://isitbeeroclockyet.com/)
