Remember the brightly coloured, tartan woolen blankets that your parents used to set up summer picnics on down at the beach? Those iconic blankies are now enjoying a second life as upholstering on recycled furniture. Brilliant idea, or what?

Elizabeth Cottrell, a lover of both classic furniture and wool, moved to New Zealand almost thirty years ago to start a family. As a sheep farmer's wife, living in the rugged hills above Taihape, she soon gained a powerful respect for the warmth and hardiness of woolen clothing and furnishings. From that respect sprang a cottage industry involving recovering and re-upholstering furniture using the very same woolen blankets. 

Our website of the month [Revival Furnishings](http://revivalfurniture.co.nz/) promotes a steady stream of recycled furniture in a vast array of shapes, sizes and patterns. The company built and hosted their attractive online brochure using [Cargo](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/cargo-custom-domain) a wonderful [website builder](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/website-builder/) application that is getting huge traction worldwide. Apart from being a brilliant Kiwi example of a [domain](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) branded home-made website, we love the way the company recycles classic furniture and makes it look uber-chic again.
