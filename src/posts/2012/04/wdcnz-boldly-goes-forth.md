If Wellington is the centre of the digital creative universe, then [WDCNZ](http://wdcnz.com/)  must surely be the natural focus point for the New Zealand web [software developer](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) community. And since iWantMyName is simply the coolest [domain management](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) service in the galaxy (and also based in the Capital) then it follows we'd "jump at light speed" for the chance to get involved, right? You bet!

WDCNZ explodes onto your screens again this August and will be even bigger and better then before. Being all about the real nuts and bolts technical knowledge that keeps the web humming, we're really chuffed to be a leading sponsor. Web Dev Con has some pretty amazing speakers lined up this year too, including local luminaries Vaughan Rowsell of [VendHQ](http://evanhugh.com/2011/08/10/vendhq-banks-funding-round/) fame, Aaron Morton and Silverstripe CTO Hamish Friedlander plus a very sharp looking contingent from offshore.

We reckon [tickets](http://archived.link/https://wdcnz-2012.lilregie.com/step1) will fly out the door, so don't muck around. You'd be "warped" not to be there. Oh yes...keep an eye on our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/iWantMyNameNZ) for updates on special offers and meetups related to this event.
