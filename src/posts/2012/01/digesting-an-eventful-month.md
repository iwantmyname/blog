title: Digesting An Eventful Month



----

February is shaping up as an inspiring month on the start-up, technology and innovation event calendar throughout New Zealand, illustrating that our tech scene is alive and well and continuing to grow. Here's a quick summary of what's on the menu.

The busy month kicks off with the [Game Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/playmaker/) in Auckland organised by [Playmaker](http://archived.link/http://playmaker.org.nz/) the proactive community for independent games developers. Main topic of conversation will involve finding out about all the cool games built during Global Game Jam. [Rails Camp](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/11/rails-camp-on-track.html) weekend is underway from 10th February with Ruby on Rails fans heading up to Mt. Cheeseman in Canterbury for their annual bush bash. The week of 13-17th Feb is reserved for [Webstock](http://www.webstock.org.nz/) so the [iWantMyName crew](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) will definitely be wandering over to the Wellington Town Hall to see who's rocking the world of web design and usability.

The following week the tables will be turned and it will be us in the limelight. We're shouting a few beers at [Unlimited Potential's Tech Founder Blast Talks](http://up.org.nz/events/tech_founder_blast_talks) and our CTO will also be speaking. Blast Talks looks like a big night out with some of Wellington's leading developers and tech company founders on hand. We are also getting right behind [Christchurch Startup Weekend](http://christchurch.startupweekend.org/), which launches on the weekend of 24th February. One or two of us will be on hand to provide some free [domain names](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) and offer coaching to help project teams get off to a good start. It's a small contribution we can make towards encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit to rise once again in the city.
