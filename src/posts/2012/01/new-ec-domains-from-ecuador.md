[![Ecuador Domain Name]({{ site.images_url }}/2012-01-30-Ecuador-Flag-128.png)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-ecuadorian-domain-name-registration-for-ecuador)

You can now register the [.EC domain extension](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-ecuadorian-domain-name-registration-for-ecuador) from the Republic of Ecuador. After .CO (Colombia) and .PE (Peru), it is the third TLD (top-level domain) from the northwest of South America in our ever growing [list of domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) at iWantMyName.

While the .EC web address is mainly used within the country itself, registration is open for businesses, organizations and private persons worldwide. This makes .EC an attractive domain for URL shorteners or vanity domains. New registrations and [transfers for the Ecudorian TLD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ec-domain-registrar-transfer-ecuador) are available at an introductory price of $79.00 USD.
