Excitement is mounting as [Christchurch Startup Weekend](http://christchurch.startupweekend.org/) draws closer. Once again we are looking forward to supporting the event, which kicks off on Friday, February 24th. 

The host city is about to embark on a rebirth of sorts after suffering an unprecedented series of devastating earthquakes that left the business district and many suburbs shattered and residents in shock. Building personal networks and cultivating a sense of hope through new entrepreneurship are two great ways to boost economic opportunities in the city - and Startup Weekend delivers admirably on both fronts.

We've had [loads of fun](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/11/usnapus-snaps-up-startup-weekend-prize.html) at previous Startup Weekends around New Zealand and through these events have been providing mentorship and [start-up advice](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/03/startup-weekend-resources.html) to young tech entrepreneurs as well as giving away free [domain registrations](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) to all the teams involved. Some of our [crew members](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) will be in Christchurch, so look out for the [iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) banner or let the organisers know if you need a domain for your brilliant Christchurch Startup Weekend project. We also recommend a bunch of cool [domain customisable developer apps](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/) that are great for getting you started.

Apart from enjoying ourselves immensely, engaging with events like Startup Weekend is part of our drive to get closer to our customers in the developer community. Good start-ups learn lessons from their users, so we love getting [feedback](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/support) (good or bad) as we evolve iWantMyName to meet your needs better. It's not too late to [grab a ticket](http://christchurch.startupweekend.org/tickets/) for this southern Startup Weekend. Hope to see you there!
