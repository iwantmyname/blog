The [.CO domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) launched at the end of 2009 and after only 18 months had already built a customer base of over 1 million registrations. That's astounding growth by any standard. But it's not all one way traffic for the perky upstart. The .CO registry is firmly focused on reaching out to and supporting entrepreneurs because it wants to be the new [.COM domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial) for business.

.CO is in fact the country code top level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Colombia. But the government of the South American nation handed over management of the domain to a joint venture company based in the United States. The company has backing from Neustar, one of the most experienced global registry technology providers ensuring that customers can have confidence in the security of their domain.

There is currently a great campaign underway [showcasing young entrepreneurs](http://www.go.co/case-studies/underthebulb/) that picked up .CO for their business domain and it tells the unique stories of how they dreamed up their .COOL idea. Those young business people are in good company. Some of the hottest technology companies in America are already using the .CO domain, including Twitter, 500 Startups and Google.

We couldn't resist joining the party too. So if you have a brilliant business idea and want to find your own fantastic .CO domain, simply hop over to our domain search page at [iWantMyName.co](http://iwantmyname.co/).
