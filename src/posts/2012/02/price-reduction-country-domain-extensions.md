We're constantly reviewing [our top-level domain range](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) to offer you the best domain and DNS management experience at affordable rates. Our philosophy is to reduce prices as we grow and pass on any savings we receive from registries or suppliers. That's why you can now enjoy cheaper domain registration for the following domain extensions:


*   .[CZ domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cz-czech-domain-name-registration-for-czech-republic): $35 → $30
*   [.FR domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france): $70 → $50
*   [.ES domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain): $35 → $25
*   [.LT domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lt-lithuanian-domain-name-registration-for-lithuania): $35 → $30
*   [.LU domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lu-luxembourgian-domain-name-registration-for-luxembourg): $45 → $40
This is a permanent price reduction for new domains and subsequent renewals.
