As you know, we are huge supporters of start-ups and small business in New Zealand and we've also [backed Startup Weekends](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/09/starting-up-new-zealand.html) since they began. So we are really pleased to be continuing these associations further by supporting next week's [Startup Party](http://www.meetup.com/Lean-Startup-Wellington/events/90958952/). 

We've got over 100 thirsty guests attending Startup Party at Wellington co-working space [BizDojo](http://bizdojo.com/) so we decided to get behind a new local start-up business that is [revving up](http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2012/03/bitches-and-birds-startup-craft-beermakers-have-fu) the Kiwi craft beer industry. We got in touch with the 'three Matts' from [Parrot Dog Brewery](http://parrotdog.co.nz/) and asked them to rustle up an ice cold keg of Parrot Dog Brewery's wonderful product. Across the road, BizDojo are busily preparing to host the event as part of their amazing ongoing support for start-ups, [user groups](http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/) and other business and tech related community initiatives. That's what we love about Wellington - everything is so handy, with small businesses tending to help each other out when the need arises. 

With [The Hobbit](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/11/in-the-domain-of-middle-earth.html) generating a huge amount of buzz around our film, games and animation sector, plus loads of small tech companies going global from the capital, there's a fantastic start-up, technology and innovation scene that is bubbling up with success right now. We are so confident about the future, that we are even [employing more staff](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/jobs/front-end-developer-wellington) at iwantmyname. That's why we will be celebrating at Startup Party. There will also be more information about [Wellington Startup Weekend 2013](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) plus some games and entertainment for laughs.

We're looking forward to shouting some start-up brews and catching up with loads of people before Christmas madness sets in. In the meantime, why not check out all the handy domain customisable [hosted services for small business](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/business/) we recommend in our app marketplace.
