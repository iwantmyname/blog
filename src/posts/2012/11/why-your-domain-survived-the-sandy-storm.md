Before co-founding [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/), I was employed as an aviation meteorologist, so the events of this week have been both fascinating and frightening as New York and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States endured a full frontal assault from Extra-Tropical Storm Sandy. Forecasts of the danger led to mass evacuations and shut-downs of key infrastructure such as airports, subway and power utilities. But how did Sandy get so damn big and is there a threat to Internet services and data security when disaster strikes in the future?

Sandy began as a late season hurricane originating near the Bahamas. Although the tropical storm barely made it to category 2 strength as it scooted past Florida, subsequent interaction with mid-latitude upper level systems and cold air from the north increased her ferocity. Energized by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream that flow along the east coast, the region experiences one or two major storms each year. Sandy was one of the largest recorded Atlantic storms by surface area and has similarities to Hurricane Floyd that deluged the north-east with rain in 1999. Hurricane Andrew (1992) and Hurricane Katrina (2005) gained greater infamy for wind strength and the extent of devastation wrought in the south of course. 

With climate change and the forecast increase in severity of storms, how robust is the Internet infrastructure that we rely upon daily? Preparedness and technical redundancy are issues that constantly prey upon the mind of operational teams at any fast growing Internet company and [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) is no exception. Consequently, we have our front end servers parked in several geographically remote locations globally. We also secure customer, domain and DNS record data externally with independent partners in Europe that have their own highly robust system architectures. System failure at any single location would never result in an irrecoverable loss of customer data or degradation of the existing DNS service on your domain.

Service providers who support key elements of the global Internet infrastructure and domain name system also have multiple layers of redundancy in place. For example ICANN was quick to [allay fears](http://blog.icann.org/2012/10/root-zone-ksk-vs-hurricane-sandy/) regarding handling of DNSSEC management based in its Virginia data center. Most hosted services in the affected area [coped well](http://blog.cloudflare.com/what-happens-when-a-hurricane-hits-the-web) despite some challenges. But the [reported outage](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/10/amazon-web-services/) at Amazon and [failures](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/30/hurricane_sandy_blog_death/) of some prominent blog sites suggests that the chief threat lies with individual [cloud based applications](https://iwantmyname.com/services) that may be a little over-reliant on a single server node. But losing access to your Pinterest or Instagram for a couple of hours is hardly a crisis in comparison to the severe trials being faced by residents of the North-East in the wake of the storm. Keep safe!
