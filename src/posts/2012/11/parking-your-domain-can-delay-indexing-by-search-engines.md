title: Parking Domains Can Delay Website Discovery By Search Engines

categories:

Google's [Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/) explains why you shouldn't park your domain right until the launch of your website:

{% include youtube.html id="eF8i6rKojXQ" %}

Some more tips from us:

* If you are using a registrar automatically connecting your domain to a parked page &mdash; with or without ads &mdash; disable the setting immediately (e.g. by removing the DNS records).
* Use a simple publishing tool such as [Site44](https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/site44-dropbox-hosting-on-custom-domain) or [Virb](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/virb-custom-domain) to quickly summarize what the website is about before launching.
* There are lots of other [free hosted services with custom domain option](https://iwantmyname.com/services/free-hosting) which can be used to announce your launch or build an audience.
