> The owner of @overcast on Twitter wasn't interested in selling, and I couldn't get it on Tumblr, Pinterest, or Facebook. So I registered @OvercastFM on Twitter, App.net, Tumblr, and Pinterest, and facebook.com/OvercastFM.2 I also took @overcast on App.net just in case, but I'm not going to use it unless I get the matching name everywhere else in the future — consistency between services is more important than having the best available name on just one or two of them.

>  I couldn't get the .com — its squatter wants $100,000,000 for it. That's right, a hundred million dollars. I tried to get him to come down a bit, and he said he'd take $95 million. I offered him $1,000, which quickly ended negotiations.

Take it from one of the brightest minds in the tech sphere—when naming a product or service, brand consistency is key. And there's nothing wrong with not using a .com name.
