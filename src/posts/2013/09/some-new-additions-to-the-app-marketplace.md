title: Some New Additions To The App Marketplace


----

<!-- excerpt -->

At iwantmyname, we're always looking to add great services to our [app marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services). And in these past few months, we've made a bunch of additions:

<!-- /excerpt -->

###enthuse.me

It's 2013, and for many people in creative (and even non-creative) fields, showing off what you know with a traditional resume just doesn't cut it. To get ahead, you need an online presence to show off all your best work and accomplishments. And that's what enthuse.me sets out to do. Through an incredibly simple interface, [enthuse.me][1] lets you create a one-page profile of yourself, with handy tools for linking in your content from all around the web. 

###Jumpstarter

It's all about "coding with flow." With [Jumpstarter][2], all of your development environments, framework installs deployment and hosting are wrapped into a nice, tidy package. And with the ability to instantly clone/fork your entire application state, you can experiment and play with apps just like you can on GitHub today.

###strikingly

We're to the point know where even the least tech savvy of us are using high-end mobile devices. But when you look at the vast majority of sites on the web, mobile clearly takes a back seat. Well, with [strikingly][3], you can create a mobile-optimized "one-pager" in minutes—perfect for small businesses who have no (or a very outdated) web presence.

###Dunked

Like enthuse.me, [Dunked][4] is a modern portfolio site built primarily for creative folks. But unlike enthuse.me, Dunked lets you build full-on, multipage portfolios. The basic package gives you 50 pages. 500 images. Full HTML and CSS editing. SEO optimization. And it's all beautifully responsive, optimized for both standard mobile devices and modern Retina displays. 

###Roon.io

Utilitarians rejoice! [Roon][5] is a blogging platform that takes all the BS out of the picture. No dealing with code, setup, social gimmicks or unnecessary blogging features. Just a simple, Markdown-based writing platform meant to give writers the means to write. Quickly. 

###BitBalloon

Have you built a painfully simple static site, with no moving parts or complicated tidbits? Interested in "optimizing the hell out of it," then deploying it with possibly the world's easiest drag-and-drop deployment method—with working forms built with ordinary HTML? It sounds like [BitBalloon][6] is for you.

###CloudCannon

Having a CMS is nice. But having a simple CMS that harnesses the power of Dropbox to deploy sites as fast as a cannon (sorry), is even better. With [CloudCannon][7], you can "turn your HTML and CSS into a hosted CMS in seconds," just by uploading your files to a Dropbox folder. Best of all, CloudCannon gives you unlimited storage and bandwidth, so growing your site will never be an issue. And did we mention it's fast?

###Mad Mimi

For being as mad as Mimi claims to be, [Mad Mimi][8] really is a delightful email marketing company. And what makes them great is that they their service isn't tied to a corporate agenda—it's just a robust platform built to deliver better, more friendly emails that people might actually want to read. Now doesn't that sound nice?
