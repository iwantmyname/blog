Let's talk a bit about Chile, home of our newest ccTLD, .CL. Hugging the western coast of South America, Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, known for towering mountains, stunning fjords and some of the best wine on the planet. (It's also the fictional home of [Gus Fring][1], but I'm sure they don't advertise it.)

Anyways, for [$79/annually][2], you can now claim your own small slice of this great nation--but let's be .CLear, you'll have to be .CLever to make your name special. Here are a few domain hacks already in use to help you get your mind going:

<!-- /excerpt -->

so.cl, un.cl, mus.cl, cir.cl, cubi.cl arti.cl, vehi.cl, chroni.cl, motorcy.cl, parti.cl, popsi.cl. (recepta.cl and recy.cl are currently open!)

Brilliant .CL domains are being scooped up fast, so pour yourself a tasty Malbec and [register your Chilean name today][2].
