If you are involved with product development, design or user experience in any way at all, then you will love [UX Design Day](http://uxdesignday.org/wellington/) which is coming to Wellington very soon. The local speaker line-up reads like a who's who of our web design glitterati, including Philip Fierlinger (Xero), Ruth Brown (TradeMe) and the fabulous Philippa Dawe from design agency Alexander Rose. Keynoting is Wesley Yun, Samsung's U.S. based creative director.

At iwantmyname, we are playing a part in improving design and usability in our little corner of the web world too, so it's no surprise that we are looking forward to sending a big delegation along to this event. From gigantic [domain name search](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) boxes to one-click DNS setup through our [apps marketplace](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services), we're pushing hard to make choosing and registering a domain name easy and fun. But don't take our word for it - check out what everyone else is saying [about iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about).

We think usability and good design are uber-important in business (and life generally). That's a philosophy we'd like to cultivate in young people too. So we've got **two student tickets to give away** for this amazing event. It's really easy for students to enter. **Just mention @iwantmynamenz and @uxdd <u>together</u> in your Twitter feed before October 1st and tell us why you'd love a ticket to the event.**
