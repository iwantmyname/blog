title: I Want My gTLD
----

<!-- excerpt -->

The new [generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are coming][1], and many of you are already showing interest by asking to be notified when certain extensions become available. So, like any interested party with a fascinating bit of data, we made a top ten list. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

We went in expecting some of the seemingly obvious extensions to garner the most interest—gTLDs like .app, .blog and .news—but we certainly didn't anticipate .church being the second most requested extension on the list. Or .music not making the list at all. It'll be interesting to see the actual usage data once the gTLDs go live. 

Will .kiwi will be world's top selling gTLD? Will drinkers choose .wine over .vodka? Will mom bloggers far and wide change their domains to .mom? We shall see.

Without further ado, here's the list:

1. [.app](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app)
2. [.church](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-church)
3. [.design](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-design)
4. [.blog](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog)
5. [.web](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-web)
6. [.nyc](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nyc)
7. [.art](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-art)
8. [.kiwi](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi)
9. [.shop](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-shop)
10. [.tech](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tech)
