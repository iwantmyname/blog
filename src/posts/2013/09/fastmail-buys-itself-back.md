From the [FastMail blog][1]:

> In 2010, [FastMail][2] was bought by Opera Software. The developers and staff of FastMail have now bought back the company. This means that FastMail is once again an independent company, dedicated to building the best possible email experience for our users. We have big plans for the future, and we will continue to roll out new features and enhancements over the coming months.

At iwantmyname, we definitely have a soft spot for independent companies, because nothing beats the innovative thinking and agility independence brings. So good luck to the teamâ€”we're excited to see what the future brings.

And here's an extra little tidbit from the FastMail team, 

> Tell your friends that there's a real alternative to the big corporations. One that doesn't show ads, respects your privacy, and is fully committed to keeping the service going forward.
