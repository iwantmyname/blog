<!-- excerpt -->

Coming from a guy who wanted to change his name to Bowser (or Rambo) from ages 6 to 12, I fully understand how hard it is to nail down a domain name. Do you choose something descriptive? Something creative? Something that spells a word using a domain extension like [.ch][1], [.es][2] or [.se][3]?

No matter what you come up with, you'll probably second guess yourself a number of times—which is no big deal before you buy the domain name. But once you make your purchase, the domain is yours for a full calendar year. See, once your domain is registered through the authoritative registry for your desired extension (like Verisign, which controls the [.com][4] and [.net][5] extensions), domain registrars like [iwantmyname.com][6] are not able to resell them back to the source. No take-backs, as they say.

So what do you do if you pick something you don't like? Here are some ideas.

<!-- /excerpt -->

###Learn to love it.

Like my pre-teen self, I knew I was stuck with my name for the long haul. There were some rough times, but now I can safely say I'm happy with the name I was given. The accumulation of my actions over time have made my name into something I'm proud of. And once it sinks in, your domain name might be something you're proud of, too. 

Next time you question your name, just think of all the hugely successful businesses out there with names that could've easily been second guessed. Apple. Yahoo! Twitter. The list goes on and on.

###Save it for something else.

Sometimes the problem with a name is that it's just not right for what it's being used for. But it's still a good name—one you can easily use for your *next* big thing. So hold onto it for the year (or forever), you never know when opportunity will strike.

###Buy a new one.

Sometimes the trick to truly being happy is to be more like Prince. The musician. Instead of getting stuck with a silly conventional name, he just changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol. The "Love Symbol." 

Unfortunately, your domain name is stuck in a slightly smaller box (no symbols... yet). But don't let that get you down--there are millions of domain names available (like thisisthebestcompanynameever.com—available now until it's gone), with more [unique domain extensions][8] being added all the time. Just be sure to turn off the auto-renew on your old name so you won't be stuck with it at the end of the year.

So get out there and find something you love. You deserve it. And because we're nice, [here's a spectacular link][7] to help you out with your search.
