<!-- excerpt -->

As a New Zealand-based domain registrar, it's only proper for us to officially start our generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) pre-orders with [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi)--the coolest little TLD on the planet.

<!-- /excerpt -->

From [Dot Kiwi](http://dot-kiwi.com/about-us):

> For the first time New Zealanders have a unique way to take pride in their Kiwi-ness online. It's called .kiwi ('dot kiwi').
>
> We believe the .kiwi domain will be hugely valuable for Kiwi businesses, opening the door to greater branding creativity and creating more opportunities for companies to differentiate themselves from competitors. 

So if you'd like to lay claim to your own piece of beautiful New Zealand, here's how you can do it:

* First, head over to to our [new gTLD page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) and select your desired extension. [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi) is the only one currently offering pre-orders, but more will come very soon. 
* Enter the domain you want, then click the "I want this domain >" button.
* Next, either enter your email address or sign in to complete the pre-order process.
* Once the TLD goes public, we will notify you of your domain pre-order status/next steps.

Note that this pre-order is an expression of interest and **does not guarantee** you your desired domain name. Once the pre-order process ends, your domain will go into a lottery with other internal name applicants, then will be submitted against other registrars for final selection. For some of the more popular names (domains like *chris.kiwi*), your selection will come down to a bit of luck, but we'll do our very best to get you the domain you want. We will keep you updated about any further details, such as the different launch phases and pricing, as soon as these come to hand.

Good luck, and have fun [pre-ordering your .KIWI domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi)!
