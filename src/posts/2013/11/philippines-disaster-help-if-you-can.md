<!-- excerpt -->

As you will no doubt be aware, the Philippines has suffered what is possibly its worst natural disaster in recent history with the passage of Super Typhoon Haiyan. If you have any doubt about the enormous power unleashed by this storm, check out [this BBC video report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24906576) filmed during the onslaught, when winds were reportedly gusting over 300 km/hr! The full extent of the disaster is not yet clear, with reports of a death toll anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 and literally millions displaced. So, how can we help?

<!-- /excerpt -->

As a Pacific rim nation, not unfamiliar with natural disasters ourselves, I'm sure we can all empathise with this tragedy. But we may also feel a little powerless to help. We were delighted to add the [Philippines domain](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/ph-domain-added.html) to our offerings a while back, so it only seems right to contribute something back. Children suffer greatly in times of disaster, so we've made an immediate cash donation to UNICEF. This is a relief agency established under the auspices of the United Nations to support children at risk globally. The New Zealand Red Cross have a [dedicated fund](https://www.redcross.org.nz/donate/typhoon-haiyan-appeal) aimed at getting resources into the affected region and you can also donate securely and anonymously to a number of aid agencies using the [Givealittle](http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=2663) platform. 

Only time will tell how this tragedy will unfold, but it's hard not to feel great concern for a nation which has already suffered substantially this year with numerous storms and earthquakes. As a business based in the Asia-Pacific region we feel a social responsibility to contribute; something that we have backed up by [participating directly](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/iwantmyname-helping-cambodian-schools.html) in aid programmes in the past. I hope you will join us and give what you can. Even a small amount can go a long way in times of need.
