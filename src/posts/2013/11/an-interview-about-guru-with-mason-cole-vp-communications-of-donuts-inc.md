<!-- excerpt -->

Much to our surprise, .GURU is the single most popular [generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) pre-ordered so far on iwantmyname. So we went to the underlying registry, Donuts Inc., to ask a few questions.

<!-- /excerpt -->

**iwmn:** Hi Mason, thanks for doing this with us. So first off, tell us a bit about .GURU. What's its origin story?

**Mason:** Donuts examined about 3,000 potential gTLDs for which to apply and narrowed that list to our eventual 307. According to the data we examined, there's pretty good demand in the market for various specific domain names, including .GURU. It's not that we had a particular affinity for the term (though we do like it) -- it's more that we learned there are potential registrants who would like to use the name for all kinds of reasons. And we're in the business of supplying new and varied Internet identity options.

**iwmn:** We've seen a surprising amount of interest in .GURU specifically--how much realistic growth potential do you see there?

**Mason:** Well, your numbers are telling you the story.  Suffice to say we would not have put $185,000 into an application if we didn't think it had a reasonable amount of potential.

**iwmn:** A lot of people are excited about the new gTLDs, but we've seen quite a bit of cynicism online. Do you think the world is ready? Will these gTLDs succeed in "categorizing the web?"

**Mason:** Yes, the world is ready. The cynicism, we believe, is unwarranted and probably comes with the discomfort in general associated with disruption. When you have a worn out and tired .COM namespace with no reasonable naming options left, new and specific, relevant identity opportunities will be very welcomed.

**iwmn:** From a marketing perspective, what would be the biggest win for .GURU? A successful blog using the TLD? A startup website?

**Mason:** Our measure of use success is that applied by the registrant. If a registrant puts .GURU to use in a way that's productive for his/her needs, it's a win.

**iwmn:** The internet is quite an interesting place, but I think it'll get much more interesting once .COM isn't the norm for the "everyday web surfer." What obstacles do you think need to be overcome to get us there? And what can the early tech adopters do to help?

**Mason:** It's going to be a little while at least until the typical registrant learns the ins and outs of new gTLDs. That's to be expected. That said, new gTLDs will be far more intuitive and relevant to those who are looking for specificity in describing products, services, activities, information, etc. Some early adopters will make their registrations extremely prominent in their advertising and consumer-facing communications. That kind of validation will help ease new TLDs into broad use.
