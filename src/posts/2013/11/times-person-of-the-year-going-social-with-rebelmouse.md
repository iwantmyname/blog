[From Time:](http://poy.time.com/2013/11/25/time-partners-with-twitter-to-launch-times-person-of-the-year/?xid=gonewsedit)

> TIME will also be incorporating Vines, Twitter's 6-second video product, into its Person of the Year walk-up, with celebrities, politicians and other influential people weighing in on who they would choose. Readers can submit their own Vine videos using #TIMEPOY as well, and they will be collected on a RebelMouse page and featured on Time.com. Twitter will also tweet about #TIMEPOY from Twitter's main accounts.
>
>  The announcement of the TIME Person of the Year will be made by TIME managing editor Nancy Gibbs on NBC's Today Show on Wednesday, December 11, coinciding with the news breaking on Twitter from [@TIME](https://twitter.com/time).

While not a social platform itself, [RebelMouse](https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/rebelmouse-custom-domain) gives you the ability to aggregate all of your social accounts into one custom site. All your Facebook posts, Tweets, Tumblogs, Pinterest pins and a number of posts from other platforms. It also lets you expand on social posts--such as turning "an Instagram photo into a full blog post (with) relevant tweets and other links."

Using RebelMouse, TIME's [2012 TIME Person of the Year page](http://poy.time.com/2012/12/19/social-reactions-to-times-person-of-the-year/) was definitely cool stuff--and the 2013 page looks to be even better. Be on the lookout for new #TIMEPOY posts soon on [poy.time.com](http://poy.time.com).

**Extra Credit:** RebelMouse was also one of [TIME's 50 Best Websites of 2013](http://techland.time.com/2013/05/06/50-best-websites-2013/slide/rebelmouse/). Maybe it's time to [start a RebelMouse site](https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/rebelmouse-custom-domain) of your own?
