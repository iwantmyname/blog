**iwmn:** Dr. Crockett, thanks for doing this with us! So I'll jump right to it--Spark is really really cool, and we think more people should know about it. Give us the rundown.

**Zachary:** We make tools to help people build internet-connected hardware products. Our first product, the Spark Core (video above), is a small development kit for a hardware product with a Wi-Fi connection. Think appliances, toys, home security and monitoring. It's a fork of Arduino, so folks who have done hardware prototyping with an Arduino would be comfortable with the Spark Core.

**iwmn:** Your domain is also quite cool--[spark.io](https://www.spark.io). Tell us a little about how you guys came to choosing a .io domain.

**Zachary:** .io domains are being used more and more frequently in the world of developer tools, and since that's what we're building, .io seemed very appropriate for us.

**iwmn:** What would you tell another site owner looking into a non-.com domain?

**Zachary:** I think the stigma around non-.com domains is gone because there are so many great start-ups using other TLDs. However there are still "cool" and "not cool" TLDs, and they vary by industry.

**iwmn:** And what about Kickstarter? We've seen some amazing projects come through with Kickstarter funding--how was that process? Exciting? Horrifying?

**Zachary:** Exciting :-) Kickstarter is a wonderful vehicle to launch a product, and the [Kickstarter community](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible) is so supportive. We've gotten incredible feedback from our backers that have made our product so much better.

**iwmn:** It looks like the target shipment date for Spark Core is November 18th? Where can we get one?

**Zachary:** Pre-order now at [spark.io](https://www.spark.io)!
