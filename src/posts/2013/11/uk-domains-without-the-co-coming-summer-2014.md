<!-- excerpt -->

It's always interesting to look through the different country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs). You see tons of countries with great two-letter domains, [.ES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain) for Spain, [.DE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany) for Germany, [.CA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada) for Canada. But then when you get to the UK, you're stuck with .CO.UK, .ORG.UK and a few other two-part extensions. Until now.

[From Nominet:](http://www.nominet.org.uk/news/press-releases/nominet-introduce-shorter-uk-domain-name-registrations)

> From summer 2014, shorter, simpler 'example.uk' domain names will be available for the first time alongside 'example.co.uk', 'example.org.uk' and so on. This represents the biggest modification of the .uk namespace since it began.
>
>  Any unique 'example.uk' domain name (e.g. one that does not have an equivalent name already registered as a .co.uk or a .org.uk) will be available on a first-come, first served basis from launch.

An official announcement with the definitive launch date will come by February 2014, so check back here for all your your up-to-date news on the .UK launch.
