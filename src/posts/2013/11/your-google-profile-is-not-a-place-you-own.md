title: Your Google+ Profile Is Not A Place You Own

categories:

Via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6698821): [Why I won't use a G+ custom URL](http://blog.vrypan.net/2013/11/08/why-i-wont-use-a-gplus-custom-url/)

> A URL is an identifier. I'll use it to identify myself on this service. I'll link to it from my website. I may print it on a business card. Like Google said in their email, I'll use it to "point folks to my profile". But they can take it away for any reason or decide to charge me a (yet unknown) amount of money in the future?
>
> No way. I'll stay with my current, unfriendly one, https://plus.google.com/107350252619396782277/.
>
> I'll do it to prevent myself from using it as an identifier. If you want to find me on Google+, "go to www.vrypan.net and follow the Google+ link".
>
> I'll also do it as a reminder, that Google+ is not a place I own, it's a place Google is kind enough to let me visit and have some limited activity, but they can always kick me off or ask for an (unspecified) rent.

We've said it before and will repeat it again: [your username tied to another domain simply does not belong to you](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html).
