<!-- excerpt -->

The first thing that becomes strained when you work for a company that promotes offsite working is organization. Updates, newsletters, product rollouts--the pieces of the puzzle that make your brand tick--can easily fall behind if you don't keep things in an orderly fashion. But now, the online tools available for internal communication and idea management have made needing a centralized office less important than ever.

<!-- /excerpt -->

And one of the best examples of these tools is [Trello](https://trello.com), "a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process."

For iwantmyname, we find Trello to be especially useful for organizing our blog, and it's all done with only four lists: *Ideas*, *Researching*, *Editing*, *Publish*. 

Basically, when a team member comes up with an idea we should write about, they open a card in the *Ideas* list. In that card, they can assign the idea to a certain person, leave comments to get conversations going, add checklists for idea organization, and even attach relevant files. 

Then, if an idea is chosen, the card is dragged and dropped into the *Researching* list, where it stays throughout the writing process. And again, if any information is needed, additional comments can be left on the card which notifies all the people attached.

From there, we drop in a Dropbox link of the first draft and place it in *Editing*, where a good 25% of the magic happens. Usually. Then the card goes to *Publish*, where we toss the content into our CMS for the world to see. 

It's like magic, and with only a fraction of its [overall feature-set](https://trello.com/tour) used, Trello has completely revolutionized our blog management structure. We definitely recommend giving it a shot. 

**Update:** I was reminded today that we adopted our Trello blog strategy [from this post on Pingdom](http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/07/30/trello-blog/). It contains a much more in-depth look at what the process entails, so definitely check it out if you're interested in the platform.
