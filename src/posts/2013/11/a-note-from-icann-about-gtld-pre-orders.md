title: A Note From ICANN About gTLD Pre-Orders

categories:
  - Pre-order

<!-- excerpt -->

This week, we started pre-orders on our very first generic Top Level Domain (gTLD), [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi). And while it's a very exciting occasion for us, as well as the internet community as a whole, we can't emphasize enough that gTLD pre-orders are not a guaranteed reservation. We've put a visible disclaimer on all gTLD pre-order pages, but here's a recent blog post from ICANN that reinforces the rationale. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

From [ICANN](http://blog.icann.org/2013/11/pre-reserve-a-domain-name-or-not-icann-answers-the-question/):

> As responsible Registrars are advising, successful pre-registration of a domain cannot be guaranteed. ICANN seconds that advice, cautioning that registrants should be wary of anyone who claims to be able to guarantee a domain registration on a new gTLD. There are several situations that can impact the availability of a domain name and some domain names may never be available for purchase. Instances that can impact availability of Second-Level Domains include: 

> + **Multiple Registrars per generic Top-Level Domain**

> Many gTLD Registries contract with multiple Registrars to provide registration services to Internet users. The Registrar you pre-register with may not be the Registrar that eventually registers the name. 

> + **Trademarked Names**

> Rights holders that have submitted verified trademarks will be given priority access to request domain names related to their trademarks. 

> + **Auction of Premium Names**

>Some Registries may choose to offer perceived premium names for registration to the highest bidder before they're made available to the general public, so some of these names may not be available. 

> + **Name Collision**

>Certain Second-Level Domain names must be blocked by Registries because their activation could potentially impact the operations of some private domains. 

> + **Some gTLDs may not be delegated** 

There is no assurance that ICANN will sign Registry Agreements for all of the new gTLDs for which applications have been submitted, nor is there any assurance that all of the new gTLDs will be delegated. If you pre-register a desired domain name and the underlying gTLD is not delegated, that domain name will not be available to you.
