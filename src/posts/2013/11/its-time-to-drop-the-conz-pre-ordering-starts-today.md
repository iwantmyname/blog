title: "It's Time To Drop The .CO--.NZ Pre-Ordering Starts Today"


----

<!-- excerpt -->

Say you're a business in New Zealand currently using a .CO.NZ address. It's probably been fine up to now, but does your domain name really need to resemble an advanced medical degree? Perhaps it's time to drop the extraneous letters. Get rid of the .CO. Liberate your domain name!

<!-- /excerpt -->

Whatever your reason for wanting a .NZ domain, [pre-orders have begun](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz), and now is the very best time to get the one you want. [As with .KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/pre-orders-now-open-for-kiwimore-gtlds-coming-soon.html), the process is simple:

+ Enter the domain you want, then click the "I want this domain >" button.
+ Next, either enter your email address or sign in to complete the pre-order process.
+ Once the TLD goes public, we will notify you of your domain pre-order status/next steps.

**Please note:** This pre-order is simply an expression of interest and does not guarantee that you will secure your desired domain name. Exact details are still to come, but we expect that owners .CO.NZ, .NET.NZ and .ORG.NZ will have grandfathered first access to claim their existing domains as .NZ. We will keep you updated about any further details, such as the different launch phases and pricing, as soon as these details are announced. The iwantmyname team is attending the .NZ Registrar Conference in Wellington today and we are hoping to have more information very soon.

So what are you waiting for? [Pre-order your .NZ domain today](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz)!
