title: iwantmyname does not register domains you have searched for on our site. EVER.

We've been flying a bit under the radar for a couple of years but as we grow (iwantmyname is now serving 40,000 customers!) it's only natural that some of the domain industry myths such as front-running are thrown at us. In case you didn't know, front-running is "the practice whereby a domain name registrar uses insider information to register domains for the purpose of re-selling them or earning revenue via ads placed on the domain's landing page" &mdash; [more on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_front_running).

Now let me be absolutely clear. We don't do such things! In fact, [GoDaddy debunked the myths around front-running](https://web.archive.org/web/20130826042820/http://inside.godaddy.com/front-running-debunking-myth) based on some search logs:

> As unique as customers believe their domain name ideas are, there's more "innovation collision" than many people realize. With so many domain name registrations happening every day, there is a good probability a domain name you searched for is also being searched by someone else.

That's all there is to it.

We even go a step further at iwantmyname and don't participate in any aftermarket practices at all. Questionable activities of other service providers such as parking unused domains or upselling a wheelchair to your grandma to squeeze the last bit of revenue out of customers is the very reason why we started our company a little more than 4 years ago.
