Last week, with the colder weather driving people indoors, we had a few friends over for a quiet celebration...as you do. It's been five years since we first formed the company and started writing code to develop [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/); so we really wanted to thank a bunch of people who had helped along the way with advice, support or the odd bit of work that kept us going as we built up the business.

Many start-up companies fall by the wayside long before year five, so it's a testament to a lot of hard work from the [iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) plus the loyalty (and patience) of our foundation customers that has driven us forward thus far. Apart from creating new jobs and contributing to the economic recovery we always had a sense that we wanted to build a next generation [domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) registrar that customers would love and that actually solved some real pain for them.

We also wanted to be deeply engaged in our local community and give something back to the people that got behind us from the outset. We really love that we are in a position to do so and remain big fans and supporters of [Startup Weekend here in Wellington](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) and all across New Zealand. We also help out with several tech meetups such as [PHP User Group](http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Usergroup-Wellington/), [Growth Hacker Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/No-Bullshit-Web-Marketing-Meetup/), [Wellington.js](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/), [Hackers and Founders](http://www.meetup.com/Hackers-and-Founders-Wellington/), [Perl Mongers](http://wellington.pm.org/) and [Unlimited Potential](http://up.org.nz/). As well, we've recently been involved with a number of initiatives promoting Wellington globally as a digital creative city.

Keep in touch with the [iwantmyname New Zealand blog](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/) or through the event listings in the New Zealand [Startup Digest](http://startupdigest.com/). You never know where we might pop up. Keep Warm.
