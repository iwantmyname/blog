It's been all over the tech news as [Yahoo! acquired Tumblr for a whopping $1.1 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/its-official-yahoo-is-buying-tumblr-for-1-1b-promises-to-keep-it-independent/) this week. Now the big question is will the internet <del>dinosaur</del>giant keep [their promise not to screw it up](http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/50902274591/im-delighted-to-announce-that-weve-reached-an) and let the blogging service blossom as a standalone product or is it going to be neglected like so many other bought-out services after a while? How will Tumblr change when they are required to integrate more closely with other Yahoo! properties or ads will start popping up on your site?

In the short term, you probably shouldn't be worried. You can actually be relieved because Tumblr was reportedly running out of money pretty fast and Yahoo! has the financial means to continue operation. So as long as Tumblr works for you as a publishing tool keep on using it.

However, now would be a good time to check out some alternatives -- preferably with import functionality for your Tumblr posts:

*   WordPress lets you [import Tumblr to WordPress.com](http://en.support.wordpress.com/import/import-from-tumblr/) or [WP Engine](http://wpengine.com/2013/05/why-move-from-tumblr-to-wordpress-ownership-and-creative-control/) as an alternative.
*   Help to import [Tumblr posts to Squarespace](http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/761100)
*   New open-source blogging engine Ghost will be launching with a [Tumblr importer](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform/posts/485933) (you should [support Ghost on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform))
*   For the geeks there's a general [Tumblr to Markdown exporter](https://github.com/skywrite/sky-tumblr-export) and static blog generator [Jekyll offers a Tumblr importer](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/) too.

We're sure there will be more services coming up with Tumblr importers in the next few months.

You should also ask yourself the question wether you want to go with a closed platform like Tumblr again or use an [open-source alternative](https://iwantmyname.com/services/open-source/) such as WordPress, Drupal or [Ghost](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/looking-past-wordpress-how-ghost-could-change-the-web.html) that allow you to fully own your data. Also, make sure that you always use a custom domain name because [your username on any closed service doesn't belong to you](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/02/your-usernames-do-not-belong-to-you.html). Whatever you decide, the iwantmyname marketplace is always a good starting point to [find a web publishing platform that fits you](https://iwantmyname.com/services) and we're [happy to help with any questions](https://iwantmyname.com/support) you may have regarding domains too!
