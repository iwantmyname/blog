It's never good news to hear that prices for anything are going up, but the domain registry [CoCCA](http://cocca.org.nz) has announced that [.CX](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/cx-domain-name-registration-for-christmas-island) and [.TL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tl-domain-name-registration-for-timor-leste) domains will be increasing in price starting January 2014. Adjusted for the new registry price, .CX and .TL domains will now cost:

+ $119 for new registrations
+ $79 for renewals, transfers and restores

To make up for the bad news though, take a look at the greatest spoiler of all time - [Exposing Houdini's Tricks of Magic by R.D. Adams in 1929](http://blog.modernmechanix.com/exposing-houdinis-tricks-of-magic/). It's quite an entertaining read.
