It's always an interesting task to go back and look at your highest performing posts of the year. In just a quick glance, you can see what posts your audience likes to read, what kind of content works best, and even how well different types of headlines perform. 

And because 2014 is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to write up the top posts you all - the readers - have been clicking on.

1. [How To Get A Custom Email Address](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-get-a-custom-email-address.html)
> In short, when you buy a domain through iwantmyname, creating a custom email address is just like creating a website. You have to pick a platform, then install your custom domain to it. For example, if "The Dude"--owner of theinternet.io (likely not the name of the real owner)--wanted to setup a custom email address, he could search through the email hosts in our app marketplace and pick the one that suits him best. Each of them will let him email from thedude@theinternet.com, but each will also provide a slightly different set of features for a range of prices.

2. [4 New Blogging Platforms Launched In 2013](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/06/new-blogging-platforms-that-launched-in-2013-so-far.html)
> Phew, we're almost halfway through 2013 already and there's already been a bunch of crazy stuff happening in the blogging world. Not only has Yahoo! purchased Tumblr, a bunch of new competitors have entered the ring.

3. [.IO Domains Now Even More Awesome For Startups!](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/io-domains-now-more-awesome.html)
> Good news for .io domain lovers: the popular domain for internet startups and personal sites is now seen as a generic country code top-level domain or short "gccTLD" by Google. This means you can target your site at a specific geographical audience such as the USA or UK in Google Webmaster Tools. We've been advocating for this change since last year and are happy the search engine giant finally listened. Thank you for that Google!

4. [Prefer to own your data? Here are some alternatives to Google Analytics](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/prefer-to-own-your-data-here-are-some-alternatives-to-google-analytics.html)
> Google Analytics has become somewhat of the tool of choice for most people who run their own website. After all, it's free, and what's better than free, right? You're always giving something in exchange for Google offering a service for "free" and in this case, that's data on your website. There are some great alternatives out there that many aren't aware of so we've made a short roundup of the ones we liked most.

5. [Express Your Interest In 100+ New Domain Extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/07/express-your-interest-in-100-new-domain-extensions.html)
> With over 250 million domain names currently registered globally, you may be wondering just why there's a need for more internet real estate in the form of newly announced top level domains (TLDs). But let's put that number in perspective. There's already around 2.4 billion internet users now and that number continues to expand rapidly. The cost for individual users to create a personal presence on the web is dropping all the time as the cost of hosting has become a commodity and the quality of online website builder services has improved markedly. So it's a safe bet a lot more people out there will be needing a web address in the future. There's still plenty of room for growth.

6. [100+ Beautifully Designed .IO Domain Websites](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/04/io-domain-website-showcase.html)
> Nice showcase of well-designed websites using the .io top-level domain from Russell Beattie.

7. [The New Domain Extensions (gTLDs) Are Coming](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-new-domain-extensions-gtlds-are-coming.html)
> This is amazing news, as we'll soon be seeing more and more gTLDs (i.e. generic domain extensions like .blog and .music) roll out to the public. You can already subscribe to updates on the above mentioned top-level domains .онлайн, .сайт, .شبكة, .游戏 - we will notify as soon as further information about final launch dates and pricing comes to hand. For a more complete list of the gTLDs coming out, check out theresatldforthat.com.

8. [Getting a new VPS? Do these steps first.](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/03/getting-a-new-vps-do-these-steps-first.html)
> This week, we found a great post by Bryan Kennedy on the things he spends the first five minutes doing on any new Linux server. We won't copy the content, but in essence it's a series of applications and tasks to run that allow you to be a safer system administrator.

9. [The Best Hosting Services For Writers](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/08/the-best-hosting-services-for-writers.html)

10. [Protect Your Domains Using Two-Step Authentication](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/protect-your-domain-registrar-account-with-two-factor-authentication.html)
> We are excited to now offer two-step authentication for all iwantmyname accounts! This adds an extra layer of login protection for your account to prevent third parties from accessing domains and making unauthorized changes to settings such as nameservers or DNS records.
