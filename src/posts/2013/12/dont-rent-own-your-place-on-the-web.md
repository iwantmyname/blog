<!-- excerpt -->

It's an interesting analogy - rent vs. own - one that most people don't think about when they're on the web. Just look at the platforms people are hosting their online identities on today. Facebook and LinkedIn, and even Medium. What would happen if they became completely paid platforms? Or completely fell out of favor? Even if you could export your content out, would you be ok with your identity losing all its SEO? Or losing all those comments and likes that make your online presence seem alive? When you're not the owner of your space, you really have no say.
