<!-- excerpt -->

If you've recently received a domain renewal notice from Domain Registry of America in the mail, please be aware that it's a long-running scam. Domain Registry of America has been in a number of disputes over the past decade for sending what appears to be official renewal statements, but are really misleading mailers forcing responders to pay extremely high domain transfer and renewal fees. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

From the [Better Business Bureau (BBB)](http://www.bbb.org/upstate-new-york/business-reviews/internet-services/domain-registry-of-america-in-buffalo-ny-17000531/):

> The BBB file contains a pattern of complaints from consumers who report that the company's mailing is misleading. Consumers state that they have received notices from Domain Registry of America that appear to be invoices for renewal of their internet domain name. The company claims that their marketing materials clearly state that 'Domain name holders are not obligated to renew their domain name with their current registrar or the Domain Registry of America.... This notice is not a bill.'

Needless to say, Domain Registry of America currently has an F rating based on "252 complaints closed with BBB in (the) last 3 years."

If you see any such mailings, or any communication that seems suspicious or overly "phishy," please [contact our support team](https://iwantmyname.com/support) and we'll verify its legitimacy.
