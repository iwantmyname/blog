<!-- excerpt -->

Recently we uprooted the entire the entire team from Wellington and took up residence for a fortnight on a balmy tropical island not too distant from our shores. Make no mistake it wasn't all beer and skittles, there was plenty of code written, strategising done and overdue admin sorted. It's just a whole lot more fun working by the beach in your shorts with an ice cold pineapple juice near at hand.

It's an outing we repeat on a yearly basis and it's something we unashamedly promote as part of our drive to attract top talent...and yes, we are looking to employ at present! We are [currently seeking a back-end developer](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/job-opening-back-end-blacksmith-developer.html) to support our growth globally and to help keep the iwantmyname engines oiled up and running smoothly.

Perl, Erlang, Coffee Script, Lua, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Redis, Kyoto Tycoon, Puppet, Vagrant are part of our super stack that keep us humming, so you'll need to know about at least some of these or be keen to learn. We also love open source, tech start-ups and amazing design, so if you're strongly community minded and already have some interesting projects in your CV, that gets you extra bonus points.

You could be part of one of the coolest little global tech companies emerging out of New Zealand at present. To get in touch and find out more, fire up a console and do a dig lookup on TXT jobs.iwantmyname.com
