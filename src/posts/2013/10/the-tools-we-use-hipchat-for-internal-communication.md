<!-- excerpt -->

Even when you're a relatively small business with an office in beautiful Wellington, NZ, communication between employees is tough. People go out of town. Decide to all work remotely at 2am. Things happen. So when we need to chat without vocal chords, we use [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/).

<!-- /excerpt --> 

Let's be clear here, HipChat isn't just a rebranded version of AIMâ€”it does some pretty amazing things. For starters, it makes for a great information repository. Grab one person, or set up a "room" for a specific group or team and you can share PDFs, docs and images by just dragging and dropping your files. And when you need to bring in a tweet (something we use quite often), just paste the tweet URL and it shows up like it would in your Twitter client.

And for dev teams, HipChat's integration with Bitbucket, GitHub and a [slew of other tools and apps](http://help.hipchat.com/knowledgebase/topics/10037-integrations) on the web makes it invaluable. I won't go into specific details, but every time just about anything goes wrong, gets changed/updated or completed, it's saved until the end of time on a running HipChat list (did we mention the complete chat history and 256-bit SSL encryption?).

HipChat is also great when you're completely mobile. Using the HipChat app (available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hipchat/id418168984?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipchat&hl=en)), you have all the functionality of the desktop app right in your hands. And with email and mobile push notifications, you'll never miss anything. 

If you're interested in trying a new "chat" tool, you can check out HipChat [free for 30 days](https://www.hipchat.com/pricing), then just $2/user/month after that (it's always free for teams of five and under). We definitely recommend it.
