There's really no way around it anymore (unless you're a mega-company like Apple)—social media is kind of a necessary tool for doing business. It lets you interact with people using your products, and it gives you a pretty huge soapbox to talk to the world. 

But there's an interesting balance you face when mixing general conversations with support questions, important messages and links to posts and new pages. How much is too much? What clicks with your audience? What's the science behind all this madness?

<!-- /excerpt -->

For this, we use [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/). Buffer is a social tool that lets us send messages through all of our social channels ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/iwantmyname), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/112962523733159717427/posts), [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/iwantmyname)) at once. But the magic happens when you start timing posts, then checking post analytics to see how something did. 

Does being funny work? Do people like links from around the internet? Can I get away with posting about my dog (ok, that's never happened)? With Buffer, you can visually see how many retweets and likes you got. Or how many clicks a post got on each platform.

And best of all, Buffer hooks up with a number of third-party platforms to make social even better. For instance, when we post blogs now, Buffer automatically posts them on all our platforms at our next scheduled posting time using Zapier (IFTTT also works). And the link used by Buffer is automatically shortened to [iwnt.my/XXXXXX with our synched-up Bit.ly account](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/the-tools-we-use-bitly-for-link-shortening.html). It's really quite amazing, and the list of [platforms available](https://bufferapp.com/extras) is very impressive. 

So if you're doing social for your brand (or yourself?), give it a shot. We definitely recommend it.

**Extra credit:** In addition to providing this super-handy platform, Buffer also publishes some interesting articles on social analytics. Here's a good one, titled, "[A scientific guide to posting Tweets, Facebook posts, Emails and Blog posts at the best time.](http://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-post-to-facebook-send-emails-publish-blogposts)"
