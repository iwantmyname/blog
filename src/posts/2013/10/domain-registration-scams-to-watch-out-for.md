title: Another Domain Registration Scam To Watch Out For
----

<!-- excerpt -->

Nobody wants to get scammed, but we see it happen to people all the time. And while scamming techniques are constantly becoming more and more sophisticated, you can always protect yourself by being aware of who you're sending money to and what you're paying for. 

Here's a scam we've seen going around recently. It looks pretty real, but the truth is in the details.

###The Email.

The wording here is very tricky, basically telling you that if you don't send money, *their* offer will expire—not your domain, which they're trying to trick you into transferring.

And on a side note, here's the deal with anyone offering search engine submission or search engine optimization (SEO). There's no magic button. No secret guy you can pay off. Most platforms on the web now have some sort of SEO built in, and any sort of real SEO work takes time, relevant content and a plan. 

So before you pay for anything, know what you're getting yourself into. If it sounds like hocus-pocus, it probably is. Do your research.

###The payment page.

If you click through, the payment page is even sneakier than the email. No information, real payment verification logos and a legitimate-looking form asking you for money.

Here's the rule. If you're on a URL other than iwantmyname.com or didn't receive the invoice from an email address ending in '@iwantmyname.com' or '@support.iwantmyname.com', don't trust it. And if you're ever unsure about a payment, just send us a [message](https://iwantmyname.com/support). We're always here to help.
