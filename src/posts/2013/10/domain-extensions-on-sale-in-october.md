Ah October. A month of beautiful weather, toasted pumpkin seeds and scary people dressed up as zombies at the mall. And at iwantmyname, we're kicking it of with some great domain sales the whole family can enjoy (not scary, we promise):

<!-- /excerpt -->

+ [.co @ $15.95 USD][1] — Need to lock-in your .com branding with a .co domain name? Now's the time to make that happen. 
+ [.me @ $19.95 USD][2] — One of our most popular personal blogging domains, .me is the perfect match for your already-in-use @me.com email address.
+ [.io @ $49.00 USD][3] — For startups and tech innovators, we're now in a post-.com world--it's all .io from here.
+ [.sh @ $49.00 USD][4] — Seriously, how many words end in "sh." If you're in the mood for a killer domain hack, .sh has what you're looking for. 
+ [.es @ $14.90 USD][5] — Like .sh, the possibiliti.es for a .es domain hack are endl.es. 

And that's not all! Find even more domain extensions on sale this month on our new [Special Offers][6] page.
