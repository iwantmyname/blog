title: "The Tools We Use: Mou For Writing On The Web"

<!-- excerpt -->

[Markdown][1] is kind of a big deal these days in the web writing world, so naturally, Markdown editors are coming out in droves. Good ones, too. But the Markdown editor I find most appealing for my web copy wasn't even designed for writers. It's [Mou][2], "the missing Markdown editor for web developers."

<!-- /excerpt -->

What I like about Mou is that it provides a live preview of my "code output" in a side-by-side screen display (full-screen writing is available, but I tend to be in the "I'm ok with distractions" camp). Markdown syntax is incredibly easy to write, but it's always nice to know when I forget to end a link with a "]" or a start an H3 header with the right amount of "#"s. And it's especially nice to be able to use Cmd-B for bold and Cmd-I for italics, although I'm sure this is a common feature amongst Markdown editors.

Also, with Mou you can post directly to your Scriptogr.am or Tumblr account with a single command. Very cool if you're into [Dropbox blogging][6] and/or Tumblogging. 

And if you're a developer, it does does so much more. "Syntax highlighting, sync scroll, auto save, powerful actions, auto pair, custom themes and CSS, HTML and PDF export, enhanced CJK support." You can even write in Chinese traditional with a vertical layout. Pretty cool stuff.

Best of all though, you can get Mou right now for free at mouapp.com while it's still in beta (although I wholeheartedly recommend [donating to the cause][3]—I gave $10 last week). If you're into writing in Markdown, give it a shot. I think you'll like it.

###A responsive, web-based alternative: Editorially

One thing I'm also playing around with right now is a responsive, web-based Markdown editor called [Editorially][4], [created by some really smart people][5]. What makes it especially nifty is that it saves each version of your draft for all eternity (and displays them on a simple timeline), then lets you invite others to edit, leave comments and discuss your progress. For long-form copywriters, these collaboration tools are invaluable—but my copy tends to be relatively short.
