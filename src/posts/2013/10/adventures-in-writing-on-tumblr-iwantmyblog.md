Unlike most web platforms that make you post to a traditional desktop CMS, Tumblr gives users a million options on how and where you can write. Ok, maybe a few dozen. But before we get to the wackier methods, let's start with the basics--the desktop Tumblr dashboard.

As I said before, Tumblr isn't your run-of-the-mill blog platform, and posting certainly isn't limited to articles with standard images. Readily available is an option to post text, photos, quotes, links, chats, audio and video, and each option is designed to not promote lengthy writing. Tumblr is for microblogging--sharing small snippets of things you find interesting. 

But who wants to have to go to a website to micropost? From [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/email_publishing):

> Can I post to my blog via email?
>
> Yup! We've made it incredibly easy to post from your desktop or mobile phone. Just send an email with the content you'd like to publish to your blog's custom, randomly generated email address.

Or if you're like me, you can write in Markdown with Mou and send the doc to Tumblr directly. It even inserts a little "!m" to the subject so Tumblr knows it to convert from Markdown before posting.

And if you want to get even more tricky, you can install the [bookmarklet](http://www.tumblr.com/apps), [download the app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404#_=_) or even [phone in audio posts](http://www.tumblr.com/tips) (seriously).
