title: Mad Mimi Means Happy Email Marketing


----

<!-- excerpt -->

Here's the truth. Small businesses and entities around the world waste a gazillion dollars a year paying marketing firms to figure email marketing out for them. And sure, there are plenty of instances where having an email marketing team is useful, but for the vast majority of folks, a platform like [Mad Mimi][1] is all you need.

With Mad Mimi, email marketing is about as simple as it can possibly get. Just start up an email, lay your content into modules and arrange your page to perfection. Instead of getting caught up in rigid themes which quickly become dated, you have full control over what goes where. Throw a banner on top (they'll help you create one) and go full width, tweak a theme to look just how you want it or hire a freelance designer to make you a nice template. It's all super fast and incredibly intuitive. 

But what makes Mad Mimi especially nice is its automated backend—which is robust enough to run a heavyweight campaign. Automatically manage bounces and unsubscribes. Real-time tracking and targeted reporting. SSL data protection. Integration with a huge selection of [third-party platforms][2], interactive lists and forms, and of course, brilliant custom domains (with [one-click setup in our marketplace!][3]).  

And best of all, the Mad Mimi team is full of extremely pleasant people. So if you're looking to start up an email campaign or simply want to test the waters of email marketing, Mad Mimi should definitely be on your radar.
