Home to more than 28 million people, Malaysia is a beautiful coastal country split into two parts by the South China Seaâ€”Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. And amongst its endless white-sand beaches and prehistoric rain forests, there's quite a bit going on.

World-class shopping in Kuala Lumpur (rated CNNGo's fourth best shopping city on the planet). Delicious dining at George Town, Penang. Unbelievable sightseeing on Langkawi Island. And a number of must-see events and celebrations, including Thaipuasam at the Batu Caves, Hari Merdeka and the Formula One Malaysia Grand Prix in Sepang. 

And now you can own a small bit of Malaysia yourself with a [.MY domain name][1], perfect for local businesses, organizations and anyone with a great .MY domain hack up their sleeves (wham.my, anyone?). Get yours today!
