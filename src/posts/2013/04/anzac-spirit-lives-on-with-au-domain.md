New Zealand and Australia have a long tradition of mateship arising from a shared cultural context and solid friendships forged in the fields of past conflicts. Not only do we share a notable military history, but we also have close [business](http://geniusnet.blogtown.co.nz/2013/04/23/queensland-tech-scene/) and political links with our "cousins" across the Tasman Sea. So, after a long wait, it seems appropriate to be launching  some [Australian domain names](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) on [iwantmyname](http://iwantmyname.com.au/) during ANZAC week. 

With well over 2 million .AU domains registered, the Aussie registry has seen phenomenal growth over the previous decade. But unlike most domains, registrants for these domains must provide documentary proof of a right to register. We've had to make a few changes to allow for this in our processes, but are very pleased to finally have some Aussie domains on our menu of over 100 [global domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains). 

At this stage we are accepting [new registrations of .COM.AU](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia), [.NET.AU](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/net.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) and [.ORG.AU](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/org.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) . An Australian Business Number (ABN), Australian Company Number (ACN), Business Registration Number (ABRN) or trademark registration are all acceptable forms of documentation to accompany an Aussie domain registration. Personal domain [.ID.AU](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/id.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) does not require any supporting business documentation. .AU domain names require a minimum two year registration period.

We also have plans to implement .AU [domain name transfers](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/domain-transfer) in the future and we want to add Australian currency to our shopping cart very soon. So throw some prawns on the barbie, grab a cold tinnie and toast ANZAC friendship with a new domain name for your business in Australia.
