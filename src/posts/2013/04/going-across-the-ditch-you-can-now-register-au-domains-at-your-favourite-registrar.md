Being based in New Zealand, it was always on our roadmap to offer the top-level domain (TLD) of our Australian friends. We know that many of you have been waiting for this TLD since a very long time and it's our absolute pleasure to finally be able to announce the addition of the [.COM.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia), .[NET.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia), [.ORG.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/org.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) and [.ID.AU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/id.au-australian-domain-name-registration-for-australia) extensions to our [domain family](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions).

Please note that all .AU domains can only be registered for a minimum term of 2 years. You'll also need one of the following identifiers for .COM.AU, .NET.AU and .ORG.AU domain names:

 - Australian Business Number (ABN)
 - Australian Company Number (ACN)
 - Business Registration Number (RBN)
 - Trademark Number

New .AU domains are available at $24.90/yr ($19.90 for .ID.AU) &mdash; that's just a little over 2 bucks a month! We currently do not support .AU transfers to iwantmyname and hope to bring this functionality to you later this year. So in the meantime, throw some prawns on the barbie, grab a cold tinnie and [celebrate with a new domain name for your online venture in Australia today](https://iwantmyname.com).
