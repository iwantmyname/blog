Nice [showcase of well-designed websites](http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/artisanal-websites-the-rise-of-io-domains-for-well-crafted-web-services) using the [.io top-level domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) from Russell Beattie:

> I made a list of the interesting io sites I found and passed the URLs through a free screenshot app called Paparazzi to create a bunch of thumbnails. I included them below so you could see for yourself what I'm talking about. Sure there are thousands of other sites out there, and plenty of .com's, .me's, .ly's, etc., but have you have seen so many cool sites grouped together like that, all with such clean URLs before? Not a scammy site among them... it's pretty amazing. Check them out yourself.
