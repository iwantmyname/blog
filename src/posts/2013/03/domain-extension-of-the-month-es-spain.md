The Spanish top-level domain (TLD) is a favourite amongst iwantmyname customers. With 1.5 million [.ES domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-spanish-domain-name-registration-for-spain) registered in total, it is not only the preferred suffix in Spain but also internationally with many [domain hacks](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html) floating around the interwebs (even the Spanish registry operator red.es is a domain hack &mdash; redes translated means networks).

If you are doing business in Europe, Spain's domain extension should also be part of your wider brand protection strategy. Unlike other [European countries which require a local address](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/02/need-to-register-domains-requiring-a-postal-address-in-europe-weve-got-you-covered.html), the .ES web address is completely unrestricted.

You can register your .ES domain now for only $12.00 USD throughout March. And if you want to move domains from other registrars, [.ES transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/es-domain-registrar-transfer-spain) are even free of charge.
