Welcome Manuela Vetters to the [iwantmyname family](https://iwantmyname.com/about)! Manu joins us to help with [managing your domain transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/transferservice) and general support enquiries. She brings plenty of domain industry experience to the table, having worked for both the registrar and registry side of things.

We hired Manu because she's got the patience of 100 Zen masters. As you can see, sometimes she can get very ...expressive... without her morning coffee though.
