It's been a long time in the making but we're very proud to introduce [the Canadian top-level domain .CA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-canadian-domain-name-registration-for-canada) at iwantmyname! It is now available for registration at an affordable $19 USD/yr.

You can also [transfer your Canadian domains to iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ca-domain-registrar-transfer-canada). All you need to do is obtain a so-called authorization code from the current registrar (that's a standard procedure), start the .CA transfer process and your domains will be manageable through iwantmyname within a few minutes.

Please note that the registry [CIRA](http://cira.ca) does not allow the use of a local proxy service [like we offer for European TLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/02/need-to-register-domains-requiring-a-postal-address-in-europe-weve-got-you-covered.html). This means only residents or businesses from Canada are allowed to register the .CA domain extension. So, if you are eligible join the more than 2 million .CA domain owners and [start your domain search today](https://iwantmyname.com)!
