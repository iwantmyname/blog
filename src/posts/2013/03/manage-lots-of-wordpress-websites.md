If you're having [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) websites left, right and center, then you're probably suffering from the same headache as most power users. Every time you log in to another site there's something needing to be updated or maintained. It feels like you're endlessly updating WordPress and while it's not a bad thing to have updates, there's a better way to do that. Enter [ManageWP](https://managewp.com/).

A real solution to a WordPress administrator's headache &mdash; it allows you to manage as many WordPress websites as one can handle from a single dashboard. You can update all your blogs' plugins in one hit or take backups quick and easily.

Additionally, ManageWP makes it simple to actually migrate WordPress to a new [web host](https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting). Everyone's probably done this at least once if they own a WordPress blog and the migration path for WordPress is not the friendliest. ManageWP makes it dead simple &mdash; you just add the old website in, then you set up a blank WordPress installation on the destination and use ManageWP to clone it. Nothing else required. The first time I did one of those migrations I thought it wouldn't have covered off everything, but everything was there.

Backups are another nightmare you face all the time &mdash; ManageWP allows you to actually back up directly to third party services such as Dropbox, Amazon S3 and Google Drive. It zips up the entire website and drops it in there easy.

We'd encourage you to check this tool out when you get a chance, it can make your life easier and allows you to get on to the important stuff &mdash; posting blogs! [ManageWP](https://managewp.com/) is free for up to five sites in the basic form but is just $0.80 per website, making it killer (especially if it saves you from a complete site failure).
