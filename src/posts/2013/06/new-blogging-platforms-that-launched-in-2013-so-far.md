title: 4 new blogging platforms launched in 2013


----

Phew, we're almost halfway through 2013 already and there's already been a bunch of crazy stuff happening in the blogging world. Not only has [Yahoo! purchased Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/05/worried-about-your-tumblr-blog-after-the-acquisition-by-yahoo.html), a bunch of new competitors have entered the ring. 


### Posthaven

We've written about Posthaven and their awesome promise of lifetime hosting before and we still love them. Posthaven rose from the ashes of Posterous to save blogs from the old platform that was sold but also accepts new blogs now and is still rolling out new features.

If you're looking for a trustworthy platform that's going to last for a long time, we recommend you [use these guys with your domain](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/posthaven-custom-domain).


### Postachio

Want something stupidly simple? Meet Postach.io. It's simple, it's easy and it's gorgeous. Even better? It just builds on top of your Evernote notes.

All you need to do is create a notebook [add your domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postachio). Then tag the note in Evernote as "published" and they'll be flicked onto your blog. The idea of a blog that you don't have to host it yourself and you still own your data sounds awesome to us!


### Postagon

Calling all minimalists! This one's for you! Postagon is a free blogging service that brags that they're the choice for those who want to have a clean and simple platform. Simpler interfaces are gaining a lot of popularity!

Check out the [demo blog](http://demo.postagon.com/) to be amazed; the way that it's laid out and is simply _readable_ is awesome. Whilst the service has a quite limited feature set, simplicity can sometimes be a virtue: there's no theming at all (to keep the experience clean), no plugins, widgets or tags and... no social boxes. It's just [blogging on your own domain](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/postagon-custom-domain), plain and simple.


### Ghost

In one of the biggest runaway successes on Kickstarter this year, Ghost is an up and coming sensation. Intended as "just a blogging platform" rather than Wordpress' "we do everything" strategy, Ghost hopes to take the blogging world by storm with beautiful design and simply interfaces.

The platform promises to focus on content and making people _want _to use the writing platform. The Kickstarter asked for £25,000 to build it, but ended up with an incredible total of £196,362. It's simple, it's beautiful and like nothing else that's available right now. Ghost is currently being built by the team that was successfully funded and should be available for use later on this year. Not only will it be free, it'll be open source too and will be simple to port existing Wordpress themes to. Colour us excited!
