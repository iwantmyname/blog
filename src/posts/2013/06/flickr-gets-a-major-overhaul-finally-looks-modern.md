title: Flickr Gets A Major Overhaul, Finally Looks Modern
----

Yahoo! had neglected Flickr essentially ever since they purchased the website back in 2005, but a few days ago they unveiled perhaps [the largest overhaul](http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/50934634700/your-world-in-full-resolution) the photo sharing site has ever seen.

Not only has the site been radically changed to make the most of the usable space on a screen, it's also fully mobile compatible and now has proper mobile applications for Android and iPhone. Even better? The company is offering a terabyte of free storage to all users.

As part of the changes, this means pro accounts have been discontinued. The only paid offerings now offer the option of doubling storage to two terabytes for $499.99 / yr or to remove advertising for $50 / yr.

It's definitely the best way to back up your photos for free we've ever seen, so we totally recommend jumping onboard and taking advantage of the space. If you have a [Wordpress blog](https://iwantmyname.com/services/open-source/) or [website builder](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/), there are a bunch of great plugins for displaying your photos on the site too, like [this one](http://wordpress.org/plugins/flickr-photostream/). It's a great way to avoid having to host the photos yourself!

Flickr getting an overhaul like this is pretty surprising for a company like Yahoo! -- let's hope this is the start of a new trend -- perhaps they're on the track to becoming cool again?
