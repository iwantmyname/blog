Almost 20 years after founding the European Union, one would think that it may also have had a profound impact on the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) of its member states -- but the reality is looking somewhat different. In 2013 there are still quite a few restricted European top-level domains (TLDs) which require a local presence in the respective country.

Luckily, you can buy some of these TLDs without an address in Germany, France, Italy or other countries in Europe. If you purchase one of the following domain extensions at iwantmyname, we can help you out with a local proxy service:

- [France](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fr-french-domain-name-registration-for-france): the French top-level domain requires a physical address in France which is added to all .fr domains purchased at iwantmyname automatically and included in our yearly registration fee. This also applies to the affiliated .re, .pm, .tf, .wf and .yt suffixes of French dependencies or overseas territories.

- [Germany](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany): our trustee service for .DE domains is available at $5/year and will be added to your order if required. It will replace your international address with the mandatory German admin contact address.

- [Italy](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/it-italian-domain-name-registration-for-italy): the Italian TLD needs a street address in one of the European member states. Our .it proxy service provides this address for domains ordered through our service at no additional cost.

- [Europe](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe): all .EU domains must be registered using a residential address in one of its member states. Should you not reside in the European Union, we provide a trustee service at $12/year and apply it to your order automatically.

As you can see, we are making it dead-easy to register international domains for you. [Get started with your domain search now](https://iwantmyname.com).
