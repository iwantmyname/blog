[Wellington Startup Weekend](http://wellington.startupweekend.org/) kicks off the 2013 round of New Zealand events at a fantastic venue in the newly opened [College of Creative Arts building](http://archived.link/http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/colleges/college-creative-arts/about/events/new-college-building-progress/new-college-of-creative-arts-building.cfm) on the Massey University campus. Of course iwantmyname is continuing to support Startup Weekend, as the initiative continues to grow in New Zealand. 

This weekend's event differs slightly in that it begins on Saturday evening 16th February, in order to dovetail nicely with world class design fest Webstock. So it will be our pleasure to shout a few drinks at the event launch as well as offer each team a free .com, .net, .org, or .nz [domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) for their project if needed. Some of the [iwantmyname team](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/about) will also be on hand to help out with mentoring throughout the weekend.

[iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/) has a large following amongst the design community because we make it one-click easy to [domain customise design blogs](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/) and portfolio sites when you choose a hosted service from our [app marketplace](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services). Appropriately, we are also sponsoring a design student to participate in Wellington Startup Weekend. Imagine adding a new start-up venture to your [design portfolio](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/portfolio-hosting/) right at the start of the year! 

**UPDATE** - We have a winner! Massey 4th year design student **Victoria Kershaw** will be winging her way to Wellington Startup Weekend courtesy of iwantmyname. We think she will bring a fantastic set of skills to the event.
