*(As you can see, Kevin is enjoying the beaches in New Zealand)*

Not only is our [domain family](https://iwantmyname.com/domains) constantly growing, but also the iwantmyname family. We're happy to announce the newest addition to our [team](https://iwantmyname.com/about), [Kevin Ingersoll](https://twitter.com/kingersoll), who is a self-proclaimed geek with dreads, domainer, EDM junkie, gamer, disc golfer, bowler, and aspiring DJ and cyclist. Whoa!

He's joining us as a front-end developer to help with the launch of our new dashboard ([interested in early access?](https://docs.google.com/a/ideegeo.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dFNTLWlaZ0ZmTW1HYnZaVGZlZGpmYWc6MQ)). Kevin will also make sure to improve our system for larger account holders so he can quickly transfer his 750 domains from other registrars to iwantmyname... ;)
