The beautiful text editing app for Mac, iPhone and iPad that is designed to make writing more enjoyable and productive has received a pretty large update recently.

Thats right, [Byword 2.0](http://bywordapp.com/) has been released and it brings in tow a majorly awesome new feature. The ability to directly publish to blogs. With the click of a button (and a small, one time purchase in-app) you'll be able to publish to [Blogger](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/blogger-blogspot-free-blog-with-own-url), [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url), [Scriptogram](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/scriptogr.am-custom-domain) and [Evernote](http://evernote.com).

If you haven't heard of Byword, it's easily the best writing application out there for those that live in the Apple ecosystem. It's beautifully simplistic and uses Markdown to format your writing, a format which I'm already hopelessly addicted to.

Not only does Byword let you publish directly to your blog, you can export the document into a PDF, RTF, HTML or LaTeX document easily. If you're not using Byword already, it's time to [jump onboard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)!
