The hardest part of my startup journey has not been coming up with the idea, finding co-founders or testing the idea on end-users. The slowest and most frustrating part so far has been simply choosing a business name and subsequently a domain name that I'm prepared to stick with. 

Partly this is due to the evolving nature of what the business is/will be. A larger part of it is purely my indecision and the feeling that getting the name wrong will ultimately be the difference between massive success and catastrophic failure. This will almost certainly not be the case. Plenty of businesses have turned obscure or peculiar domains into household names and others have failed in spite of excellent branding and domains that scream success.

Coming up with a name that not only relates well to the business concept but is memorable, snappy, fun (but not silly), serious (but not boring) and most of all available has become a farcically long process and I'm beginning to see why consultants are paid substantial amounts of money to do just that. 

A quick look through my notebooks and iwantmyname dashboard reveals a bewildering history of domain options, each with its own merit, none considered ultimately good enough. They range from my early .co.nz versions (easily obtainable but not suitably international) to self explanatory, www.getitinwriting.com (too long, plus it has tit in it) to "Take a word and stick an animal on the end" a la SurveyMonkey and MailChimp. 

Along the way I've tried anagram generators, backwards words, made up words and combination words. I've considered various suffixes, different languages and alternative spellings. I've asked my co-founders for ideas, my potential customers for feedback and my 6 year old niece for inspiration. 

I've become frustrated at people who register and hoard good domain names and realised my hypocrisy when I look at the domains I've registered and will probably never use. I've lamented the fact that all the good names are taken and 
then been reminded that while 252 million of them have gone, there are a hundred thousand or so new ones added every day. 

So I'm not giving up, and here are the best bits of advice I've been given:

1. Don't worry about it, concentrate on creating an awesome business, website or blog. If you are successful, your weird domain name might become your biggest asset.
2. People click on links more than they type in whole website addresses. If you build something worth finding, they'll find you.
3. Open your mind, make up a list of the potentials and get your colleagues and customers to rate them.
4. By all means be random and obscure, but consider pronunciation and make sure you're not accidentally including foreign swear words.
5. If in doubt, stick an animal on the end.

As for me, have I settled on a domain for my amazing, game changing new online startup? Ask me next week.
