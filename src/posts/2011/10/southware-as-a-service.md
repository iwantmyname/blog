This month's featured website is [Codecraft](http://codecraft.org.nz/), a group that has become a focus point for happenings in the software innovation scene around Dunedin. Codecraft is part of an active information technology [community](http://archived.link/http://codecraft.org.nz/?q=node/8) in the region and is based at Otago University's [Centre for Innovation](http://www.otago.ac.nz/centreforinnovation/).

The group promotes "software craftmanship" as an underlying philosophy, invoking a sense of community and professionalism amongst members in their efforts to develop well crafted software. To support this approach Codecraft offers regular technical seminars for [developers](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/developer/), the details of which are posted on the website. Codecraft also encourages mentor-student relationships and works with other groups in the local software industry.

Codecraft has connections with The Distiller an initiative that coaches [newly launched](http://archived.link/http://www.thedistiller.org/startups) technology start-up businesses and which has recently extended its influence to Auckland. One of the earliest ventures to emerge from The Distiller was Pocketsmith a successful web based [personal finance and budgeting](http://www.pocketsmith.com/) app that has achieved some very positive [reviews](http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/start-saving-pocketsmith-is-a-crystal-ball-for-your-bank-accounts/). Francois Bondiguel, a co-founder of Pocketsmith and omnipresent tech networker is a big fan of growing more software companies. It certainly shows with the contribution he and the team have made. The Deep South not only has outstanding wildlife, but also a vibrant [software start-up](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/09/iwantmyname-backs-startup-weekend.html) and innovation community.
