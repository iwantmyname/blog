[youMust.me](http://archived.link/http://youmust.me) from 18-year old [Zack Fernandez](https://twitter.com/#!/zackfern) is a simple tool to get all sorts of recommendations by sharing a personal URL with your friends. Zack was inspired by the recent success of [threewords.me](http://threewords.me) so he decided to launch his own project. He [registered the domain](https://iwantmyname.com), created the site and tied everything together using our [simplified Heroku DNS setup](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain).

Here's how youMust.me works:

1. Share your personal URL youmust.me/yourusername with your friends and ask them what you must "do", "hear", "read" or "see".

   ![youmust2.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2011-01-27-youmust2.png)

2. Get the results on your personal youMust.me homepage:

   ![youmust1.png]({{ site.images_url }}/2011-01-27-youmust1.png)

Congrats to Zack for launching his site! Want to have your domain featured on our blog? Send me an email to [timo@iwantmyname.com](mailto:timo@iwantmyname.com).
