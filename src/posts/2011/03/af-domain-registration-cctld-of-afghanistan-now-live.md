We've just enabled domain registration for [.AF domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/af-afghan-domain-name-registration-for-afghanistan), the Afghan ccTLD (country code top-level domain). The .AF TLD can be registered by anybody worldwide. It also supports [2-letter domain registration](https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search) for short domains and a popular choice for [domain hacks](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2009/05/how-to-find-a-domain-hack.html). Our domain pricing for the .AF web address is $125 USD for new registrations and renewals.

Purchase your own .AF domain for your [website](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/), [personalized email address](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/) or [URL shortener](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/) today!
