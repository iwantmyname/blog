At iWantMyName we make it really easy to personalise your web profile service with a domain of your choice. A number of the big social networking sites don't allow this, so where do you go if you want a profile site that reflects your personality? We've dug up some [cool web profile services](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) that we think you'll love. 

First up we are big [Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url) fans and have to say it makes a great profile service as well as a blogging site. It's really easy to tailor your Tumblr site with nice images or backgrounds and posting is a breeze too. [Flavors.me](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/customize-flavors.me-website-with-your-own-domain) is also a great way to go, but differs in that it aggregates all your content in one place. Flavors.me is especially handy if you have a [creative business](http://flavors.me/jboydphoto) and want to show off your talents.

A personal domain [anchors and protects](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2010/11/anchor-your-social-media-presence-with-a-domain.html) your presence online and best of all its portable. There's a bunch of other services on our [profile services page](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) that you can have fun exploring as well.
