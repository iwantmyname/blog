Rand Fishkin of [SEOmoz](http://seomoz.org/) fame hits the nail on the head with [his answer](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/answers-to-4-excellent-seo-questions) to the following Tweet: "if he could have just one: site or social media presence. Which one would he choose and why!"

[![Twitter Question Own Site Or Social Media Presence]({{ site.images_url }}/2011-06-29-seoquestion1.gif)](https://twitter.com/#!/pedrodias/status/82902994831687680)

Rand's excellent answer:

> I'd always bias to taking the website over the social media presence. It's not that a great Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare or LinkedIn account aren't great, it's just that the flexibility, power, branding and measurability of a website has yet to be matched on any platform. With a website, you can custom build virtually any form of analytics, leverage any type of web technology to display/deliver content and control your own destiny. Even if Facebook or some other new, wholly flexible platform allowed for all of these features, you would still never truly own your home on the web.
>
> I'm a huge supporter of and advocate for social media marketing, but I don't think I could ever endorse having your primary base of marketing and acquisition happen anywhere but on a site you fully own and control.
>
> And that is exactly why should have [your own domain name](https://iwantmyname.com) which easily allows you to [switch services](https://iwantmyname.com/services) at any time.
