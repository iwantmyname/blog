There's been a lot of [buzz](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/12/07/flipboard-comes-to-the-iphone-and-you-can-download-it-now/) around this week about the new [Flipboard](http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8) offering.The technology editor at UK's [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-app-reviews/8941206/Flipboard-for-iPhone-review.html) calls it "one of the essential iPad Apps". So with the iPhone version now launched, its quite likely to gather a huge following. But does Flipboard have universal appeal?

Flipboard is a "social magazine" iOS app that aggregates leading website and social media content. There's no denying that Flipboard has a gorgeous look and feel on the iPad. But personally I find Flipboard's magazine style layout a little random, making it less interesting for me. Maybe it's just how my brain works, but I tend to follow specific verticals rather than put my faith in variety. If I was on a long flight, I'd read Wired and Nat. Geo. from cover to cover, because that's what interests me. If I'm playing online, I want to thoroughly check out my [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/#%21/iWantMyNameNZ) and the latest [Read Write Web](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/flipboard_iphone_app.php) articles directly without the temptation to well...flip.

There's no question that content based apps are now leading the charge in the media wars and [hosted apps for business](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) continue to gain traction globally as well. That's why more and more media organisations are pushing their own apps out into the wild. It's also why we launched our [domain registrar iPhone App](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/iphone) very early on. Do we need a single point of reference for all this content? Clearly, some think so, but I guess it's no coincidence that many of the news organisations that have been raving about Flipboard are also signed up as content partners. Flipboard was not the first magazine app of course, there have been [others](http://blog.appboy.com/2011/02/is-flyscreen-for-iphone-the-flipboard-we-never-got/). But Flipboard has certainly had the most success in building out its partner relationships.

I think Flipboard will probably grow on me over time the more I experiment with it. Have you downloaded the Flipboard iPhone App yet? What has your experience been like?
