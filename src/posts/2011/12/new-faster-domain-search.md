We're excited to release a [new version of the iWantMyName domain search](https://iwantmyname.com/nsearch) today. During 2011 we've been paying a lot of attention to all the great feedback we've been getting from you about our service. Over the last few weeks we've worked really hard to implement some new ideas on the site that we think you'll love.

With almost 100 different domain extensions on offer, the main focus has been on improving speed and more efficiently displaying the search results on a single page. We've also added several different optional display filters such as categories and domain availability:

It's now also easier to search for [two-letter domain names](https://iwantmyname.com/short-domain-search) as we will only show TLDs supporting these little goodies.

The [new search](https://iwantmyname.com/nsearch) currently runs in public beta mode, so please let us know if you run into any issues [via our support center](https://iwantmyname.com/support). We're looking forward to your feedback!
