It's Election 2011 weekend in New Zealand and almost anything could happen. Until the "tea-pot tapes" [debacle](http://www.3news.co.nz/Teapot-tapes-raise-questions/tabid/370/articleID/232724/Default.aspx), many pundits were resoundingly predicting no change of government. But as they say, "a week is a long time in politics". Last minute resurgences by the minor parties have thrown the cat amongst the pigeons, with political [blogs](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/) running hot with commentary.

Kiwis have been using a mixed member proportional voting system (MMP) since 1996, but the current government agreed to deliver a referendum this year to allow voters an opportunity to express their satisfaction (or otherwise) with the current system. MMP is very similar to the way our friends in the [domain of Germany](http://meinname.com/) vote and, whilst not without its faults, has provided relatively stable coalition style governments that build consensus with input from a diversity of political viewpoints. Even if there is a vote for change, it will be 2017 before a different voting system would be implemented.

Saturday evening should be entertaining as the results are announced. In particular we will be hoping to see good returns for those parties that prioritise environmental issues and are promoting more investment in research, science and technology as an economic growth platform. But whatever your political hue, as a [community-minded](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/10/being-good-neighbours.html) company, we think the most important thing is to get out there and exercise your democratic right on the day. Remember there are many less fortunate societies that do not provide such an option to their people.
