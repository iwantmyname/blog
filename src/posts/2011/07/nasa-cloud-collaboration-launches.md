With the final space shuttle mission completed, one could be forgiven for thinking NASA might be looking around for a new line of business altogether - but it's not. In a collaboration with rock star hosting provider Rackspace, the American space explorer is launching into the cloud, to underpin its core business.

In a surprising move NASA and Rackspace have been working together for [over a year](http://archived.link/http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2011/07/19/what-a-year%C2%A0-openstack-at-one/) on a project called Open Stack that utilises software from both organisations. The [open source](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/open-source/)  infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform technology will be made available through an Apache 2.0 license. Rackspace staff have been providing project governance, but the company anticipates other development leaders will come on board as the initiative evolves.

[Open Stack](http://www.openstack.org/) is pitched firmly at other governmental agencies who will be comforted no doubt by the participation of one of the world's leading edge, publicly funded technology providers. [Rackspace announced](http://archived.link/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/072111-rackspace-cloud-openstack.html)recently that it will deploy Open Stack across its own infrastructure. It's a cost effective win-win for NASA as well who expect to generate some useful crowd-sourced code development in return. With its sights firmly set on Mars and other [celestial domains](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory), NASA will be needing a very robust computing platform to take the business of space exploration into the future.
