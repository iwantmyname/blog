Hugely successful media, travel and entertainment group Virgin operates literally [dozens of companies](http://www.virgin.com/company/), but obviously there can only be one Virgin. So how did the they solve the problem of finding unique domain names for the multitude of businesses and markets the company was engaged in?

With .COM continuing to be the most popular domain extension and offering the quickest way to generate website traffic, it is becoming more and more difficult to secure unique domains that fully represent a business brand. When Virgin took up the challenge of building an airline in Australia they sought out a brand name that both reflected company heritage and meant something to parochial Australians - [Virgin Blue](http://www.virginblue.com/). 

Then Virgin decided to launch subsidiary [Pacific Blue](http://archived.link/http://flypacificblue.com/) to offer services around New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Unfortunately at that time Pacific Blue also happened to be the name of a popular American television soap opera. But by adding the word "fly" to their domain, Virgin created a unique web branding tool that didn't conflict. Another technique used by the airline's marketers involves securing related domains and making sure they also point to the Pacific Blue site, for example pacificblueairlines.com

The point is that you can still secure a great domain for your business, with a little extra creativity.
