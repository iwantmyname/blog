Today we're pleased to announce the release of our [managed DNS hosting](https://iwantmyname.com/dns) for domains which are not registered at iWantMyName. This enables you to manage domain names independently from any registrar or registry and also benefit from easy domain customization through the [iWantMyName marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services).

By purchasing the DNS hosting add-on, you will be able to set A, CNAME, MX, AAAA, SRV, TXT, NAPTR record types in real-time and use our URL forwarding services. We also show you additional domain information such as your current registrar, ownership details and expiration dates:

Getting started is easy. Simply purchase the DNS hosting add-on ($2.90/yr) for the domain you would like to manage via your iWantMyName dashboard, apply the desired DNS or URL forwarding settings and switch the nameservers to ns1/2/3/4.iwantmyname.net at your current registrar.
