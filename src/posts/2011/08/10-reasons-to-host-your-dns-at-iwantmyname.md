title: 10 Good Reasons To Host Your DNS With iWantMyName

categories:

---

Now that you can [manage your DNS at iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/dns), here are some use cases for this new feature.

Use our managed DNS hosting when:

1. Your current registrar does not include DNS management with your domain and you have to get it as an expensive add-on service.
2. You would have to buy another add-on for URL forwarding.
3. You've registered a domain with your web host and they only allow full DNS access if you have a hosting package with them. 
4. You do not have the ability to add advanced record types such as TXT, SRV, AAAA or NAPTR. 
5. You have an exotic domain that can only be registered at the registry directly, e.g. [.NR (Nauru)](http://www.cenpac.net.nr/dns/) or [.AS (American Samoa)](http://www.nic.as/).
6. You would like to manage the DNS for domains which are not supported by us yet (we're constantly working on adding more extensions).
7. You want easy domain setup for 70+ hosted services &mdash; we make [DNS simple](https://iwantmyname.com/dns).
8. You are planning to [transfer a domain to iWantMyName](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) at a later stage.
9. You prefer to have all your domains listed in one [management dashboard](https://iwantmyname.com/signin).
10. You are sick of the slow, cluttered and old-fashioned interface of your existing DNS host.
