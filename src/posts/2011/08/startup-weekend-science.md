Test tube experiment. Assemble 300 keen young entrepreneurs in the same town as a world famous [tech conference](http://www.demo.com/), invite one of Silicon Valley's leading identities to speak and stir vigorously. Sounds like a recipe for success!

[Startup Weekend Mega](http://mega.startupweekend.org/) will be the biggest (and coolest) Startup Weekend ever, so we are thrilled to be supporting the event. iWantMyName has been selected as the official supplier of domain names to all of the teams that go forward from the pitching session. That means we will be online throughout the event supporting our offer of a free year's domain name registration of a .COM, .NET, .ORG or .ME domain to each team. We will also offer some discounts on the less common species of domains. But you have to be [registered](http://mega.startupweekend.org/tickets/) at SW Mega, to take advantage of this offer.

The [iWantMyName team](https://iwantmyname.com/about) know all about the challenges of building and growing a new tech venture. So we offer a whole bunch of [hosted services](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/06/14-new-hosting-services-applications-for-your-domains.html) in our app marketplace specifically aimed at assisting developers getting new ventures up and running; including easy [one-click DNS set-up on your domain](https://iwantmyname.com/services). Even if you already have a registrar, you can still use our nifty [DNS management](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/08/introducing-dns-hosting-for-external-domains.html) service across your domain portfolio.

Startup Weekend is a global phenomenon that invites entrepreneurial developers, designers and business heads to form teams, build a product and launch it in the space of a weekend. SW Mega is focusing this time on health, education and gaming - with the category winners earning an amazing opportunity to pitch at DEMO conference later in the week.
