Your customers have a vision that's uniquely theirs.  Your goal as a product or service provider is to fulfill that dream by getting out of the way and making it easier to achieve than your competition. 

I have a 18 month old son and one of my recent dreams involved teaching him to hit a ball off of a tee.  My wife told me I was crazy and that he wouldn't be able to grasp the concept.  Then the first couple of tee-ball sets I saw said "Ages 3+".  The result was that my dream was squashed and I didn't buy anything.  

Then I found a tee-ball set that put the age at "18 months + ".  My dream was alive and I bought it right away. Sure enough, after an hour of practice my son can put the ball on the tee, grab the bat with two hands, and hit home runs over the couch.  Dream realized... happy customer. :)

At KickoffLabs we first based our pricing around the number of customer sign-ups on your landing page.  Even paid accounts were limited to tracking X number of customer signups and emailed newsletters.  But no matter how high we put that number people told us "I'll have more than 100,000 customers quickly... what then?".  

Rationally I knew how hard it would be for ANYONE with a new/small business using our product to hit that kind of number.  But we were killing our customers dreams and that made them less likely to buy our product.  So we changed our pricing model to support unlimited customers so we weren't squashing our customers dreams.  

I'd recommend going through your customer experience today and ask yourself... am I killing a dream? One better... ask your customers what they are dreaming about.
