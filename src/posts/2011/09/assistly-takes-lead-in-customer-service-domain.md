Just like the Remington shaver man, high flying hosted enterprise software provider Salesforce.com loved [Assistly](http://www.assistly.com/) so much that they acquired the company. It's no surprise really. Assistly hits the sweet spot for small businesses using social software for customer support and looks set to take off.

We like Assistly too and recently integrated it into our technical support infrastructure which also includes [Olark](http://olark.com), a cool live chat service. Offering friendly, rapid and engaging customer service is a non-negotiable item for the iWantMyName team, so we appreciate the way Assistly helps us record, track and action customer enquiries from our various [customer support](https://iwantmyname.com/support) channels and social feeds. In fact we also offer easy one-click DNS set-up on your domain through our app marketplace; so you too can [use Assistly for your own business](https://iwantmyname.com/services/helpdesk/custom-domain-assistly).

We also recommend a number of [hosted business services](https://iwantmyname.com/services/business/) that can be domain customized and implemented within minutes. For example, [Shopify](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software) is a great e-commerce platform that gets online micro businesses up and running at very low cost. Naturally you'll also be needing [Google Apps](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/google-apps-for-your-domain) a nifty hosted office toolkit providing secure webmail, document sharing and a handy e-calendar. Want to create your own simple website to showcase your business? There's no shortage of easy [website builders](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/) to get you started.

It's never been easier or cheaper to set up and operate your own web enabled, domain customized business.
