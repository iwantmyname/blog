We've added some oom.ph to our extensive list of almost 100 unique Internet [domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) by adding .PH the [Philippines domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ph-filipino-domain-name-registration-for-philippines). So now's a great time to dream up some crazy domain hacks or perhaps a few [scientific domain names](https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=acidic.ph).

The Republic of the Philippines is a populous Southeast Asian island nation with an interesting political history. Occupied at various times by Spanish, American and Japanese, The Philippines lies in the warm waters of the Western Pacific Ocean and is subject to one or two severe tropical storms each year. The forested archipelago contains a rich array of flora and fauna, although logging and other activities have placed severe pressures on its biodiversity. There are a number of active volcanoes and in 1991 one of the largest eruptions in recorded history took place at Mount Pinatubo, less than 100km from the capital city Manila.

After a period of political upheaval and economic stagnation during the latter half of the 20th Century, The Philippines has shown signs of an economic rebound in the last decade. There are an estimated 10 million Filipinos working offshore who support families at home and an increasingly sophisticated manufacturing and service sector that leverages strong business relationships with nearby neighbours China, Hong Kong and Singpore and with its former colonist United States.

The Philippines domain is managed by [dotPH](http://archived.link/http://dotph.domains.ph/about-dotph/) which had its orgins in a company formed in 1994. The domain registry has had a fully automated management system in place since 1999 and was one of the earliest to implement a shared registry system to streamline transactions with global registrars. Anyone may register a [.PH domain](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ph-filipino-domain-name-registration-for-philippines), although government domains, such as for education and military use, are restricted.
