You can now [buy the .LV domain suffix](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lv-latvian-domain-name-registration-for-latvia) from the Republic of Latvia. After [.LT (Lithuania)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/lt-lithuanian-domain-name-registration-for-lithuania), it is the second TLD from the Baltic region in our growing [list of domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions) at iWantMyName.

Latvia is bordered by Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus and the Russian Federation. With a total population of 2.2 million people, it counts to the smallest member states of the [European Union](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/eu-european-domain-name-registration-for-europe).

While .LV domains are mainly used in the country, registration is unrestricted for companies, organizations and individuals worldwide. This makes .LV an attractive TLD for URL shorteners or vanity URLs, e.g. from Las Vegas.
