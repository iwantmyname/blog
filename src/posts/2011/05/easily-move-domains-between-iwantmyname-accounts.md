title: Easily Move Domains Between iWantMyName Accounts

categories:
  - Domain transfer

After last week's announcement of some [newly transferable domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/05/free-domain-transfer-uk-nz-io-domains.html), it is now also possible to move domains within iWantMyName from one customer to another. This is especially helpful if you want to separate domain management for clients or if you have sold a web address to someone else.

To internally move a domain, the new account holder simply can use our [regular website transfer procedure](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer). All that is needed to start the process is the authorization code from the current owner which can be found on the domain status page in the [iWantMyName dashboard](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard). Internal transfers are processed in real-time meaning the new owner has immediate access to all domain settings. Now that's easy!
