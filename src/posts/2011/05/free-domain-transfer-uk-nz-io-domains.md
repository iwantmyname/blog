We're happy to announce that you can now [transfer](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) a whole bunch of new country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) to iWantMyName. Most importantly,  [.UK transfers](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co.uk-domain-registrar-transfer-united-kingdom) &mdash; often requested by our friends in the United Kingdom &mdash; and other European suffixes.

These domains are newly transferable:
