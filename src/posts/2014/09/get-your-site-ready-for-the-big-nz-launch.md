Our US customers might have a hard time wrapping their heads around this, but local websites in much of the world end with something like thisâ€”.CO.NZ. But the days of ".CO" littering otherwise clean domains seems to be coming to an end. The United Kingdom recently opened up their [.UK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/uk-domain-name-registration-for-united-kingdom) second-level domains, and New Zealand is now following suit.

Starting 30 September at 1pm NZDT, .NZ will be available to everyone on a first come, first served basis ([pre-registration](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) is still open!). But current owners of .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ and .NET.NZ websites will have the ability to reserve their corresponding .NZ domain names for a limited time. Here are the rules.

<!-- /excerpt -->

##How to get your corresponding .NZ domain name

First, [check your "right of registration status"](http://anyname.nz/index.html) which can be one of the following:

+ Preferential Registration or Reservation (PRR) --  these are names that you are entitled to [register](http://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) before anyone else.
+ Conflicted -- existing names that have more than one domain owner entitled to register them (like if different people owned website.CO.NZ and website.NET.NZ). These conflicted domains can be resolved at [anyname.nz](http://anyname.nz/).
+ Available to anyone -- domains that were registered after Feb 11, 2014 are available to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis. We recommend [placing a pre-order for such .nz domains](http://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) to be first in line.

Optionally, you can reserve your corresponding domain for up to two years without purchasing it through [anyname.nz](http://anyname.nz/) (not affiliated with iwantmyname). You must do this before 30 March 2015 though, so if this is the path you want to take, don't let it slip by.

This is a big deal for the world of New Zealand websites, so if you have any questions about the launch or your specific domain's status, please [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
