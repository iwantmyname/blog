title: "Next week, today: So many new domain extensions"

---

<!-- excerpt -->

We've been launching a handful of [new generic top-level domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (gTLDs) each week for quite a while now, but never have we seen a launch so loaded as next weeks. 15 (?!) new gTLDs are launching between September 15-17, and this calls for some kind of pre-week announcement. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

So here's the list:

###September 15

+ [.cooking](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cooking)
+ [.country](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-country)
+ [.fishing](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-fishing)
+ [.horse](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-horse)
+ [.republican](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-republican)
+ [.rodeo](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-rodeo)
+ [.vegas](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vegas)
+ [.vodka](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vodka)

###September 17

+ [.church](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-church)
+ [.guide](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guide)
+ [.host](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-host)
+ [.life](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-life)
+ [.loans](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-loans)
+ [.press](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-press)
+ [.website](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-website)

We've already received a good amount of pre-orders for next week's batch (with an interesting duo, .church and .vegas, taking the lead), but if you have a domain in mind, be sure to pre-order it though the individual TLD pages listed above.
