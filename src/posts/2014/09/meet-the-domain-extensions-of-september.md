<!-- excerpt -->

The world of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) is looking up in September, with a great collection of locations, professions and industries being represented. For starters, we have .london, ,yokohama, .vegas and .bayern launching, as well as .nz, New Zealand's newly opened second-level domain (not a gTLD, but still a very exciting September launch). Some other big expected TLDs are .digital, .guide, .life and .direct—all are fairly short, and have a wide range of uses for various industries. 

Perhaps the tastiest gTLD of the month is .beer. We have an amazing craft-beer scene here in Wellington, and we'd love to see the industry adopt a domain extension with a little character. Our expectations are dampened a bit by the soft launch of .coffee (only 6,858 domains registered worldwide according to [Domain Incite Pro](http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/)), but maybe a more global beer scene will push its growth. 

There are plenty more domains coming out though, so don't miss the rest of the list. And remember—pre-registration is still available, so if you have a specific domain in mind, this is your best chance to grab it before it opens to the public.
