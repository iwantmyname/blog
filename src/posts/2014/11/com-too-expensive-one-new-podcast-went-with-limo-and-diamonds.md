title: .COM too expensive? One new podcast went with .LIMO and .DIAMONDS
excerpt: no
---

For the "do domain extensions really matter" archives. [Gimlet Media](http://gimletmedia.com) just announced its first new podcast yesterday, Reply All. We're not a podcast review site so I won't go into details (tldr: it's a great, story based podcast about the internet), but there's one line in the end credits of the first episode I absolutely loved.

>Do not go to replyall.com. It's too expensive. We didn't want to buy it. Instead, we bought replyall.limo and replyall.diamonds.

Make of it what you will, but I'd say this is a case of "if your thing is popular, people will find you." Don't sacrifice your sane brand name because the .com is takenâ€”there are plenty of alternative [domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) out there, and if what you do is good, people will find you in your corner of the internet.
