<!-- excerpt -->

Let's face it, I, like many of my colleagues, have a bit of a problem. I think of the web as a blank canvas, just waiting for my ideas to populate its empty space. And every time I have a new idea, I do one thing—scramble to grab the corresponding domain name. 

My ongoing quest has gotten a bit easier since the launch of the [new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (being able to get just about any name in some form is a huge time-saver), but the underlying problem still remains. If/when I lose interest trying to make small ideas flourish, I find myself sitting on a pile of empty dreams and untapped potential (at least until the domains expire). 

The real hurdle is the process it takes to create and market new sites. It's much easier today than it was a decade ago, but you still have to design them (although templates are getting better and better), brand them, come up with a consistent content strategy, create a bunch of social accounts and mailing lists, then promote the hell out of them. It's exhausting! 

The proposed solution? From Brian Knapp, in an article titled, [Everything On One Domain](http://retromocha.com/learn/put-everything-on-one-domain/):

>There is so much more value in having everything on this website than there is in having even two or three different domains we are managing.

Further on...

>The best part is when we want to launch something new or explore an idea, we just create a page and put it out there, email our list, and see what people think. Also, we don't have to hunt for a new domain name for every idea we have. We just create a new page and boom, we're done.

>I've found that any time you can increase focus and decrease friction in your business you are better off.

>So, stop buying new domains and start focusing your energy on one domain.

>P.S. Focusing on one domain worked pretty well for Apple, it might work for you too.

So I firmly agree with the one-site-all-product mentality for a lot of things (most of my ideas certainly don't need full sites), but I don't think it's quite the one-size-fits-all solution the author suggests. Yes, using one domain for everything in the brand "worked pretty well for Apple" (although one could argue that Beats and FileMaker break the narrative), but would it have been good for Lifehacker to have started on a big, bundled Gawker Media site, or your local restaurant group to roll up its various entities into one big menu monster?

For one, when you pile everything into one domain, you're severely limiting your branding options. Instead of giving every new project start its own personality, you're all but forced to roll everything into your overarching aesthetic. That's fine for a small dev shop, or even a giant cohesive brand like Apple, but what happens when your ideas jump from music production to digital photography to urban farming? Might you want separate concepts then?

And, by putting all your ideas on one domain, are you limiting each idea's potential success/growth? Would Twitter be Twitter if, in 2006, it shared a page with Odeo? Or would Basecamp have ever become a huge success if 37 Signals didn't roll it out on its own?

But alas, like most things, it all depends on what you're looking to accomplish. If you're finding yourself piling up domains to tickle your every fancy, it may be wise to take the advice of Brian Knapp. For me, my personal brand would be infinitely stronger if I'd just consolidated my random work over the years. 

Don't be afraid to break out though. As I said before, the new gTLDs make it easier than ever to find great domain names ([straying from .com is A-ok](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html) in my opinion), and in the scheme of things, the costs associated are fairly minimal. Just know that with every new site/project you create, whether it's on your current site or a new one, you're either stretching your capabilities to some degree or neglecting something old—and very few good things in life come from divided focus.

As the wise Kenny Rodgers [once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn481KcjvMo), "You've got to know when to hold 'em. Know when to fold 'em. Know when to walk away. And know when to run."
