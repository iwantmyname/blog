<!-- excerpt -->

The [generic top-level domain (gTLD) program](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) launched with a bang, but the month of October was a bit slower than the rest. Last month, only six domain extensions went live, but one particular TLD made a big wave—.NYC, which is already the eighth most popular extension available (still well behind .Berlin for the top spot for city extensions). 

This month, things are picking back up a bit, with 15 domains coming out—and a few of them seem to be destined for the [top 25](http://ntldstats.com/tld) (.help seems like a good bet). Predicting domain extension popularity is certainly an inexact science though, so before I go off and put on my prognostication hat, here's the full November list.
