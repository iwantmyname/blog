We're not really in the business of pushing one top-level domain (TLD) over another (we love all our children the same), but before the launch of these new domain extensions, one TLD seemed to be more active than the rest. Instead of letting things come down to chance, the team behind [.CLUB](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) did real legwork—actively starting conversations and making things happen. 

And their hard work seems to be paying off, as .CLUB is now the [most popular](http://namestat.org/) new generic top-level domain (gTLD) on the market, with daily growth more than 10x that of the second place gTLD, [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru). And that growth doesn't seem to be slowing down. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

In an [article this morning](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/05/27/in-da-club-50-cent-new-tld/) about .CLUB's launch party in New York, Andrew Allemann makes a really good point about gTLDs as a whole. He says, "If I’m going to register new top level domain names, I really want to see the registry promoting the heck out of it. So far .Club is in rare company on this front."

The reason so many people are still afraid of straying from the .COM namespace is because it's synonymous with the internet. If it's a website, it's a .COM. And the only way that's going to change is if people are willing to do the work needed to spread the message, which is exactly what .CLUB is trying to do. If it were up to them, every club of every kind (dance club, gold club, chess club, etc.) would have a .CLUB site, and it would be so common that it would be the TLD of choice by reflex. No decision between .COM and .CLUB—if it's a club, it's a .CLUB (maybe they should run with that!).

And that's really the message every new gTLD is trying to spread, only .CLUB isn't being passive about it. 

The real question now is whether or not .CLUB will stay in that spot for an extended period of time. My gut feeling is that web-centric gTLDs like [.APP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app) and [.BLOG](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog) will eventually win out, but you never know what will happen when people try hard enough.
