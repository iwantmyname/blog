<!-- excerpt -->

You may recall that we [made a commitment](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/12/for-our-birthday-were-giving-back-and-you-should-too.html) last year to contribute a portion of our earnings towards charitable purposes. [Typhoon Haiyan](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html) was one of the most powerful tropical storms in recorded history and led to over 6,000 deaths when it struck the Philippines in November 2013. With the island nation sitting near our own back doorstep in Asia-Pacific, it was not a difficult choice where to spend the money this year.

We looked really hard at the many aid agencies working in the region and weighed up a number of indices demonstrating effectiveness. In the end we invested via Save The Children and specifically asked that the donation go towards recovery operations in the Philippines.

Six months on from the disaster it has been heart-warming to observe media coverage of how emergency aid agencies have been helping the people of the affected region get their lives back on track. Food, water, medical supplies, housing, sanitation, communicationsâ€”the list of needs is endless. Thank-you for supporting iwantmyname, so that we could make a small contribution to the effort.
