It has already been a very busy year at iwantmyname, and once again we're right back into supporting local events and communities here in New Zealand. This year, Lenz and I took up an invitation to be mentors at [Lightning Lab](http://lightninglab.co.nz/), a web venture accelerator that promotes lean methodologies and has attracted angel investment from far and wide. Lightning Lab takes very early stage web start-ups and puts them through a TechStars style programme that challenges founders to break down and reconstruct every aspect of their business.

For the second year running [Lightning Lab Demo Day](http://demoday.lightninglab.co.nz/) presented ventures that stayed the course, putting their best feet forward with a pitch to a large group of potential angel investors and with the support of the wider tech start-up community. Showcase projects ranged across the spectrum. [CoachSeek](http://coachseek.com/) is an application that handles the administrative burden for sports coaches and has already signed 300 customers worldwide. [Cogo](http://archived.link/http://www.cogodigital.co.nz/) is an online knowledge management tool for small and medium sized businesses. [MishGuru](http://mish.guru/) grabbed a cool new [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru) domain off us and bravely rebuilt their proposal from the ground up, reconfiguring as an overlay that helps businesses leverage popular social media service SnapChat.

[Twingl](http://twin.gl/) was a project that formed at a recent Startup Weekend event and we've been following the team with interest ever since. Their stated goal is to contribute to the evolution of human intelligence by improving the way we manage multiple sources of information in the browser. [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/) helps designers more easily deploy, host and maintain fully self-managed websites. In fact, we liked Cloud Cannon so much that we integrated their offering into our [app marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/cloud-cannon-custom-domains). 

In many respects, Lightning Lab Demo Day has become the premium event for showcasing tech start-ups here in New Zealand, and it is heartening to see our start-up ecosystem emerging on the global stage. Many hurdles still lie ahead for these companies as they look to raise cash, build out their offering and get noticed in a busy online world, but I'm pleased that we've been able to help in a small way towards getting them started on this journey.
