title: "It's OK to use tools"

<!-- excerpt -->

Jonas Downey on his [process to improve a website](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/3752-its-ok-not-to-use-tools) for a local non-profit animal shelter - via Signal v. Noise:

> Today, a basic HTML/CSS site seems almost passé. But why? Is it because our new tools are so significantly better, or because we’ve gone overboard complicating simple things?
> 
> As builders, we like tools and tech because they’re interesting and new, and we enjoy mastering them. But when you think about the people we’re building for, the reality is usually the opposite. They need simple designs, clear writing, less tech, and fewer abstractions. They want to get stray animals adopted, not fuss around with website stuff.

As builders, it *is* OK to use tools if they're designed to help the people you're building for. We know how a site should look and feel, so why not use a [website builder](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder) like [Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url), [Weebly](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address) or [Wix](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/wix-make-flash-website-own-url) to set it up, then pass on the final result to the clients to manage?

I'm currently in the process of redoing a website for a small local gym as a side project, and I could develop their site from scratch or on a self-hosted CMS. But instead, I've decided to use a [hosted platform](https://iwantmyname.com/services) instead. They've come a long way in the last few years, and they let me achieve my client's goals while giving them the ability to manage and edit their content without help in the future.
