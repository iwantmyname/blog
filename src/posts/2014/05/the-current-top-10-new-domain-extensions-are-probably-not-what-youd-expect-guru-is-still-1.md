title: "The current top 10 new domain extensions are probably not what you'd expect (.GURU is still #1)"

---

<!-- excerpt -->

Going into the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), I fully expected the domain extensions that fit sites into nice categories would be the most popular. But instead, the current top 10 is an interesting collection of professional, generic and non-Latin TLDs. We have:

1. [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru)
2. [.BERLIN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin)
3. [.PHOTOGRAPHY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography)
4. [.在线](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF)
5. [.EMAIL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-email)
6. [.LINK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link)
7. [.TODAY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-today)
8. [.TIPS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tips)
9. [.COMPANY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company)
10. [.中文网](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91)

There are a few things to keep in mind though when looking at the current top 10. For one, these gTLDs are still very new, so we don't really know what will happen once the general public catches on.

Also, the current numbers are skewed by registries parking domains themselves. From Andrew Allemann - [Domain Name Wire](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/04/16/uniregistry-activates-thousands-of-reserved-domains-per-tld/):

>It’s all a mirage.

>Yesterday Uniregistry activated its reserved domain names in top level domains that have launched so far, massively increasing the size of its zones. It accounts for basically all of the growth in .sexy and .tattoo.

>Judging by some quick checks, it appears that the majority of domains in .link, which just launched with 20,000+ domains in the zone file, are actually domains reserved by the registry.

So take these numbers as a grain of salt, but don't discount the general popularity of the new TLDs as a whole. There are [currently](http://ntldstats.com/) 638,083 new gTLDs registered, and many of the most promising extensions aren't even launched yet. 

Like [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi)! It'd be great to see New Zealand's funky new domain extension sneak onto next month's list.
