<!-- excerpt -->

We're probably closer than we'd ever think to fully migrating from traditional computers to mobile hybrids, so it seemed appropriate to highlight the platforms in our [App Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services) that are ahead of the curve. From mobile blogging to full-on page editing, you could almost run your entire presence via mobile with the help of these six platforms and their apps.

<!-- /excerpt -->

[Jimdo](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/jimdo-custom-domain) ([page](http://www.jimdo.com/mobile/)/[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id588950703?mt=8&ls=1)): Aside from being beautiful, Jimdo's mobile app lets you write blog posts, add photos and monitor your site's analytics.

[RebelMouse](https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/rebelmouse-custom-domain) ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rebelmouse/id725539211?ls=1&mt=8)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rebelmouse.android)): Compiling your online presence into one site is a nifty idea, and the RebelMouse app completely sets you free from your computer. You can create posts from any photo, link or page, share and repost tweets and messages and view other RebelMouse pages in a standardized stream.

[Roon](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/roon-custom-domain) ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roon/id634949849?mt=8)): Markdown fans will love using the Roon app, as its content editor rivals many of the Markdown editors in the App Store. 

[Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url) ([page](http://www.squarespace.com/apps/)): Squarespace doesn't have a traditional do-it-all app, but instead has a suite of apps, including [Blog](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squarespace-blog/id715084234?ls=1&mt=8), [Metrics](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squarespace-metrics/id730533177?ls=1&mt=8), [Portfolio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squarespace-portfolio/id569181277?ls=1&mt=8) and [Note](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/squarespace-note/id561237934?ls=1&mt=8). All the apps are currently for iOS, but Android development is currently underway.  

[Tumblr](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/blogs/tumblr-tumblelog-easy-blog-with-own-url) ([page](http://www.tumblr.com/apps), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404?mt=8), [Android](http://www.tumblr.com/download/android?referrer=apps_page), [Windows](http://www.tumblr.com/download/windows?referrer=apps_page)): Tumblr has always been one of the best for letting you post from any platform (even via voice on your phone), and the app is just one more method for you to get your content to the world. You can share photos, videos, quotes, chats, links and text—and it even has an offline mode for those moments you just can't find a connection.

[Weebly](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/weebly-create-free-website-with-own-address) ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weebly/id511158309?mt=8)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weebly.android)): Weebly's mobile app gives you full control over the content of your blog, store or website. And the app isn't just a content editor—you can build entire sites and stores using the drag-and-drop site creator and theme library.
