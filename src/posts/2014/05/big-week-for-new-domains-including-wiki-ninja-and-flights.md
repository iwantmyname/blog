title: Big week for new domains, including .WIKI, .NINJA and .FLIGHTS

----

<!-- excerpt -->

May has been a relatively slow month for generic Top-Level Domains (at least by quantity... [.CLUB](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) has been huge), but this last week is a big one. Over the course of two days, we have eight gTLDs coming out, with a couple of them sure to hover around the top 20 in popularity. We have:

###The week for travel TLDs

Travel planning is a major industry on the web, and this week .CRUISES, .FLIGHTS, .RENTALS, .VACATIONS and .VILLAS are all going live on the same day. Judging by the current [top 10 gTLDs](http://ntldstats.com/), overall popularity seems to come from a combination of memorability and price—and on the memorability front, all of these TLDs come in around seven characters, which isn't too long. But the prices  could be a non-starter for some, coming in at $39 and $59 USD. For serious sites though, there's a real opportunity here to get prime names for far less than on the .COM aftermarket.
