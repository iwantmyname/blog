<!-- excerpt -->

We're always happy to highlight the great platforms coming out of the Wellington, NZ tech scene, but we're especially happy to have [Hoist](http://hoistapps.com/) right in our backyard (and in our [App Marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/hoist-custom-domain) for simple one-click iwantmyname installs).

To get a bit more info about the company and what their future holds, we reached out to [Owen Evans](http://hoistapps.com/blog/meet-owen-evans/), Hoist's co-founder and CTO with a few questions.

**iwmn:** Naming is always an interesting topic for startups. How did you come up with the name Hoist?

**Owen:** I'd love to say there was an interesting and long time spent over Hoist as a name, but it came early in the piece. I've always believed in brand as something for people to get a sense of community about, and having a solid name was going to be important.

Back in June 2013 we got together to work out what we were going to try and solve and what we wanted from a business. Part of the process was to give ourselves a name and we spent an hour throwing words related to applications, cloud, software and infrastructure on a whiteboard.

We then discussed a few key words that worked well as evocative imagery, but Hoist became a clear favorite and has done well to represent what we're trying to achieve (helping people get their applications into the cloud).

**iwmn:** You're based in New Zealand. Do you see this as a disadvantage as a startup and what are the main challenges?

Pros: New Zealand is like nowhere else on earth, it's such an amazing lifestyle that there are few times I wish I was elsewhere. We have the ability to enjoy the great outdoors, a closely connected tech and entrepreneurial scene and a great support network for aspiring entrepreneurs. I moved to Wellington from London and I often wonder if I would have been able to start a company there, just because in the time I've been in New Zealand I've met so many supportive and awesome people who made it much more possible for me personally to start out.

Cons: Unfortunately, there's no getting away from the remoteness of NZ, and you really have to live here to understand truly what that means (I keep having to point out to my friends back in the UK that the closest place not in NZ is a three hour plane ride) That leads to a bunch of issues around cost of supply and such, but also leads to a lot of support for software startups as there's a recognition that they could transform the NZ economy.

We also have a very small native market; to put it in perspective there are more small businesses in California than people in NZ, that means your core market and sources of capital are likely to be offshore. that means a fair bit of travel and market research to understand the main market.

**iwmn:** What's the difference between Hoist and other cloud hosting platforms like Heroku?

**Owen:** Hoist and Heroku both provide ways to host cloud apps, but where Heroku's focus leans more to infrastructure, Hoist leans more to integrations. We've built the easiest way for a developer to create a "feature app" - i.e. to extend existing cloud apps with bespoke features as well as for single page applications built entirely in Javascript/HTML.

As SaaS becomes more and more prevalent and SMBs take on a best-of-breed approach to SaaS, there are a lot of these light-weight apps and integrations happening. Our platform is ideal for connecting to an API and adding value through a well designed user interface with a Hoist backend.

**iwmn:** We see that you've [recently added](http://hoistapps.com/blog/ship-day-new-hoist-features/) buckets and connectors  to Hoist--what kinds of upgrades/additions are you guys working on next?

**Owen:** We're working on making application upload better (we're aware our current file upload solution was a bit janky; integrations such as Github and Dropbox will make that better), adding APIs for GeoOp, WorkflowMax and others as well as some work on building an API to make SaaS billing much easier for small businesses.

We're also focusing on a few commercial apps going live thanks to EndGame, and as such we've got a few features being built out from there.

**iwmn:** Having an awesome tech stack is like a badge of honor for us, and it looks like yours is quite nice, too. What are you running on?

**Owen:** Hoist is primarily built on Node.js and MongoDB. We originally used CouchDB as well, but it meant one too many things for us to manage in house. Node.js was picked primarily because we saw that the language of the cloud was JSON and it made sense to transform as little as possible for understandability and speed. We love working on the stack as it's quick, easy to use and performs really well.

We also manage all our server configuration using Chef, which makes setting up servers a breeze and plays nicely with all the cloud infrastructure we use.
