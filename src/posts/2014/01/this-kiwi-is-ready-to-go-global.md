<!-- excerpt -->

As Kiwis ourselves, we're extremely excited about [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi)'s official delegation, making it the first updated Kiwi domain to hit the web. In a way, it marks a new era for the internet in New Zealand, as we expect to see .CO.NZ fall out a bit in favor of the newer, shorter alternatives. But as a lover of the [quirky bird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi), I personally hope it also gets adopted in all corners of the globe. 

As far as purchasing/pre-ordering goes, here's the abridged version:

<!-- /excerpt -->

+ The vast majority of .KIWI domains will be available for the standard price at iwantmyname. [Pre-ordering is open now](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi), so get in before the Top-Level Domain officially launches.
+ For many "premium" names like airfare.kiwi and talking.kiwi, you have to [purchase them directly through Dot Kiwi](https://dot-kiwi.com/premiumnames). Prices for some domains are on the steep side, but for some sites, unified branding is a top priority.
+ If you do purchase a premium .KIWI domain from Dot Kiwi, you can always [transfer it to us](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-transfer) to take advantage of our domain management platform. Transfer prices will be announced as soon as pricing goes public.

As always, we'll be sure to post more about .KIWI as we receive more information. And if you have any questions about .KIWI or the pre-ordering process, [please let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
