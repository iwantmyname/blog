[From Anthony Casalena - Squarespace Blog:](http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/ten-years)

> Technology shapes everything we experience on a day-to-day basis. We would not have photographs to put online if cameras were never invented. We would not have words to share unless we had language and books. We would not have these ideas merging together into websites without the invention of computers and the Internet. All of these components are building blocks that we as people can stand on to reach bigger things.
>
> Squarespace is part of this bigger idea: Everyone is a creator. As a company, we make tools that help all of us put our ideas into the world. We're only ten years into these efforts. It's a scale of challenge that can be pursued for decades.

[Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url) is easily one of the biggest names in web publishing at the moment, but in the fast-paced world of tech, it's quite refreshing to remember how long they've been at it. Since 2004, Squarespace has been delivering professional-level publishing tools that easily rival the look and feel of well-made custom sites. And since the launch of Squarespace 6 in July 2012, the platform has grown exponentially.
