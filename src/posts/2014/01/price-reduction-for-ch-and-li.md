<!-- excerpt -->

It's never fun to announce a price increase, but who doesn't like a good price decrease? Well today we're happy to announce a price reduction for two domains:

### Every word ends with .CH

Ok, that's obviously an exaggeration, but if you're looking for a solid domain hack, Switzerland's .CH domain might be the best Top-Level Domain (TLD) out there. Just look at the [words that end in "ch" on the Scrabble Word Finder](http://www.scrabblefinder.com/ends-with/ch/) (possibly my favorite tool ever). Telestich. Resketch. Squelch. Or any variation of the word "Tech." The possibilities are enormous. And now you can get one for [$24.90 USD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/ch-swiss-domain-name-registration-for-switzerland).

### Liechtenstein is for .LIkers

Liechtenstein may be one of the smallest countries on the planet, but its also one of the most well-to-do. But the .LI domain isn't just for the local economy--it's a great TLD for creative domains. Just look at brands like [paper.li](http://paper.li) and [Flowli](http://flow.li) to see its potential. And now you can get your own [.LI domain for only $24.90 USD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/li-liechtensteiner-domain-name-registration-for-liechtenstein).
