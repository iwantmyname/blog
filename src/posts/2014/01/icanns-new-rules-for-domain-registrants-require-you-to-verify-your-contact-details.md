title: "ICANN's new rules for domain registrants require you to verify your contact details"

Rules. You can't live with them, you can't have a domain without them. And starting January 2014, there are some **important new rules to be aware of**. These rules are set by the internet's governing body ICANN and affect all generic top-level domains (gTLDs) such as .COM, .NET, .ORG, .BIZ, .INFO or .NAME as well as upcoming new gTLDs.

### Domains will be disabled, if you don't verify them

Starting next week, when you register a domain with new contact details, transfer existing domains or change the registrant (owner) or email address on your contact information, you will receive an additional email with an activation link. **If you don't press this link, your domain will be disabled after 15 days**.

You need to verify your contact details if you:

- purchase a domain with iwantmyname for the first time
- have updated your iwantmyname account details
- transferred a domain to iwantmyname and changed the contacts

**I repeat, if you don't react to these emails, new ICANN policies mandate that we will have to disable your domain name. Even if you're in Antarctica and have no internet access. Even if your spam folder eats it alive.**

Specifically, if your 15 day verification window passes, your website will be replaced by a website displaying a verification error, along with instructions on how to fix it. But on the plus side, it can be fixed. And if you do renew it on time, this domain email verification will only happen once.

### So what should you do now?

As soon as you are able, please ensure that your domain name is associated with a valid email address. The last thing we want is for you to make a change, then have your verification email sent to an old address.

Also, if you purchase a domain or make a change after January 2014 and don't receive an email, or if you just have questions about the new ICANN rules, [please get in touch](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
