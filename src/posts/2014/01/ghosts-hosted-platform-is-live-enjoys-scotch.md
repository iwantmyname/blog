2014 is looking to be a big year for Ghost, but the biggest news of all came at the tail-end of 2013. 

[From John O'Nolan - Ghost:](http://blog.ghost.org/hosted-platform-open/)

> Today we are bringing you an announcement from Ghost HQ that has been cooking for rather a long time: The Ghost Hosted Platform is now available to absolutely everyone.
>
> With the Ghost hosted platform, each blog is an independent install of the Ghost software. It's not connected to any other blogs. This means that we can allow you to run apps (plugins) or custom themes or do (almost) anything you want. This was a really critical point for us, because we didn't just want to create this platform as something "easy" - suited to beginners. We wanted to make it easy and create the best possible infrastructure for running Ghost that's available on the web. Giving publishers and developers full control over their Ghost blog is the most important piece of that puzzle.

So, for those not familiar with how Ghost works, you can now either go with the new Ghost-hosted version, or the standard self-hosted version. Here's how it works:

+ Ghost hosted - With Ghost's new hosting platform, they are able to provide a stable, platform-optimized experience--[for a price](https://ghost.org/pricing/). Monthly prices range from $5/month for 1 blog and up to 10,000 views/month, then go all the way to millions of hits and unlimited blogs for the price of "let's talk" (the step down is $80/month). But remember, you're paying for a very nice hosting service, and because Ghost is a non-profit, you can trust that all the money will go back into making the platform even better.

+ Self hosted - Self-hosted Ghost is a lot like Wordpress.org in the fact that it's totally free, provided you have some hosting space to put it on. If you're looking for some nice choices, [this is a good place to start](https://iwantmyname.com/features/domains/web-hosting).

In other news, [Ghost 0.4 is out](http://blog.ghost.org/ghost-0-4/), giving the platform a number of handy new features. Static pages, for one, now give site owners the option to create About pages, Contact forms and any number of pages that wouldn't typically appear in a normal post feed. Also, featured posts and a quick edit system makes working with posts easier than ever. Basically "It's a cleaner, faster, more sophisticated Ghost all round. It enjoys Johnnie Walker Blue Label Scotch, Mozart, and the refined flavour of a premium cigar."

If you're ready to give Ghost a try, head over to [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org/) to sign up ([but don't forget to grab your domain here first](https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/ghost-custom-domain)). It really is an incredible platform, and we're thrilled to see it moving along as well as it has after its highly publicized [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform).
