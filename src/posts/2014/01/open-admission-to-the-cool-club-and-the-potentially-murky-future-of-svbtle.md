<!-- excerpt -->

I personally discovered [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/) a few years back, when MG Siegler's [*Massive Greatness*](http://massivegreatness.com/) blog started getting picked up by [Techmeme](http://techmeme.com/). His writing wasn't really any different than his usual fare (although I think this was shortly after the AOL purchase of Techcrunch, so [his soapbox was never larger](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/the-end/))—but the platform he was on was kind of a big deal.

As a writer, I was used to having access to any blog platform I wanted to be on. Sure, I couldn't hop on a site like Techcrunch and start blogging, but nothing could stop me from creating a Wordpress site of my own. But *Massive Greatness* wasn't on Wordpress—it was on Svbtle, and Svbtle was a beautifully minimalist platform only open to the movers and shakers of the tech world.

[Here's a great Quora answer from Paul Scrivens from March 2012 about what Svbtle was all about](http://www.quora.com/Svbtle/What-is-Svbtle-all-about):

> With the Svbtle network, it isn't so much about writing long articles or anything truly original, but being able to dive into the minds of the people that Dustin (Curtis) holds in high esteem.

[And here's a bit from Dustin himself:](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle)

> I wrote this engine entirely for myself, without the intention of opening it up to other people. But since realizing that it has improved the way I think and write, I've decided to open it up to a small number of vetted bloggers. At least at first. The goal is simple: when you see the Svbtle design, you should know that the content is guaranteed to be great. Network bloggers are encouraged to keep quality high at the expense of everything else. 

It was—in my eyes—the unofficial start of the internet "Cool Club." In one fell swoop, I realized that I didn't have the clout to be on a platform. I was on the outside (but I did get an early Google+ invite! Crickets...).

But then the Svbtle buzz started to wane. The people who were happily peering into the Svbtle tech-celebrity windows suddenly became bombarded with XOXO clips, tech conversations on Twitter and countless podcast cameos. Svbtle wasn't new and cool anymore—it was clear (to me at least) that the platform needed a change.

[January 28th, From Dustin Curtis - Svbtle:](http://blog.svbtle.com/open-for-everyone)

> Until now, we've been an exclusive platform open only to approved users. We took this initial approach because we wanted to ensure that the software worked, first of all, and that the platform was seeded with great content by seasoned and experienced authors. Now we're finally ready to let more people try Svbtle. Today, we're opening sign up for everyone.

That's great news! Right?

Wellllll. Sure. Now I can use it, but as [mijustin on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mijustin) puts it, "Who needs this? Who is pulling out their hair looking for a new hosted publishing platform that they don't control?" The one thing that truly differentiated Svbtle wasn't its uniqueness, it was its exclusivity. As far as design goes, the blog-platform world caught up, and now it's just one of the bunch. Silvrback, Roon, Squarespace, Virb, Ghost—the list of clean blog platforms goes on and on, and more seem to be created every month or so. 

And aside from that, where's the money is going to come from? As of now, the platform is entirely free (and [free is always scary](http://www.information-age.com/technology/security/1290603/facebook-is-%22deliberately-killing-privacy%22-says-schneier)), bolstered only by VC funding, but as of a year ago the real money was going to come from monetizing content—presumably the quality content created by his merry bunch of well-known bloggers. Dustin Curtis, the creator of Svbtle, said himself in a [Techcrunch interview](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/08/with-funding-for-svbtle-dustin-curtis-wants-to-build-a-business-in-long-form-online-content/) that, "Monetizing content, especially written content, is extremely difficult. I think Svbtle's biggest innovation will be in this area, but I don't know what it is yet."

With an expected wave of new users, I think it's safe to say that there will be plenty of new content to leverage, but without the commitment to quality, will it be good? Is there any way Svbtle can "keep quality high at the expense of everything else," even when the platform is completely open?

I guess we'll see. It seems more likely to me that Svbtle will release some sort of premium service with a monthly fee, but I'd love for Dustin to figure out his innovative monetization scheme and keep things free for the user. Svbtle is definitely polished enough (and Dustin Curtis certainly seems creative enough) to do something exciting, but it's now competing in a crowded space without an obvious plan. 

Brace yourself for a rough ride.

On a separate note, we're very happy to say that Svbtle allows you to use custom domains! As the post Svbtle post from above states:

> Writers shouldn't be defined by the brands of their publishers or platform, but rather by their own personal presence on the web. So we've built features that enable you to own your space inside Svbtle: Your full name appears by everything you write, you can use a custom domain, and you can choose an avatar and accent color. We have plans for more personalization and branding features soon, too.

If you're interested in the platform (and you should be, it's quite nice) and need some help setting things up, [definitely let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support).
