title: Need a logo? Squarespace has you covered.

---

[From Anthony Casalena - Squarespace:](http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/introducing-squarespace-logo)

> Squarespace Logo helps anyone create a professional logo on their own. All logos are comprised of a few basic elements: text, a tagline, and an icon. With the help of The Noun Project and Google Fonts, we provide a huge array of icons (7,000 and growing!) and fonts that you can easily turn into a unique logo for your business. To give you an idea of how your logo will look, you can use our handy previews to see your new logo on a business card, a website, or a t-shirt. When you're ready to download your logo, we provide white on black, black on white, and full-color images in a variety of formats.

I've started enough small web projects in my time to know that branding is the single scariest thing for any non-designer to take on. It's like building a house--if you don't have the knowledge or the tools, you have no chance. 

But [Squarespace Logo](http://www.squarespace.com/logo) gives you all the tools you need for something basic, and is so easy to use that it's impossible to screw up (although even Squarespace can't fix bad taste).

So I made one. You know, what the hell.

Functionality is fairly limited at this point--for instance, I couldn't add a second lightning bolt or a pair of underpants to hide the shame of my logo, but I can say that it's super easy to use and quite effective at accomplishing a relatively important task. Also, you don't  need an account to make one. Squarespace Logo is entirely free for everyone to use, and if you love what you make, you can pay $10 for a high-res PNG (free for [Squarespace customers](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url)). 

You really have nothing to lose here, so give it a shot. It's quite fun to play with. And seriously, you can put underpants on your logo!
