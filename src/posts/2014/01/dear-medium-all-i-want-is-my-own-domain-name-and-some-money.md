Dear [Medium](https://medium.com/),

Let me start this by saying that I totally "get" what you're doing. I'm a writer at heart, and when I'm looking to start writing, this is my thought process:

1. I'm going to write something great.
2. I wish my personal site got more traffic.
3. Ugh, maybe I can hook into something social that looks good. I'll give you anything you want if it means I'll get pageviews.

Let's be honest here, if every writer on the web confidently thought they could produce/create/host a polished product that would get thousands of hits, there would be no Medium. You wouldn't exist. But that's not the case. Writers don't want to to deal with the how, they just want to write. And you let them do that.

It's brilliant. It's beautiful. But there's a problem. At the end of the day, *I want to be the destination*. I'm sitting on so many social handles right now it hurts--I want this work to be my own. I want to know that if you go away tomorrow, my content will still have a name that people can find. I mean, these aren't tiny tweets I'm looking to write here--they're longform posts that take a bit of time. 

Here's another way of looking at it. medium.com/@ev probably seems really cool to Ev Williams because you're his baby. You aren't *my* baby. To me, you're just another platform, and the very last thing I want is for more of my thoughts to be stuck to platform handles. 

Here's a small peak as to why:

+ Person 1: Oh man, did you read John's latest post?
+ Person 2: No! Where can I find it?
+ Person 1: He's at @handle.
+ Person 2: On Twitter?
+ Person 1: No.
+ Person 2: Instagram?
+ Person 1: No. 
+ Person 2: Facebook?
+ Person 1: No Person 2, Medium.

Ugh, it's just too much. I feel like I'm stuck with a hundred safety deposit boxes, but no house.

But I like you, Medium. I want to use you. Just let me plug in a little domain name. **And maybe give me a chance to sell subscriptions to my work--writers need money too!** As an impatient blogger, I'm totally fine with your branding and style being everywhere because it looks nice--but I want to feel like some small chunk of my writing is mine. 

Please. It would make a lot of people very happy. 

Love, 
Chris
