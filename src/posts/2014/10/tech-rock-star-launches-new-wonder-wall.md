Australian web developer and tech entrepreneur Stephen Phillips grew up with music in his life from an early age; he played guitar, sang, and even recorded an album, inspired by the successes of popular Aussie rock bands like INXS and Midnight Oil. But his star ascended when he co-founded a little company called We Are Hunted that was subsequently [acquired by Twitter](http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/11/twitters-music-app-is-real-beta-testing-as-we-are-hunted-shuts-down/) in 2013.

His musical background and deep respect for the challenges indie musicians face when promoting new material held him in good stead when he, as CTO, formed Brisbane based Hunted Media in 2009. The firm developed a technology for scouring the internet for emerging music and new artists, and after gaining steam on the web and through various platform apps, was acquired by Twitter to kickstart their #music ambitions. Phillips spent a lot of time working under the Twitter banner in San Francisco, but the project was closed a year after it started, leaving him philosophical about his time in Silicon Valley. Notwithstanding the intense marketing hype and the huge amounts of capital splashed around the Valley, the next big thing will probably end up being a simple roll of the dice and a complete surprise to everyone, he says.

These days, Phillips is enjoying being back home in Queensland, but hasn't given up hacking on music tech. His new project, [wonder.fm](http://wonder.fm/), provides music recommendations based on the top rating tracks found on SoundCloud, a Germany based audio distribution platform with an enormous global following. To create an accessible and clean design, Phillips teamed up with his old mates at [Joseph Mark](http://www.josephmark.com.au/), a highly regarded digital product studio with an impressive music industry clientele. 

While there are no plans at present to push Wonder.fm on any particular growth trajectory, Phillips is simply happy to keep playing around with the code and let other music lovers enjoy the results. He also has an iOS app in the pipeline which will no doubt please the hiperati. Wonder.fm has already been getting a lot of playtime around the iwantmyname office and of course we think the [.FM domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/fm-domain-name-registration-for-federated-states-of-micronesia) is pretty cool as well.
