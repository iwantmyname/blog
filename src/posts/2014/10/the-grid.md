title: "The Grid — AI websites that design themselves"

<!-- excerpt -->

I write content for a living—always have, probably always will. So when I'm looking to create websites (which I do quite often), I try to take advantage of platforms that let me do my thing without needing too much help from designers and developers. 

So imagine the look on my face when I read this:

<!-- /excerpt -->

>This is not another do-it-yourself website builder. The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. As your needs grow, it evolves with you, effortlessly adapting to your needs. Want to add e-commerce? Social feeds? A different layout? The Grid just takes care of it. This is not a website builder. This is your personal AI web developer. Its first masterpiece is the website you're looking at right now. Its next one could be yours.

??? I think the expression could adequately be described as a blend of wide-eyed and slack-jawed. Needless to say, I'm now Founding Member #1173.

If you like to geek out on new platforms as much as I do, definitely check out The Grid's website for yourself. Version 1.0 is set to launch in spring 2015, but if you [sign up for a membership now](https://thegrid.io/#1173) **, you'll be locked in at $8/mo (as opposed to the normal $25/mo).

**Just to be totally transparent, when I signed up, the email receipt had a bit at the bottom, in bold caps, that said, "INVITE 3 FRIENDS AND WE’LL PAY FOR YOUR MEMBERSHIP." So if you use the link above, you're indirectly supporting my "awesome-new-web-platform" addiction.
