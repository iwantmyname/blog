If you're a podcast listener, Alex Blumberg's new show, StartUp, just might be the best new show around. Here's the synopsis, from the StartUp about page:

>I'm Alex Blumberg. My experience is in public radio, as a producer for This American Life and as a co-founder of the business-economics series Planet Money. After years of reporting on other people's businesses, I decided to start my own.

>This show follows what happens next – my difficult journey from man to businessman. It's a classic start-up story, but one that's recorded in real time. I've documented disastrous pitches to investors, difficult conversations with my wife, and tense negotiations with my co-founder. The result is an honest, transparent account of something that happens all the time, but that we can rarely listen in on: starting a business.

I'd definitely recommend starting at the beginning, but the latest episode, titled "How To Name Your Company" is a fantastic look at how hard branding really is. Give it a listen.

The other day I wrote an article asking [whether domain extensions matter anymore](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/10/do-domain-extensions-really-matter-anymore.html), and this episode really got me thinking. If you're creating a company with global business aspirations, do you need to get a .com?

In the episode, Alex Blumberg mentions a handful of tech companies that end with "ly"—and that was due to the brief popularity of the .ly domain extension at the end of the 00's. Bit.ly is one that sticks in my head, and even though the .ly domain now forwards to a .com, the reason for the change was more to do with .ly being the ccTLD for Libya (government instability is never good) than the domain not being successful. 

To me, if you're a new business, the most important aspect is credibility. In 2014, .com is still probably the most credible extension for the average consumer, but we're at a point now where people probably aren't going to blink at .io, .co, .club, or really any extension that doesn't make your name seem spammy or computer generated. So YOURNAME.club probably works, while MISPELLEDNAME.club or YOURNAME567.club probably won't. 

If I had to create a small set of "rules to name by," this would be it:

1. You're free to use any domain extension (and there are a ton of good options now), but people are trained to be wary of salesy or spammy names. Use your best judgement.
2. Whatever you do, make sure your name is spelled correctly. Intentional vowel dropping is fine, but if your domain is "newzeland.TLD," people are rightly going to question your legitimacy. 
3. Don't go to lengths to make your brand name fit into the .com namespace. If your brand name is "Name," you can add one word to it, max. hearName.com, Namemedia.com, useName.com—all ok. Nametryitnow.com is not. We have 226 new [generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) available now, and so many more country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) on top of that, so take advantage!
