title: "Droplr is an exceptionally useful tool for sharing files and screenshots"

---

<!-- excerpt -->

Quietly resting on my desktop nav, next to the icons for Twitter, Dropbox, OnePassword, Wifi and Finder, is the stylized Droplr drop—arguably one of the most useful apps on my computer. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it does, it does quite well.

**It takes, and lets you share, screenshots**: This may be a non-issue on the PC, but in OSX, the default screenshot app, Grab, really isn't all that useful. For one, the default filetype used by Grab is TIFF, which almost always needs to be exported to .jpg or .png for any kind of practical use. And once the shot is taken, there aren't any quick features for highlighting segments or leaving notes—you have to open files in other apps to do anything with them.

Completely replacing Grab on my computer is Droplr, which allows me to take regular screenshots, URL-as-photo screenshots (full-page shots) and "Capture and draw" screenshots, giving me some basic tools for circling key points and adding text.  Then, once your screenshot is taken, it's automatically attached to a link in your clipboard, meaning you're only a cmd-V away from sending your file to a friend or co-worker. 

**And screencasts!**: It's one thing to tell someone how to do something, but showing them is almost always a better solution. So if you want to to show someone how to do a Photoshop effect or just where a basic option is hidden, Droplr screen recordings are definitely the answer. Just drag open a window to record in, do what you need to do, stop the recording, then send the auto-generated link ([like this one](http://iwmn.me/gG8O/5Y16w4yd)). 

**It makes file sharing simple**: For all the efficiency advancements computers have made in the last decade, sending basic files still seems a bit slow. But with Droplr, just select a file (up to 2GB) and hit option-D to copy it to your clipboard to send out (it's great for sending private [dog photos](http://iwmn.me/le6c/4NaMlFYk)).

**All your files are attached to a custom domain**: To me, this is an invaluable feature. When you're sending files around, especially to clients, it's important to establish a level of trust. So first, Droplr allows you to password protect your links and create self-destructing drops. But then it takes the next step and allows you to send links with your very own custom short domain. So instead of sending emails or messages with links to shady files, we can send out links like iwmn.me./XXXXXXX. And the setup is incredibly simple. 

##Adding a custom domain to Droplr

Like all [the best apps and platforms](https://iwantmyname.com/services), adding a custom domain is painless with iwantmyname.

![Add Droplr]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-08-26-droplr-iwmn-add.png)

1. Assuming you already have a short domain registered (if not, start [here](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/customize-droplr-with-your-own-domain)), login to your iwantmyname account and select **Apps & Services** under the **Setup** menu in the top nav. 
2. From here, either type **Droplr** into the search field, or select the app under the **URL Shortener** menu. 
3. Select with domain you want to add Droplr too, then click **Install Droplr**.
4. Now, sign into your Droplr account (or [start here](https://droplr.com/hello) to sign up) and click **Settings** in the bottom nav.
5. Turn on **Custom Domain** (you'll need a [Pro](https://droplr.com/hello) account) and type in your short domain, then hit Save.
6. When you send your short domain, it'll now look like short.tld/XXXX. If someone tried to go to short.tld though, they'd be redirected to droplr.com. To prevent this, under custom domain in the **Settings** screen, add your primary domain into the **Root Redirect** field. For us, that automatically redirects iwmn.me to iwantmyname.com, and for you it'll do the same, but with your domain. 

And that's it. Now when you shorten links, send files or big screencasts, the link provided will be properly branded. If you're having any issues with the setup process though, don't hesitate to [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support). We're always here to help.
