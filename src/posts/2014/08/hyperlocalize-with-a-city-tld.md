Amongst the craziness that are the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), cities seem to be a bastion of pragmatism. They just make senseâ€”if your company or brand is localized to a city, a city TLD gives your site an easily remembered identifier in a namespace that will have much less competition.

Back in July, [I wrote](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/cities-are-a-good-bet-for-new-domain-extension-success.html), "Around the world (aside from the US), county-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are hugely popular, with .co.uk domain extension registrations in particular numbering well into the millions. And that sort of localized naming scheme seems to translate well to cities, with .Berlin currently sitting as the second most popular gTLD currently available."

Looking at [nTLDStats](http://ntldstats.com/tld), .Berlin's popularity is holding up (still in the #2 spot), and the recently launched .Tokyo and .Wien (Vienna) are also quite popular at #16 and #45 respectively. City TLD popularity seems to be inevitable at this point (at least for big cities), and we'll get an idea of just how popular they'll be starting August 27th with .Hamburg, and continuing into the end of the year with .Capetown, .Durban and .Joburg, with more likely to come throughout 2015.
