There are countless sites on the web dishing out advice for how you should name your website/company, but sometimes the very best recommendation is to look at what's currently popular. And [Domain Name Wire](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/08/26/quickly-find-the-top-websites-built-on-new-tlds/) recently found a great site for this—[Domain Punch](https://domainpunch.com/topm/).

<!-- /excerpt -->

What Domain Punch does is list the Alexa top million websites, then lets you sort by top-level domain (TLD). So if you want to see the most popular sites on the web using .guru or .kiwi, you can (as long as the TLD has a site in the top million). It's really handy, and best of all, it's totally free to use ([Domain Incite Pro](http://domainincite.com/pro/) has a similar tool, but you have to be a paying customer).

Domain Name Wire does bring up a good point though. "Now, a big caveat: these tools are based on Alexa data. Alexa is notoriously inaccurate. It’s just directionally correct. Domains separated by ranks of 10,000 and even 100,000 might actually be reversed for true traffic volume." So take the rankings you see with a grain of salt—I'd recommend using this more for idea generation than stat collection.
