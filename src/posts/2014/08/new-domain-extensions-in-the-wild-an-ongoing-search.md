<!-- excerpt -->

We've now launched more than 150 new [generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), and as expected, they're each experiencing different levels of popularity. Some, like [.berlin](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin), .[club](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) and [.在线](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF) are doing quite well, but none have blown up to the level of mass acceptance—none are considered normal yet. 

To get to that point, we need to start seeing more of these sites in the wild. Ideally, a big brand will kickstart the movement by transitioning their .com to a new gTLD, but there are already a number of sites that have made the switch. Here are a few of the best/most interesting we've found so far.
