<!-- excerpt -->

I think it's safe to say that the [new generic-top level domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) (gTLDs) have been a moderate success up to this point. If you take a look at ntldstat.com's [new gTLD registrations chart](http://ntldstats.com/), you won't find dramatic gains, but the line is consistently trending upwards with more gTLDs coming out each week. And that's not likely to change. 

At some point though, the success of the new gTLDs won't be determined by numbers (numbers can be skewed), but by visibility. Specifically, by the amount of big sites that use gTLDs as their primary internet outposts. So while we wait for BMW.com to become BMW.auto, we can hold ourselves over with Domain Incite Pro's [newly released feature](http://domainincite.com/pro/popular-new-gtld-domains/) that tracks sites using new gTLDs by [Alexa Rank](http://www.alexa.com/topsites). 

There aren't any sites using gTLDs in the Alexa top 500 yet, but there are 34 in the top 100,000 (which is a big deal considering the new domain extensions are still fairly new). I won't list them out individually (some could be malicious), but breaking them out by gTLD shows some pretty interesting trends.

##Takeaways

+ Shorter TLDs seem to be doing much better than longer ones (which makes sense), with only five of the top 34 having more than a five-letter domain extension. If this trend holds, it doesn't bode well for the longer gTLDs yet to come out.
+ .XYZ, the top gTLD in overall registrations, only appears once in the Alexa top 100,000. Given its relative newness, this doesn't come as too much of a surprise, but it's hard to know what percentage of its 300,000+ applications are just junk to inflate stats.
+ .CLUB has been quite aggressive with their marketing (in certain circles), and it's paid off, making up more than 25% of the list. Poor 50 Cent's [50inda.club](http://50inda.club/) site didn't make the Alexa top million though. 
+ .GURU was the leader on the overall popularity list for a good amount of time (it's currently in fourth), but only one of its sites made the list. Sure, it's the most popular site on the Alexa list at #710, but I do wonder how popular .GURU will be once the initial popularity wears off. 
+ The general thought is that if gTLDs are ever going to become truly popular, more than one will have to hit it big. And with 16 different domain extensions on the list, the popularity is spread out pretty evenly.
