We regularly post articles to help you get started with your own website, whether it's [expected costs for a business site](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/a-detailed-breakdown-of-what-small-business-websites-cost.html), [how to economically showcase your photos](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/build-a-modern-hosted-photo-gallery-website.html), or [really easy ways to get a domain and site up and running](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/squarespace-iwantmyname-makes-website-building-a-snap.html). 

But then what? In the same way that just buying a domain won't magically make a website appear, getting your website online won't magically make customers, audience, or community appear. As a side note, while SEO can be an important part of building your presence online, we're not going to get into it in this post, as that's a whole other big, complex topic. For an intro though, [this is a great start](http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo).

Let's take a look at some things to think about and research. We'll also get into some actions to take to build your profile and engagement online and encourage people to visit your site. You could be trying to grow your customer base, build a community, or assemble an audience/fan base. People are people no matter how you're interacting with them, so these tactics can be broadly applied.

##What are you trying to build?

This may seem like an obvious one, but there are often nuances. In the same way a startup's target market isn't "everyone", neither is the target audience or community for your site. 

People want it to be clear if they're being sold something. They rarely like it if they think they're just hanging out with friends... and then get pitched. If you're building a small business, great, be friendly and welcoming, but also keep in mind the things people want from a business website. That is, clear information about the products or services, pricing, shipping, ways to contact you, etc.

If you're trying to grow a community around a shared interest or other catalyst, you need to have a clear idea of who you want the community members to be. How will you design the site, functions, and onboarding process to make it as attractive to the right potential members as possible? If someone stumbles upon it expecting something entirely different they're likely to end up frustrated, and it can be awkward for existing members.

If you're looking for an audience, note that developing it can be quite different from building community, and is not intended to be fully interactive, but rather more broadcast-centric. Internet culture these days tends to be such that many people expect interactions to be inclusive (think Reddit or parenting blogger communities). 

To develop your personal or business brand and build an audience, you'll need to think more along the lines of celebrities, athletes, etc. whose sites are developed more to broadcast and share information with their fans, but not necessarily to interact with them on a large scale. (Though many of these sites have fan community areas where fans can interact with each other.)

##Who else is doing what you want to do?

It is very unlikely that you are the first or only person doing what you want to do. (And if you are, there's probably a good reason there aren't others.) It may be a sparsely populated niche; it may be be well established and thriving. Do your research. 

Know who the well-known names and established communities are. What are the sucessful brands? How do they approach and interact with others, and what do they focus on? What do they do that is popular and that you would like to do, too? (As the saying goes, good artists borrow, great artists steal...) This is not to say that you should just copy wholesale what others are doing, but there are tried and true methods to build audience, sales, and community interactions.

One of the other big reasons to know who the other people in your area are is that one of the best ways to build your own presence is by getting out there. Interact with others and enhance their experience where you can. Don't sit and wait for them to come to you. Join in, be part of existing communities. It's also important to note where your target audience or community hangs out online. Not all groups use the same sites or tools, nor are all sites or tools well suited to all kinds of interactions.

Now, this is not to say you should just show up on others' sites, blogs, or forums and start spouting off about how great you are or your stuff is and how much everything else sucks and how they should all come to you. Remember, this is a social sphere like any other, and you're the newcomer. Read, pay attention. Learn who the main players are, who the lurkers are, what topics are popular. Then, if there's an opportunity to genuinely share an opinion or expertise, feel free. 

If your contributions are useful and you're pleasant and respectful, people will be interested in who you are, and may go check out your site or social profiles. Becoming part of a community (or the leader of one) or building a loyal customer base doesn't happen overnight. And particularly online, people don't expect to be talked at or imposed upon. We all need to earn our places and prove our value. 

If you're starting a business, when you have great interactions with people who become fans, ask for testimonials you can showcase. If potential customers have trouble, ask what went wrong and how you can improve the experience. If you're fortunate, they will become better evangelists for you than you can ever be for yourself.


## Create great content

When you do get people interested in who you are and what you do, make sure to keep them interested when they come to check you out. Recall the answers you decided on about what you want to build. You need to have a site that welcomes visitors, tells them what they want to know, and encourages them to stay. That could include great blog posts/articles, sharing of practical information, or a user-friendly store offering great stuff.

Your own site is only one part of showing who you are and what you can do online, but it is a big part, and it's a part over which you have full control. (Unlike third-party sites/communities or social media.)

Conveniently, this is also one of the best SEO approaches as well. There is no button to click or form on which to submit your site to get great results in Google and other searches. But creating great content and building a site that people like using and coming back to will help you rise in the rankings.

Ultimately, there's no ideal solution for building an online presence, audience, or community that doesn't require time, hard work, and paying attention to the world around you. But putting in the effort _will_ pay off. No one owes you their attention online, so remembering how you like to experience sites and interact with people and doing your best to replicate and improve upon that is a great set of first steps. [And, of course, registering a great domain name.](https://iwantmyname.com/)
