Email forwarding is one of those things you don't think about, but can vastly improve the way you interact with your mail. As they say, it allows you to "separate where you read your email from your email identity. Forwarding takes mail sent to one address, and redirects it to another, without the sender having to know." 

[Pobox](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/pobox-mail-forwarding) puts out a really nice product, and even if you don't think you need it, you should check them out. Because they absolutely love email—and because it's Valentine's Day, their favorite holiday.
