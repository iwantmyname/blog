title: 7 new domain extensions are coming THIS WEEK
----

<!-- excerpt -->

People of the internet, the new [gTLDs](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425299-what-is-a-gtld-) are finally coming. Not theoretically in a few months either—on **February 5, 2014, 16:00:00 UTC**, people everywhere will be able to purchase these new TLDs just as they would a .COM domain. 

The whole naming convention of the internet is changing, and you can be amongst the first early adopters with one of these domain extensions:

+ [.BIKE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike) for $39 USD / $49 NZD
+ [.CLOTHING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clothing) for $39 USD / $49 NZD
+ [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru) for $39 USD / $49 NZD
+ [.HOLDINGS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-holdings) for $69 USD / $79 NZD
+ [.PLUMBING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-plumbing) for $39 USD / $49 NZD
+ [.SINGLES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-singles) for $39 USD / $49 NZD
+ [.VENTURES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-ventures) for $69 USD / $79 NZD

Pre-orders are still open, so if there's a specific domain you're after, now would be the time to get it in. Once they are open for general availability, the more generic terms are going to go fast.
