There are domain registries, and there are domain registries with ambitious founders located in the Cayman Islands. Much to the enjoyment of the likely tan staff at [Uniregistry](http://uniregistry.com/), they are in the latter.

Launched to the public in 2014, Uniregistry has seven domain extensions coming out this year, including [.LINK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link), [.GIFT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gift) (offered by Dot Gift, LLC), [.GUITARS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guitars), [.PICS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pics), [.PHOTO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photo), and two that were just released yesterday—[.SEXY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-sexy) and [.TATTOO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tattoo).

Unlike many of the fairly conservative gTLDs that have been released thus far, .SEXY and .TATTOO represent edgy fun, giving an alternative crowd some gTLD to latch onto. So we decided to ask Frank Schilling, Founder and Managing Director of Uniregistry, a few questions about how it's all going.

**If you were a fortune teller and I came to you asking about .TATTOO and .SEXY, what would you tell me? Long, happy life? Fast growth? What does the future hold?**

LOL. I honestly think .TATTOO and .SEXY will be a lot like me. Slow start. Late bloomer. Big success in later years. These strings are low priced, have high registrar margins and tons of natural affinity. I think they are long-term niches that won’t go away.

**.TATTOO already has a built-in marketplace, but .SEXY seems to be open to interpretation. What kinds of sites do you see popping up with .SEXY domains?**

Very good question. I think it’s the ultimate discrete adult fashion [domain]. People will find ways to interpret where that takes them. If I were a model or a dancer or an entertainer, .SEXY is delightfully benign and leaves just enough to the imagination.

**Speaking of the .TATTOO marketplace, it's always interesting to hear about people's apprehension to stray from .COM. Do you foresee any issues with getting tattoo shops to make the leap?**

No—none at all. There is safety in numbers and with so many new extensions coming we’re in good shape from an acceptability standpoint.

**From a marketing prospective, how are you getting .SEXY and .TATTOO in front of your future customers? It seems that tech-centric gTLDs are doing alright because their audience is up on the gTLD namespace expansion, but what about the non-tech crowd?**

We're going to rely on our registrar partners to suggest our names as viable alternatives—and we have our own registrar and direct marketing for that beginning March 8th. I definitely view this as a marathon.

**Tell us a bit about Uniregistry itself. Many people probably think you all just sit on gorgeous Cayman Island beaches all day, but your job page has openings for software developers, systems specialists and marketing people. What's day to day life like at Uniregistry? And what kinds of things are you working on?**

There’s a beach here??!

The biggest thing we’ve been working on is our registrar and registries.  It has been a ton of work and will be a mature product this year. We’re developing interesting ways to deliver domains to consumers...its work. But we feel confident we’re on the right track.

**And one last question.** 

**You have some very user-friendly policies like no restore fees, a long restore period and no priority access phases. We dig this a lot at iwantmyname! What made you decide to not join the dark side of the registry force?**

I remember what it was like to be a registrant. We want our spaces to be easy to use, easy to develop and easy to trade with hands-off governance of registrants. We want our registrants to thrive here. There will be bumps along the way as we’re new at this, but I’m confident we’ll get there.
