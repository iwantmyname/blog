title: New gTLDs are a feast for photographers and visual artists

---

<!-- excerpt -->

![Photographer]({{ site.images_url }}/2014-02-12-photographer.jpg)

If you scan through [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) or [Designspiration](http://designspiration.net/) for any period of time, you'll quickly discover hundreds, if not thousands, of artists and photographers with personal websites ending in .com. And that's fine. Seriously. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a .com name. 

But how nice would it be to be able to count on a your photographer having a domain that ends with .photography? Or your camera shop ending in .camera? And for the artists and suppliers themselves, wouldn't a more direct name in a less crowded namespace than .com make sense? Do you really want to get stuck with a 3-5 word domain name, or a domain that very loosely pertains to your branding?

If not, there's a new batch of [gTLD](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/1425299-what-is-a-gtld-) just for you, all coming February 12th at 16:00:00 UTC (pre-orders are still open, but only for a short time!):

### [.PHOTOGRAPHY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography)

There's never been a better showcase for photography than the internet, and there are countless domains out there that follow the YOURNAMEphotography.com naming convention. So why not cut the excess and move to a YOURNAME.photography domain? And since everyone knows you're a photographer anyway, finding you in the .photography namespace (as opposed to guessing between .com and various ccTLDs) will be easier than ever.

### [.GALLERY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-gallery)

For owners of the physical spaces that house photography, no TLD makes more sense than .gallery. Just like .photography, it's an easy way to shorten a lengthy YOURNAMEgallery.com domain name, and it does wonders in keeping people from guessing between TLDs that don't pertain to your brand.

### [.GRAPHICS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-graphics)

.graphics is less of a direct namespace replacement as .photography, but we've still seen quite a few pre-orders get creative with their branding. As you can expect, there are plenty of YOURNAME.graphics names, but there are also some pertaining to shirt designs, deck graphics and trendy styles.

### [.CAMERA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-camera), [.EQUIPMENT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-equipment) and [.LIGHTING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-lighting)

On the flip-side of photography, there are a number of websites dedicated to the gear. The cameras, the equipment and the lighting. And again, how much nicer would the web be if you could count on your camera shop to end in .camera, you lighting specialist to end in .LIGHTING and your equipment dealer to end in .EQUIPMENT?
