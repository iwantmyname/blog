<!-- excerpt -->

It's hard to clearly identify what makes a site special, but one thing that certainly helps is interesting photography. Big images. Graphics that aren't bound to little corners of posts, but are given room to breathe.

But to get good stuff, you have to do it the right way. Yes, I know that dragging images from the web and dropping them into your posts is technically feasible, but without proper attributions and licensing, you're playing on the wrong side of the field.

<!-- /excerpt -->

I'll spare you the legalese here. It comes down to thisâ€”people work really hard to produce quality photography and graphics. So please, don't steal it.

And if you're interested, here are some tips to keep you out of moral grey areas:

1. Paid stock photography doesn't have to suck. Sure, there are thousands of terrible photos of corporate teams high fiving (see above), but sites like [Shutterstock](http://www.shutterstock.com/) and [Bigstock](http://www.bigstockphoto.com/) are filled with millions of great images, vectors and videos, with more added every day. Again, just don't (EVER) use the corporate high five.

2. You can also find free stock photos. Good ones. Here's a great list by Dustin Senos of the [best free stock photo sites](https://medium.com/p/62ae4bcbe01b) he's found (and it looks like he's updating it as he finds more).

3. The [Flickr Creative Commons](http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/) is an awesome tool. Basically, users from all over the world upload photos for public use under the Creative Commons License. Just be sure to follow the rules. And no, adding a little "image from" blurb at the bottom of a post isn't bothersome to readers at all. It just shows you care.

4. Anything is possible if you ask nicely. If you see an image you love online, you can always ask the site owner if you can use it yourself. Yes, they have the right to say no (or not respond at all), but it can't hurt to ask.
