title: Last week in gTLDs, including .WIKI, .XYZ and .TODAY
----

<!-- excerpt -->

Last week's new gTLD launch was an interesting one, with .TECHNOLOGY barely beating out .DIRECTORY and .LAND for weekly launch stat supremacy. This week though we have an eclectic bunch—a few web favorites (.ENTERPRISES and .TIPS), some alternative fun (.TATTOO and .SEXY) and a pair that would fit right into a pirate movie (.DIAMONDS and .VOYAGE).
