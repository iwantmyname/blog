title: Last week in gTLDs, including .WIKI, .XYZ and .TODAY
---

<!-- excerpt -->

Last week's new gTLD launch was an interesting one, with .TECHNOLOGY barely beating out .DIRECTORY and .LAND for weekly launch stat supremacy. This week though we have an eclectic bunchâ€”a few web favorites (.ENTERPRISES and .TIPS), some alternative fun (.TATTOO and .SEXY) and a pair that would fit right into a pirate movie (.DIAMONDS and .VOYAGE).
