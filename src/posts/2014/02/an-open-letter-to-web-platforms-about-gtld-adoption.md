title: An open letter to web platforms about gTLD adoption
---

<!-- excerpt -->

Dear Web Platforms, 

We love you—I love you—but you're making us sad. See, we're currently undergoing the biggest change in domain name history, with [more than 500 gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) coming out in the near future. But without your help, adoption rates will suffer. And if adoption rates suffer, the vast expansion of the internet namespace is all for naught.

<!-- /excerpt -->

### The problem

It started just this week. A support ticket came in saying a customer couldn't get their new gTLD to work in [Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url). Then another in [Shopify](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software). Then another in Google Apps—built by a company that's [bidding to own quite a few gTLDs themselves](http://www.seroundtable.com/google-gtlds-15301.html).

At first, we thought it might be us. Maybe we did something to anger the TLD gods? Fortunately it wasn't a problem on our end—the new gTLDs just weren't registering as actual domain names in various platform dashboards.

In short, it shouldn't be a hard update to make, but keeping up with the pace of the launches is proving to be difficult.

### A solution

Look, we get it. Running our domain registrar is hard work, and I can't really imagine loading up with rapid-fire updates out of left field. So for web platforms and hosted services offering custom domains, I can certainly see how something like this could go unnoticed.

So here's what I can do to help. If you work for a web platform and email me directly at chris at iwantmyname dot com, I'll personally send you a list of the new TLDs being released to the general public the following week. That'll give you time to add them into your system—and will hopefully prevent some support tickets coming your way in the coming months. 

Also, here are some additional resources (the ones we use) for finding out which TLDs exist or are in the pipeline currently:

+ [IANA Root Zone Database](http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db)
+ [ICANN Delegated Strings](http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings)
+ [Mozilla Public Suffix List](http://publicsuffix.org/list/effective_tld_names.dat)

Hope that helps... and thanks for reading!
