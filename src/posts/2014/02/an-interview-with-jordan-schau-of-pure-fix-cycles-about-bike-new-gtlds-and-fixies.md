February 5th marked an important day in domain name history. [Seven new gTLDs were released to the public](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/the-new-domain-extensions-are-here-with-guru-and-bike-leading-the-way.html), including .CLOTHING, .GURU, .HOLDINGS, .SINGLES, .PLUMBING, .VENTURES and .BIKE. As a domain registrar, we have unique insight into gTLD popularity—we have data!—but at the end of the day, we really have no idea how these domains will be used. Will companies completely switch over from .COM? Are these domains being used for fun side projects? We have no idea—so we decided to ask. 

First up, we have Jordan Schau of [Pure Fix Cycles](http://purefixcycles.com/), who is the proud owner of quite a few [.BIKE domains](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bike).

**iwmn:** Hi Jordan, thanks for doing this with us! So first, tell me a bit about yourself, your company and why fixies are so awesome (people should know!).

**Jordan:** Hmm about me, thats a tough one! I’m a tech nerd with a passion for bikes.  I started Pure Fix Cycles with my brother and two best friends right out of college, and the idea was to be a direct-to-consumer offering for stylish and affordable bikes. So thats what we did. Now, we’re in over 500 stores and shipping bikes across the globe - spreading the fixed gear love. 

Why are fixies awesome? Have you seen one!? They’re just those bikes you see that look incredibly cool and require almost no maintenance. They’re also really fun to ride. Sold yet?

**iwmn:** As you know, .BIKE was released to the public on February 5th—and you're now the proud owner of quite a few .BIKE domains. If you don't mind me asking, what are some of your plans for them?

**Jordan:** Well, to be entirely honest, I’m not so sure! Some domains will probably just point to purefixcycles.com like fixedgear.bike and others we’ll do something a bit more fun. One little fun one is [nicks.bike](http://nicks.bike) - thats Nick’s bike!

**iwmn:** Here's the big question. As a small business owner, do you think you'll ever move your company from a .com domain to a .bike domain—or any other generic domain extension for that matter? Is the world ready for that?

**Jordan:** I doubt we’ll ever switch our dot com domains to dot bike domains entirely, but thats not to say they both can't coexist. The simplest way might be having things forward to other domains like we’re doing with fixedgear.bike. If we were to launch something totally new, I wouldn't count out using a fresh new .bike domain. But, I don’t think the mainstream is quite ready to trust .bike domains yet. An example: I told my partner that we got fixedgear.bike and he said “So if we go to fixedgear.bike dot com, that will be us?” People are just so used to .coms that it will be tough to jump ship to .bike.

**iwmn:** There are so many small-business owners looking to create their own sites, but don't even know where to start. But your site really is beautiful. Big images, custom logos, nice typography—how did you build it? And what sort of platform/hosting are you using?

**Jordan:** We use (and love) [Shopify](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/e-commerce/shopify-hosted-online-store-platform-and-shop-software) to host Pure Fix. They’ve been a really great partner for us to work with. We also have an awesome team that helps with everything! 

**iwmn:** So give me the rundown. The city I'm in is flat with good bike lanes and a few great coffee shops and bars to ride to and from. But nothing is super close, so I'd like to go as fast as possible. What's the bike for me?

**Jordan:** The bike for you? I’d say one of our original fixies! I ride a [Whiskey](http://purefixcycles.com/products/whiskey-grey-blue-fixie) to my local cafe in Hollywood all the time and its perfect. If you’re riding to the bar, wear a helmet!
