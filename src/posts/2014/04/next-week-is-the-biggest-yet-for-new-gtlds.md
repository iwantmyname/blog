<!-- excerpt -->

I generally don't like to overhype things, but the sheer volume of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out next week is a big deal. Over the course of three days (April 15-17), 14 domain extensions will be going live, and a few of them are likely to be quite popular.

Here's the full list:

As always, pre-orders will be open until the launch date given, so there's still time to get your domains on the list. Also, in case you missed it [yesterday](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/new-useful-page-the-gtld-launch-calendar.html), we've added a [new page to the site](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates) that lists all the gTLDs with known launch dates and prices. We'll still continue to periodically highlight these gTLDs in the blog, but if you ever need instant information, you now know where to find it.
