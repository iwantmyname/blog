<!-- excerpt -->

No matter where you travel in the world, there's one cultural constant you can always count on—people take their beverages very seriously. Whether it's coffee, beer, wine, vodka or drinks made of animal parts, there's always something you need to try.

And now, with the launch of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), drink makers can tap into this liquid love with domain names categorized for their craft.

<!-- /excerpt -->

###. COFFEE

Quartz posted an eye-opening [article](http://qz.com/166983/where-the-worlds-biggest-coffee-drinkers-live/) (excuse the pun) back in January about coffee consumption around the world—specifically about how much more coffee Northern Europe drinks than the US, UK, France, Spain and Italy. 

As surprising as it was though to find that the Netherlands consumes 2.414 cups of coffee a day (compared to .939 cups in New Zealand and .931 cups in the US), the most interesting stat to me was that people in nearly every country drink coffee daily.

With that in mind, just imagine how many coffee shops there must be. And how many coffee roasters there are delivering beans to markets and restaurants. Now take that one step further and imagine how many coffee-related sites there are on the web. The number must be insane.

Needless to say, the .COFFEE TLD has quite a bit of room to grow. Of the Donuts [mega-list of gTLDs](http://www.donuts.co/tlds/), this one may be the biggest (maybe even bigger than the surprise hit, .GURU?). 

[.COFFEE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee) is now open to the public, so hurry up an grab your domain before someone else does. 

### .BEER and .WINE

Perhaps even more loved than coffee, beer and wine are arguably the most important beverages in human history.

[From Jeffrey Kahn - New York Times:](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/opinion/sunday/how-beer-gave-us-civilization.html)

> Once the effects of these early brews were discovered, the value of beer (as well as wine and other fermented potions) must have become immediately apparent. With the help of the new psychopharmacological brew, humans could quell the angst of defying those herd instincts. Conversations around the campfire, no doubt, took on a new dimension: the painfully shy, their angst suddenly quelled, could now speak their minds.
>
> But the alcohol would have had more far-ranging effects, too, reducing the strong herd instincts to maintain a rigid social structure. In time, humans became more expansive in their thinking, as well as more collaborative and creative. A night of modest tippling may have ushered in these feelings of freedom — though, the morning after, instincts to conform and submit would have kicked back in to restore the social order.

These days, beer and wine serve much the same purpose, and because of their popularity, have developed online ecosystems that go far beyond the major brands. 

Microbreweries, vineyards, distributors, stores, home-brew sites, review blogs and drink-centric magazines—all competing for the same namespaces. We expect to see a number of [.BEER](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-beer) and [.WINE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-wine) domains popping up once the TLDs go live. 

Pre-orders are open now for both domain extensions, and keep checking our [gTLD launch page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates) for upcoming launch details.

### .VODKA

The king of the clears, vodka is the only "hard alcohol" set to launch as a gTLD. And vodka stats are about as unsurprising as they come. 

[From Roberto A Ferdman - Quartz:](http://qz.com/179708/map-where-the-worlds-biggest-vodka-drinkers-are/)

> No one downs vodka like Russia does.
>
> The Russians drink some 17.3 shots of vodka per month on average, according to data from Euromonitor. That’s easily the most in the world. The Polish, the second biggest vodka drinkers in Euromonitor’s sample, throw back about 13.7 shots per month; while Ukrainians drink roughly 10 shots per month. Americans come in at only 3.8.

As popular as vodka is, it'll be interesting to see how its comparatively small ecosystem works out for the .VODKA TLD. Don't be surprised if it's much less popular than the drink TLDs listed above, but that could play into your advantage if you have a great .VODKA domain in mind. [Pre-orders](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-vodka) are open now, and we'll be sure to pass on additional news once launch dates are set.

### The surrounding ecosystem

In a perfect world, these new gTLDs would be used as hard categories for brands to funnel themselves into, but that's probably not a realistic dream. .COM will be a big player for the foreseeable future, country code top-level domains will always be relevant in their respective countries, and even some non-beverage gTLDs will crossover into the space.

For instance, if you were starting a coffee blog, would you go with [.COM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-com), .COFFEE or [.BLOG](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blog)? And would you choose .BEER or [.ORGANIC](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-organic) for an upcoming line of organic beers (yes, they do exist)?

Any way you look at it, these new gTLDs are giving site owners a vast selection of great domains to choose from. So love your beverage sites, and have fun finding the perfect domain for your brand.
