<!-- excerpt -->

Up to now, my main web project has been founding a [social networking site](http://www.paintingsilove.com) for artists to comment on each other’s paintings.  However, I have recently resumed taking black and white street photography after a long break, and I’d like to establish and promote a personal site for my photos.

As mentioned in the iwantmyname [blog](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/04/which-photography-gtld-should-you-use.html), there are a range of different gTLDs to use for photography, including .GALLERY, .PHOTO, .PHOTOS, .PHOTOGRAPHY, .PICS & .PICTURES. When I found that the .PHOTOGRAPHY domain extension was available, I tried to grab street.photography, but it was already taken. So in trying to get something as close/relevant to that as possible, I was able to get streetbw.photography. As I really wanted something starting with just 'street,' I also pre-ordered ‘street’ with some of the other gTLDs, just on the off-chance.

<!-- /excerpt -->

Meanwhile, after using the domain streetbw.photography for a couple of months, I found it quite cumbersome to tell someone verbally, always having to spell it out and explain it. And my wife could never remember it. So after reading the above-mentioned blog entry, it struck me that this domain just wasn’t going to work for me, and I decided to switch to something shorter with my name, such as street.peterorum.com, or even bw.peterorum.com. But luckily, the same day I found that I'd won [street.pics](http://street.pics/), and I was quite excited about it because it’s short, memorable, descriptive and generic. 

For personal photography sites, I think the .PICS and .PHOTOS domains are the way to go. If I had a photography business that needed branding though, I would probably choose .PHOTOGRAPHY with my name, or perhaps with my surname so my first name could be a subdomain, e.g. peter.orum.photography. 

Whichever of the new gTLDs you choose, make sure that the www prefix also works (using a CNAME), as many people still type that in by default, and some editors don't automatically set the straight domain as a link yet.

###Any non-.COM anxiety?

Choosing a non-.COM wasn’t a cause for concern for my personal site. I already have my name, [peterorum.com](http://www.peterorum.com), and other attractive .COM domains are long gone. Discoverability these days is not so much about your domain, but rather having good content, a responsive site for mobile and good promotion. It's also important to get a Google+ profile to link to your site so you are verified as the site author to generate trust. And, for photography, you can promote your work on other sites such as Flickr, Instragram and Twitter, with your site linked through your profile. Because of this visual exposure, an interesting, descriptive, short and memorable domain may be more important than a less memorable one that just aims to show up in Google via domain keywords.

Overall, I’m happy to have street.pics as it seems to suit my purposes best from the available options. Definitely now is the time to be trying to get your first choices, even if it means buying a few and trying them out for a few months until you find the one that works best. Just don’t forget to use the appropriate redirection codes, and notify Google Webmaster Tools if changing so you don’t lose what you have built up.  

Good.luck
