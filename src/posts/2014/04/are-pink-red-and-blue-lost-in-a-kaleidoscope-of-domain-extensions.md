title: Are .PINK, .RED and .BLUE lost in a kaleidoscope of domain extensions?

<!-- excerpt -->

When Afilias announced the start of their [.PINK](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pink), [.RED](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-red) and [.BLUE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blue) sunrise periods, this is how .PINK was positioned ([click over](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/afilias-adds-color-choice-internet-192000232.html) for .BLUE and .RED):

>.PINK addresses embrace a wide range of uses, from the lighthearted fun of baby furnishings and toys to the simmering sensuality of lingerie products to the compassion and courage of cancer caregivers and patients. Young women — and men — of all ages love the optimism of .PINK and can now have a business or personal name that expresses their “pink-itude.” Finally, you can show the world that you “Think .PINK!”

I'm definitely a proponent of the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), but from the start, I wondered how popular color TLDs will be in the long run (the first day was pretty rough). 

<!-- /excerpt -->

Up to now, the vast majority of the gTLDs fit nicely into these three categories:

1. They help you fit in, like .COM. 
2. They align with your brand, like .PHOTOGRAPHY
3. They define you, like .GURU

But .PINK, .RED and .BLUE? Looking at the marketing message above, they don't seem to have a clear definition, and they certainly don't directly categorize many brands (although they'll probably get a few registrations from Victoria's Secret's PINK line). 

As Andrew Allemann of Domain Name Wire [put it](http://domainnamewire.com/2014/04/18/afilias-new-top-level-domain-names-have-very-slow-first-day/), "I would think for one of the color domains to take off they’ll need to get a few key celebrities, star brands, or startups on board. They’ll have to make the domains mean something when they don’t mean much on their own."

One thing I have seen is color TLDs being used for domain hacks—particularly with .RED. A quick search on the [Scrabble Word Finder](http://www.scrabblefinder.com/ends-with/red/) brings up a ton of great ideas, including bo.red, tou.red, admi.red and acqui.red. 

Also, keep in mind that even without a traditional use case, these domain extensions do a lot right:

+ Each are commonly used, easily remembered words 
+ They are short, so you'll likely avoid spelling errors
+ None of these TLDs would ever be confused with another, like .PHOTO and .PHOTOS

So will .PINK, .RED and .BLUE be popular in the long run? I guess we'll see. There's [not much buzz](http://ntldstats.com/tld) around these color TLDs yet, but there's not exactly a time limit for domain extension popularity.
