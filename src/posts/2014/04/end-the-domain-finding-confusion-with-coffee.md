<!-- excerpt -->

This morning I woke up at 7:45 AM and—in zombielike fashion—walked directly to my coffee setup. It was fairly calculated this morning, with 45 grams of a delicious Kenyan roast and 650 grams of 205-degree water poured carefully into my trusty Chemex. 

People close to me think I'm a bit neurotic about my coffee, but it's important to me. It's a hobby, a social scene and something to look forward to every morning—all wrapped up in a warm, brown liquid.

And next week, my hobby and job are colliding. .COFFEE is set to launch on April 9th, and I think a lot of coffee shops, suppliers and blogs would do well to take notice.

### What .COFFEE can do for you

In a perfect world, I wouldn't have to do a Google search every time I wanted to go to a website. For example, one of my favorite roasters is Heart in Portland, OR, but finding the coffee shop/roaster online (without Google) initially took a bit of guesswork. 

I couldn't find the site at heart.com or heartcoffee.com—it took a Google search to find the site at heartroasters.com. Compounding the confusion, similar shops like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia are using the BRANDNAMEcoffee.com naming convention as opposed to BRANDNAMEroasters.com.

Admittedly, I'm so used to searching for things that it doesn't bother me much, but I do miss the days when I could just type in BRANDNAME.com and expect results.

So think of this as a kind of reset for the web. A way for coffee shops with simple words like "Heart" to grab domains I can guess on the first try. 

Doesn't that sound nice?
