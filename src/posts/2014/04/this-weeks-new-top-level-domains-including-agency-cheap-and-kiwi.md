This week in new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) is a strong bunch, including two popular Chinese extensions, some of the "bargain" variety and our local favorite, .KIWI. We have:

+ [.中文网](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91)
+ [.在线](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF)
+ [.BARGAINS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bargains)
+ [.CHEAP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cheap)
+ [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi)
+ [.AGENCY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-agency)

###Hooray for .KIWI!

May 1st is [.KIWI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi) day, and based on the pre-orders, it's looking to be one of the biggest opening days for a gTLD on iwantmyname. If you want to show a little New Zealand love on the web, pre-orders for .KIWI are still open, so get your name on the list before the official launch.


###Big Chinese gTLDs

Being a native English speaker, it's hard for me to estimate the impact of non-Latin gTLDs, but it seems that many of them will do quite well. And yesterday's launch of [.在线](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E5%9C%A8%E7%BA%BF) (translates to .online) and [.中文网](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E7%BD%91) (translates to .chinesewebsite) was the biggest yet, with 33,012 and 17,537 registrations respectively.

From Kevin Murphy - Domain Incite:

>These are still extremely impressive numbers, and .在线 is still the biggest launch to date, surpassing the 31,645 with which .berlin ended its first day of GA a month ago.

>That gTLD is likely to end the day in third or fourth place in the new gTLD league table, depending on how .photography (with 33,489 names this morning) performed today.


###"Discount" domains

I'm sure this will become more clear in the coming months, but I wonder what the public reaction to the "discount" TLDs will be. [.BARGAINS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-bargains) and [.CHEAP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cheap) are coming this week, and they'll be competing with .CODES, .COUPON, .COUPONS, .DEAL, .DEALS and .SALE. I think we'll see one of two things happen:

1. The certain flood of spammy discount sites (there are good ones, just not many) will cause people to reject these gTLDs for trust reasons.
2. There will be so many TLDs in search results that people will just put on blinders and trust search results.

###.COM is soooo 2013

Digital agencies spend vast amounts of time positioning themselves as thought leaders on the web, and judging by our pre-orders, it looks like moving to a [.AGENCY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-agency) domain might be the big agency thought-leadership trend of 2014. 

So I'll end this with a question. Do you want to be the last agency in town with a .COM domain?
