<!-- excerpt -->

I don't think there's any rhyme or reason to it, but it seems like each week's batch of new TLDs has a theme. Two weeks ago we had a group of gTLDs with an [IT theme](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/03/this-week-in-gtlds-is-rigged-up-for-the-it-crowd-plus-some-thoughts-on-email.html). Last week we had a group of education-themed extensions ([.EDUCATION](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-education), [.INSTITUTE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-institute) and [.CAMP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-camp)). 

And this week? I'm calling this the week of cozy spring mornings. We have: 

<!-- /excerpt --> 

+ [.COFFEE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-coffee), to help you wake up and enjoy the crisp, sunny weather
+ [.FLORIST](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-florist), the perfect TLD for finding a bouquet of newly bloomed flowers
+ [.SOLAR](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-solar), for turning the warmth of the sun into energy (to power your coffee grinder, of course)
+ [.HOUSE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-house), the place where all the spring cleaning happens
+ [.INTERNATIONAL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-international), for planning that perfect spring break trip

This is the last day for pre-orders, so get your domain name in before these TLDs go public on April 9th at 16:00 UTC.
