<!-- excerpt -->

If you're not comfortable contacting the domain owner directly, or you tried and didn't get a response, you can attempt to procure the domain when it expires. 

This is anything but a guaranteed strategy, however. Most registrars remind their customers early and often prior to domains expiring. Most registrars also auto-renew domains by default as long as the customer's payment details are accurate and up to date. ([iwantmyname does both of these things for their customers.](http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184422))

Even if a domain's ownership does expire, many registrars give their customers a grace period after expiration so they can still renew it, sometimes at a considerably increased cost. (This pricing is set by the registries, not registrars like iwantmyname.)

<!-- /excerpt -->

You could also try a domain monitoring service, which alerts you to status changes and expirations for your own domains, or others that are of interest to you. Be aware though that this offering can be an upsell attempt by some registrars. (iwantmyname does not offer this service.)

Backordering services are also popular, and if you want a maximum chance of getting the domain if/when it expires, we recommend using all of them. Most of these services will only charge you if they manage to procure the domain, but some charge in advance. Here are a few popular options:

* [NameJet](http://namejet.com)
* [SnapNames](http://snapnames.com)
* [BackorderZone](http://backorderzone.com)
* [Pool.com](http://pool.com)


## Can you make an offer for a domain name for me?

This service is called brokerage, and iwantmyname does not offer any domain brokerage services. We recommend contacting [Sedo](http://www.sedo.com/us/buy-domains/domain-brokerage/) or [DomainAgents](https://domainagents.com/) to assist. 

What brokers will do is contact the domain owner (if they can), then make an offer for the domain for you, handle negotiations, and finalize the agreement to purchase and transfer the domain. You will pay the broker a fee in addition to whatever price you pay for the domain name itself.
