<!-- excerpt -->

December is a bit of a slow month for new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), but the lack of quantity doesn't mean there's a lack of quality. This month, we have a big city launch in .Paris, a surefire hit in the pizza world with .pizza, and some additional TLDs that could be big in business circles. 

Also, with this being the last month of the year, be sure to check out how far the gTLD program has come. In the past year, we've added [247 new domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) to our collection, and will be above the 250 mark by the end of the month. If you're looking to start a new website in 2015, finding a great domain name will be easier than ever—and we're adding new gTLDs nearly every week.
