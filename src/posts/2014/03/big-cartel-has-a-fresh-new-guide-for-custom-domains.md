title: Big Cartel has a fresh new guide to custom domains

----

Here at iwantmyname, we get quite a few questions a day about setting up custom domains on various platforms. And that's quite understandable, because domain mapping is entirely foreign to most people (but is incredibly simple with our [one-click marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services)). 

When we find custom domain guides from web platforms that are clear, informative and easy on the eyes though, we love to point them out as an extra level of assistance in times of need. And today, Big Cartel rolled out a great field guide for custom domains, complete with simple instructions, some nifty explanations and a few solid recommendations for good registrars to go with (we're super happy to be on the list).

[Here's the announcement from the Big Cartel Blog:](http://blog.bigcartel.com/post/80895648068/new-field-guide-custom-domain)

> We’ve launched a new guide to help walk you through the wonderful world of custom URLs. A custom domain takes your brand from yourstore.bigcartel.com to yourstore.com, creates a professional first impression, and is one of the best ways to stake your claim on the internet.
>
> Ready to get started? Our latest field guide will give you specific tips on where to purchase your new domain, and the simplest way to connect it to your Big Cartel shop. All that’s really left is to enjoy the new home that you’ve made for your business.

If you're a Big Cartel user (or thinking about becoming one), check the new guide out [here](http://guides.bigcartel.com/custom-domain/)—it even has some handy tips for "picking a great custom domain."

And thanks for the mention, Big Cartel!

Also worth noting from Big Cartel is their new podcast (well, it's nine-months-old now, but I just discovered it this week), The Art Show. If you're into that sort of thing, [give it a listen](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-art-show/id659177604?mt=2).
