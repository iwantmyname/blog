<!-- excerpt -->

CENTR (Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries) released their latest [DomainWire Stat Report](https://centr.org/system/files/share/domainwire_stat_report_2014_1.pdf) today, delivering a wide range of stats related to ccTLD growth and overall size. Some of the information didn't come as much of a surprise, such as .CN (China) being the fastest-growing ccTLD of the quarter (with 1.3 billion people, you're bound to have some demand), but much of it was quite interesting.

### It's all in a name

When the lines for countries were originally drawn, their corresponding ccTLDs were probably not considered. But how lucky was Montenegro to get stuck with [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro)?

Per 100 people in the country, 114 .ME domain names have been registered. That's more than a domain for every single person in the country. But even that is dwarfed by Liechtenstein's [.LI](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/li-liechtensteiner-domain-name-registration-for-liechtenstein) ccTLD. For every 100 people in Liechtenstein, 173 .LI domains are sold. Only 37,000 people reside in the country, but it's an impressive stat nonetheless.

### Non-Latin characters are being used

> A recent CENTR survey, in which 21 European ccTLDs said they offer IDNs showed that as at December 2013, there were total of 1.2 million domain names in Europe containing at least one non-Latin character - this represents around 6% of the domains in these ccTLDs. Compared to 6 months prior, the number of IDN domains in these ccTLDs grew with 17%. 

Once non-Latin gTLDs start gaining traction, I think site owners will be much more likely to use non-Latin characters all over the web. This 1.2 million domain name stat could be quite a bit higher this time next year.

### Germany leads Europe (and most of the world)

With 15.7 million [.DE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/de-german-domain-name-registration-for-germany) domains, Germany leads all of Europe in ccTLD registrations. The list drops off quickly after Germany though, with .UK having 10.6 million domains and [.NL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands) (Netherlands) having 5.4 million.

But even Germany is dwarfed by the tiny islands of Tokelau and their .TK domain. 22.2 million domains have been registered with the .TK ccTLD, but the vast majority are likely hosted through .TKs free registration service (you can also fully own the domain for [a price](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tk-tokelauan-domain-name-registration-for-tokelau)). Don't get too excited thoughâ€”there are some [strict rules](http://www.dot.tk/en/doc_tcfree_v360.pdf) in place.
