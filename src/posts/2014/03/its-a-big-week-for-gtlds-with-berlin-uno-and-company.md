This week is a big one for the gTLD rollout, with a massive eight new domain extensions to choose from: [.ACADEMY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-academy), [.BERLIN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin), [.CENTER](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-center), [.COMPANY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-company), [.COMPUTER](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-computer), [.MANAGEMENT](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-management), [.SYSTEMS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-systems) and [.UNO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-uno).

### .BERLIN gets the first city TLD

[From BBC News:](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26576617)

> Companies or individuals based in the German capital will be able to use .berlin at the end of their website addresses from 18 March, the [dpa news agency reports](http://archived.link/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/news/wirtschaft/internet-berlin-geht-mit-eigener-staedte-domain-online-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-140314-99-01746). The suffix - technically known as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) - was created under an agreement between Berlin's local government and ICANN, the US-based organisation that co-ordinates global internet systems.
> 
> After Berlin, cities including London, Paris, New York, Johannesburg and Japanese city Nagoya will launch their own domains. The .london suffix will become available in April. A single website with the ending .wien, representing the Austrian capital Vienna, has been live since early March but public registration for that gTLD does not open until July. 

The startup scene in Berlin is one of the best on the planet, so we expect to see quite a few .BERLIN sites around the web in the near future. And [as we've said before](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/ich-bin-ein-berliner.html), the team at [dotBERLIN](http://dotberlin.de/) is one of the true pioneers of the gTLD program, so we wish them all the best.

### .UNO gives the Latin internet a name

[From Desiree Boxberger on the iwantmyname Blog:](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/uno-looks-to-unite-the-spanish-speaking-web-an-interview-with-desiree-boxberger.html)

> .UNO is a new domain with broad appeal and offers substantial cultural and linguistic relevance in both the Spanish and Italian languages. .UNO means "one" but it also means "first," "best," and "unity" when used in context. Our primary market consists of 490 million Spanish-speaking people around the globe.
> 
> .UNO serves to unite Spanish-speakers in one easy-to-remember place and provides a dedicated space to find information, shop and collaborate in their language of choice and comfort. In simple, .UNO = Spanish. 

One of the bigger changes the internet is making right now is to be more inclusive of languages that aren't English. We're seeing Japanese TLDs, Arabic TLDs, and now we're seeing a TLD in the traditional latin alphabet, but geared to a culture that's seeing a massive tech surge. 

Will .UNO be Latin America's .COM catch-all domain? Will it meet .UNO's projected figure of 2 million domains under management by year five? We're can't wait to find out. 

### .COMPANY has some stiff competition

I'll get right to the point. If you had your mind set on grabbing a domain for your company, would you go with .COMPANY over .COM or .CO?

The argument for "yes" is pretty clear, and is directly in line with the gTLD program's basic goalâ€”to give people a useful alternative to .COMs crowded namespace. So in that sense, it works. The namespace will be relatively open, giving brands an open playing field for easily remembered options. 

But with hundreds of new TLDs offering categorical options, plus the existence of the fairly popular .CO TLD (which is still far less saturated than .COM), .COMPANY is going to be in an uphill battle.

### Pre-orders are still open (but not for long)

You still have a bit of time to pre-order a domain for one the eight gTLDs coming out this week. Just head over to the **Coming this week** category on our [new gTLD page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) for the full list.
