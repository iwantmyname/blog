title: Thoughts on the adoption of photography gTLDs

.PHOTOGRAPHY, .PHOTOS, .PHOTO—there are a number of new gTLDs related to photography, but just because something exists doesn't mean it will take off. So we put this up on Twitter hoping for some replies:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Dear internet, &#10;&#10;We&#39;re looking for opinionated iwantmyname users/photographers for a quick email interview. Interested? Tweet us back!</p>&mdash; iwantmyname (@iwantmyname) <a href="https://twitter.com/iwantmyname/statuses/441344749686226944">March 5, 2014</a></blockquote>

And then sent out the following question:

**What do you think about the new photography gTLDs coming out? From a business standpoint, do you think it's wise to grab a .PHOTOGRAPHY or .PHOTOS domain?**

Here's what we got back.

I do like the simplicity of the new gTLDs, however, I'm not fully sold. One thing I've noticed is browsers not fully supporting them. I cannot type vim.sexy (Vim text editor) into a browser without the http://. It just gives me a search engine search. On that same tangent, most commoners of the web don't even look at the domain name. They rarely even type a domain in a complete sense! They'll usually just enter the phrase into Google, or enter the domain into Google and click he first result. A lot of people operate on the belief that all websites are accessed through Google. 

I have few non-standard domains for my area, such as .es or .be, as they work well with my name. I get a lot of confusion from the average person, since typing thewiebes into Google will net far different results than typing thewieb.es. For me, it seems like a new gTLD is a great way to protect your brand, but not absolutely essential.

All the new TLDs coming out are going to result in an explosion of new creative ways for people and companies to express themselves.The .photos or .photo are a great opportunity for photographers. I think certain very touristy locations for photos could capitalize on these domains. The .photography domain sounds a bit of a stretch since the average length of a normal domain is 11 characters. Since the .photography domain *is* 11 characters, the length scares me off a bit.

From a business standpoint there are pros and cons with the new gTLDs. If you're heavily invested in a business brand, grabbing the gTLDs is essential to ensure that hard work doesn't get ruined by a poacher.

Other than that you really have to look at why you would purchase the new gTLD. Predominantly you want to generate revenue from your websites. This is done by things like search engine referrals or word of mouth.

Search Engines: It is yet to be seen how much emphasis search engines will place on these new gTLDs. Will spammers do what they usually do and ruin the fun for everyone? Will Google treat all gTLDs with caution until they can be trusted? We currently don't have much info on that, so there's definitely an element of the unknown. 

Word of Mouth: Word of mouth is interesting. The "average joe" equates websites with .com or local ccTLDs. It will take some time for this mindset to change; if it's going to at all. If it does and you get into a conversation with somebody, they might pull out their phone to look at your website. Then you have to wait even longer for them to type .PHOTOGRAPHY instead of .COM - frustrating. There is a reason why KISS works.

With just those two points, personally I would only be registering a gTLD from a vanity point of view. I am quite vain, so you may see my buying one in the future.

I'm super into the new TLDs, but I'm not sure how many photographers will really bite just yet. Lots of parked domains and forwarding if anything. I might grab .photos though.

Potentially - although it's expensive and might confuse some people who aren’t familiar with the concept of the new long TLDs. So I wouldn’t want to rely solely on a gTLD to start with.
