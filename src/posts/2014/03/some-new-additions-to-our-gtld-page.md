title: Some new additions to our gTLD page

There are 499 new generic Top-Level Domains currently sitting in our list. 499â€”a ton of domain extensions just waiting to be discovered. But categorizing them all and breaking them into useful lists is quite a chore.

In the beginning, we simply parsed them out into categories and left it at that. For a time, it was a great way to discover new gTLDs like .SHOP and .BEER, but once the launches came though it became a mess of pre-orders and launched domains.

<!-- /excerpt -->

So last night, we added some new categories to make [the new gTLD page](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) a bit more useful:

+ **Available to register** - Looking for a list of the gTLDs you can buy today? This is the page for you.
+ **Launched this week**
+ **Coming next week**

Hope this helps! And keep tuning back in the coming weeks and months for more useful changes and additional gTLD information.
