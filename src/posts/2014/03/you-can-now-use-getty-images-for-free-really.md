We [wrote a bit about using stock photography](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/02/need-images-for-your-site-here-are-some-tips-for-doing-it-right-tip-1-never-use-the-corporate-high-five.html) a few weeks ago, but today we found some news that might change everything.

<!-- /excerpt -->

[From Russell Brandom - The Verge:](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use)

>If you go to the Getty Images website, you'll see millions of images, all watermarked. There are more than a hundred years of photography here, from FDR on the campaign trail to last Sunday's Oscars, all stamped with the same transparent square placard reminding you that you don't own the rights. If you want Getty to take off the watermark, you'll have to pay for it.

>Starting now, that's going to change. Getty Images is dropping the watermark for the bulk of its collection, in exchange for an open-embed program that will let users drop in any image they want, as long as the service gets to append a footer at the bottom of the picture with a credit and link to the licensing page. For a small-scale Wordpress blog with no photo budget, this looks an awful lot like free stock imagery.

Free. Stock. Imagery. And not just free stock imageryâ€”this is free stock imagery from [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/).

Anyways, I definitely recommend reading through the full article above if you're interested in how this transition will all play out. It's a really big deal, and will hopefully go a long way towards making the web a more visually appealing place.
