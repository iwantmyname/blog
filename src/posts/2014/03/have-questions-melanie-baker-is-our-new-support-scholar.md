title: Have questions? Melanie Baker is our new support scholar

First, some math. A good portion of our business comes from good-ol' North America, which creates a huge problem for us—timely time-zone support coverage. In short, we're in NZDT (UTC+13), while New York is in EST (UTC-5). 13--(+)5=18. 

So when the North American East coast is looking to get their day started around 9am, it's still 3am in Wellington. And by the time "the tireds" have worn off (around 11am), much of the North American east coast is packing up to go home.

Basically, for us to hire a "Support Scholar," we had to find an agile, patient, independent, funny, intelligent master of clearly crafting the English language—who lives in North America. 

Meet Melanie.

Melanie (Melle for short) is a busy individual in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada (EST, UTC-5!!!). She's big in the local startup scene, organizes both the [Waterloo Girl Geek Dinners](http://www.girlgeekskw.com/) and [Speakeasy Tales](http://www.thespeakeasylive.com/) (and Ales... her love of craft beer was a big plus), and has helped build and support communities for big companies you've heard of.

And if you need a "taste" of her support style, here's a short talk she gave about how to survive a zombie apocalypse (tons of useful information).

So if you're feeling kind, send her a [support ticket](https://iwantmyname.com/support) and say hi. We're quite happy to have her on board.
