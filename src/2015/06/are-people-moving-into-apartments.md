Apartments will never go out of style. They're the cogs that keep low-density cities moving—an affordable option for those who don't need the space a house provides. But what can you do with a [.APARTMENTS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-apartments) domain? It's not a job title, personal identifier, or generic business category. Apartments are simply a type of higher-density housing unit, making the TLD a specialized option to the extreme.

### .APARTMENTS are for apartments

Even though apartment complexes are all unique entities, apartment naming isn't exactly an exercise in high creativity. In [Apartment Guide's analysis](http://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/apartment-names/) of the community names in their system, they found more than a thousand complexes using the word "Park" and "Village." And nearly as many use words like "Place," "Creek," Ridge," and "Square." That's a lot of redundancy, and on a namespace like .COM, you're looking at a lot of varied domains using words like "apartments," "community," and "apts" to separate themselves from unrelated companies using similar naming structures.

With .APARTMENTS, builders can simply use "name.APARTMENTS," leaving out the identifiers needed in crowded, generic namespaces. Some creativity may come into play if 200 different "Village Pointe" apartments try to go after the same domain name, but at least the naming competition will be kept within the industry—not the world at large.

### Will that be enough?

At the end of the day, each of these new generic TLDs is a business. Some, like [.CLUB](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) and [.XYZ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz) seem to have a bright future due to their mass appeal. But others, like .APARTMENTS, are really going to have to fight to capture their niche audience. The underlying registry, Donuts, has hundreds of TLDs in their portfolio though, so it wouldn't surprise me at all to see a major ad push for extensions like [.GURU](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru), [.PHOTOGRAPHY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-photography), and the aforementioned .APARTMENTS in the future. And who knows, maybe your .APARTMENTS domain will get featured!
