<!-- excerpt -->

Thousands upon thousands of websites are created every day. New brands. New blogs. Social platforms, online portfolios, e-commerce sites. And really, there's very little in common amongst the sites. Some will be responsive, some will have traditional layouts, some will have non-traditional layouts—but nearly all of them will have a logo. 

The logo. It's the first thing people see when they visit your site, but it's often the last thing people think about when starting out. So let's unlock some of the mystery behind the logo building process and figure out how you can get a logo you'll be proud of.

<h2 id="section-1">Why a logo is important</h2>

[From Jacob Cass, Smashing Magazine: ](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/26/vital-tips-for-effective-logo-design/)

> To understand what a logo is, we first must understand what the main purpose of logos is. The design process must aim to make the logo immediately recognizable, inspiring trust, admiration, loyalty and an implied superiority. The logo is one aspect of a company’s commercial brand or economic entity, and its shapes, colors, fonts, and images usually are strikingly different from other logo in the same market niche. Logos are used to identify.
> 
> Paul Rand, one of the world’s greatest designers states that “a logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. A logo does not sell (directly), it identifies. A logo is rarely a description of a business. A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around.”

Let's unpack that a bit. The logo, as stated above, is your brand's signature. That brand could be you and your personal thoughts (a personal blog), a collection of many thoughts (a company website or group blog), or just a digital space for your physical entity (like a menu/information site for a restaurant)—no matter what it is, it's your logo that will be front and center on your site (or maybe in the top left). And as Paul Rand says, your logo doesn't have to be a description of your business—it doesn't have to tell an epic at first glance—but it should give some meaning to what you're up to. Does your logo [inspire motion](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671067/the-story-behind-the-famous-fedex-logo-and-why-it-works)? Whimsy? A rigid but formidable structure? Or the worst, a trend that died off years ago?

These things matter. Maybe not as much as the quality of whatever you're building, but people do notice.
    
<h2 id="section-2">How a logo fits into your branding</h2>

When a logo matters most is when it comes to branding, and branding is *everywhere* these days. Just think about it—instead of just seeing logos on physical goods and locations, then on the occasional website, you now see logos on Twitter handles, Facebook posts, Instagram shots, app icons, and emails. Branding is all over the internet, and if your logo doesn't look good in any space, on any size, your brand is probably missing the mark (and giving your discerning customers a bad taste in their mouths).

Here's a little nugget from someone who was consistently ahead of the curve. 

{{ template "youtube" "xb8idEf-Iak" }}

> Every once in a while a company has a logo that's a little jewel, a symbol, that can be used independently of the logotype. At Apple we had such a symbol, as a matter of fact, at Apple, the symbol was the name of the company. It was a thing that had the same name as the company—an apple. Our challenge was that it usually takes ten years and a hundred million dollars to associate a symbol with the name of the company. Our challenge was, how can we have a little jewel that we could use without the name to put on the product without spending ten years and a hundred million dollars to make that association in a customer's mind. And Paul solved that by making a little jewel that contained in it the name of the company. And I think he really approached it as a problem that needed to be solved, rather than an artistic challenge for his own sake. 

Today, that little jewel is so critical—it's what's going to fit in your square Twitter profile pic. It's what's going to fit cleanly on a mobile site without hogging too much screen real estate. And if you happen to see that logo in the wild, it's what's going to give your potential customers an instant reminder of what you're all about. 

[Here's a bit from Richard Feloni of Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-makes-the-best-logos-so-good-2014-4) on how logos are changing because people are just now realizing the need for adaptability:
 
> When tackling a branding project, Mathews differentiates between the "true and new." She says a logo needs to be "true," in the sense that it should not be fundamentally tied to a trend, the "new." The trendiness is more appropriate in supporting elements of branding, like store experiences or website interfaces. That said, a logo should be fundamentally sound but also be adaptable to the ways it will be presented.
> 
> "Logos used to have to be recognizable down to the size that they would be represented on a business card. Now they have to work at much smaller sizes, because they'll be seen on mobile screens," Mathews said. That's actually the reason why so many logos have become "flatter," in the sense that they've been stripped of techniques like shadowing that add a dimension of depth or movement.

<h2 id="section-3">What it takes to design a logo</h2>

With all that adaptability in mind, it's important to know what it takes to create a logo that works. Aaron Draplin, one of the most well-known logo designers today, made a great video on his process, and a bit of the thinking that goes behind logo creation. 

{{ template "vimeo" "113751583" }}

> It's one thing to design that logo, and just have it floating on this PDF, and you're sort of drunk on white space and negative space and just floating, but rarely will you see it that way. The way you see it will be on some stupid little Instagram in the corner, or on a guy's business card, or embroidered on his sweatshirt or something. 

This was a rush job from one of the better designers out there, but if you want a *good* logo, it's probably going to take a bit of time, some honest critical thinking, and possibly a bit of money. (In short, you should be wary of any company offering you a quick logo for cheap. You might end up getting something wonderful, but most likely you're going to get something that doesn't capture the soul of your brand, and will probably look dated in a couple of years.)

<h2 id="section-4">Logo options for different budgets</h2>

Time and effort aside, does it cost thousands, or millions, of dollars to get a good logo? Nope. [From HUH., in an article titled "The Cost Of A Logo":](http://www.huhmagazine.co.uk/4140/the-cost-of-a-logo)

> In 2001, oil giant BP commissioned creative agency Landor Associates, advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather and the PR consultants Ogilvy PR to replace their "Green Shield" logo with the current Helios symbol and create a surrounding identity and campaign. Designed in a green and yellow sunflower pattern, the logo represents energy in its many forms and comes with the tagline "Beyond Petroleum". The cost of this re-branding procedure? A mere $211 million USD…

On the flipside, Google went a different route:

> Despite arguably being the most recognisable logo in the Western world, the Google logo cost the Internet company exactly $0 to create. It was actually designed in 1998 by co-founder Sergey Brin and, although it's obviously been tuned up a little since then, the main elements still remain.

Good logos can come from anywhere, and can be made by anyone. Expectations are important though. While Google did indeed create an iconic logo on the cheap, the company started in the early days of the internet when sites typically looked terrible. User expectations of website designs were initially quite low, and the Google logo has been polished, repolished, and probably repolished again between then and now to make up for it. If you're going to go the route of creating your own logo or going with something inexpensive, don't get stuck. Your brand is always evolving, and your logo can, and should, evolve with it (unless you strike gold with a cheap logo like Nike or Coca-Cola).

Here are a few directions you could go when looking to get a logo built:

+ Have some design skills? Pull up Adobe Illustrator, or your app of choice, and start creating. (You can also use free tools like [Squarespace's logo creator](http://squarespace.com/logo), but know that your options will be limited.)
+ Know a designer? Figure out a budget and ask if they'll help you out. (A budget is important, even if it's small... if you value someone's work, you should pay them.)
+ Try a site like [99designs](http://99designs.com) or [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design/creative-logo-design/#layout=auto&page=1). If anything, getting an inexpensive logo made will set you on the right track, giving you something you can evolve as your brand does.
+ Find a local branding shop. Anyone good will charge $100+/hr (rough estimate), but with a branding shop, you'll get someone who will give your brand some real attention.

No matter what you get, there is one important thing to be mindful of. Be consistent. Sure, you can make changes to your logo over time, but you need to be consistent with it across the board. Your site logo needs to pair with your Twitter logo, and your font can't be Helvetica in one place, and then Arial on another. 

Here's a designer's worst nightmare, [from Logo Psych:](http://logopsych.com/2013/01/13/small-business-logo-commitment/#more-60)

> I knew he probably didn’t have much of a budget to hire me (or anyone else) to design a logo from scratch so I did the best I could and offered him some free advice. I told him NOT to do what the previous owners of Dexter’s did. Dexter’s had a terrible brand consistency problem. Their front sign, side sign, business cards and website all displayed a different style of what might be called Dexter’s logo. Their card had a silhouette of a coffee mug with the handle turned into a Helvetica D with the rest of the word following in Helvetica. It wasn’t great, but not too terrible either. It could have been an effective logo if they’d just had a sense of COMMITMENT to that single logo. Their front signage had their name in something similar to Baskerville, a serifed “classic” typeface. The sign on the side of the building was something different, and their website logo I believe was set in Times New Roman. Absolutely no consistency.

No matter what you go with, make sure you use your logo consistently. It matters.

<h2 id="section-5">What to look for when choosing from options</h2>

Unless you're going with someone like Paul Rand, who famously only provided a single logo option to his clients, you'll probably be presented with a few variations. How do you choose between them? 

First, [from Peter Shadbolt, BBC:](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32495854)

> If you are presented with a design for your company logo that is immediately likeable and resonates with your values, you might be wise to take a long hard look at it, bin it, and start again.
> 
> That's the opinion of Sagi Haviv, partner at New York graphic design firm Chermayeff & Geismer & Haviv (CGH).
> 
> "It's never love at first sight," he says. "A good logo, a good trademark, gains meaning and power over time."

Before you slide into melancholy, the key thing to know is that picking the right logo takes time. Just like when choosing a house, a car, or a pair of jeans, you have to put stock into all the options. You might love something immediately, but give every option some thought, and really try to see the value in everything you're given. Subtlety can take time to digest.

As a thought-starter, here's [David Airey, on the important design elements of brand identities:](http://www.davidairey.com/what-makes-a-good-logo/)

> My good friend Lee Newham taught me about five important design elements when it comes to brand identities. Iconic logos are:
> 
+ Describable
+ Memorable
+ Effective without colour
+ Scalable i.e. work when just an inch in size
+ Relevant to the industry in question

Like most things in life, just know that there's never *ever* **ever** going to be a perfect option. If you're an observant human, you'll probably be able to find fault in anything. But as Paul Rand said at the beginning "a logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around." A great logo won't make a bad brand good, and a bad logo can always be made better, as long as the brand can prop it up. 

Be brave! Make a decision and stick with it (for a while at least)! And don't stagnate. Stagnation is probably the worst thing for your brand.
