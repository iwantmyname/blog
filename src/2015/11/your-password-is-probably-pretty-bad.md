title: Your password is probably pretty bad

[Tom Simonite on why current password advice is misleading:](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/542576/youve-been-misled-about-what-makes-a-good-password/)

> “Password must include upper and lowercase letters, and at least one numeric character.” A common scold dished out by websites or software when you open an account or change a password—and one that new research suggests is misleading.
> 
> A study that tested state-of-the-art password-guessing techniques found that requiring numbers and uppercase characters in passwords doesn’t do much to make them stronger. Making a password longer or including symbols was much more effective.

In 2015, "password" is just slightly worse than "Password1". Maybe try something like "I hate typing in passwords!" (or start using a tool like [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)).
