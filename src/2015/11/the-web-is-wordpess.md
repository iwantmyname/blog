[Emil Protalinski on WordPress powering a quarter of the internet:](http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/wordpress-now-powers-25-of-the-web/)

> Today is a big day for the free and open-source content management system (CMS). To be perfectly clear, the milestone figure doesn’t represent a fraction of all websites that have a CMS: WordPress now powers 25 percent of the Web.
> 
> The latest data comes from W3Techs, which measures both usage and market share: “WordPress is used by 58.7% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is 25.0% of all websites.” While these numbers naturally fluctuate over the course of the month, the general trend for WordPress has been slow but steady growth.

Nothing against WordPress, but I'm surprised they've remained so huge with so many (quite good) competitors in the space.
