title: What does your workplace attire say about you?

[Steve Sammartino on workplace attire:](https://startupblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/the-secret-truth-about-what-we-wear-to-work/)

> We all wear uniforms to work, even when we are not in the Army. Sometimes it’s subtle, sometimes it’s overt, but it always says much about hierarchy and whether we follow rules. The stricter the uniform, the stronger the hierarchy. Organisations with an informal, yet ‘expected uniform’ have less freeform thinking, and a culture of rule followers. Just take a look around this week at what people wear – from McDonalds, to bank tellers, to politicians, to creative types and you’ll see their culture on display.

> We can use our uniform to immediate advantage. Often the decision is as simple as do we want to fit in this time, or stand out on purpose?
