title: November is a big month for Startup Weekend (here and abroad)
excerpt: false
----

Growing an entrepreneurial culture globally is perhaps the most effective tool for driving economic growth that delivers real benefits to a wide cross-section of the community. With [Global Entrepreneurship Week](http://wearegen.co/gew/host-countries-prepare-global-entrepreneurship-week) almost upon us, we've been playing a key role in entrepreneurial activism locally.

Startup New Zealand is leading the charge here at home by helping to facilitate Startup Weekend events, connecting people, and sharing the good oil. We've been on board with Startup Weekends from day one with sponsorship cash, management support, and mentorship. It's also been a wonderful vehicle for us to connect to techies, designers, and business thinkers, many of whom have become friends.

So November is an exciting month for us, with a bunch of Startup Weekends scheduled all over New Zealand. We plan to get to as many as possible and will be shouting a few beers and giving away swag. But we are also spreading our wings offshore. 

We are backing Bali Startup Weekend, an event that last year launched several companies and garnered an [honourable mention in the Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/11/17/5-startup-ideas-born-in-bali-in-one-weekend/). The Bali event will be held at Hubud, a co-working space dear to our hearts after we spent some time [soaking up the tropical heat there ourselves](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/11/bali-trip.html) last year. Hubud is rapidly becoming the epicentre for digital nomadic lifestyle and startup culture within South-East Asia.

Wherever you are based, make sure you check out [Startup Weekends](https://startupweekend.org). Apart from being a lot of fun, it's a great way to meet potential co-founders, learn about lean startup methodologies, and test ideas in a safe environment.
