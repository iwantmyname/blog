title: Asking for spec work is ridiculous
excerpt: false

[Anne Quito on spec work:](http://qz.com/543643/its-time-to-stop-asking-creatives-to-work-for-free/)

> In fact, it’s an insidiously common practice to ask creative professionals to spend hours creating original custom work for free (called “spec work”), before they’re actually hired.
> 
> Speculative work, also referred to as “sample creative” is part of the bidding process for many projects. It’s often formally stipulated in the open calls issued by governments and big multilateral organizations, and casually brought up in prospective client meetings. But doing spec work is enormously expensive for creative agencies and artists, who must divert resources from existing clients in the hopes of winning new business.

> [A new short film by Canadian advertising agency Zulu Alpha Kilo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=essNmNOrQto) hilariously captures how absurd a spec work request sounds in other contexts.

1. The #saynotospec video (linked above) is amazing. 
2. If you're in charge of getting creative work done for your company or project, don't ask people to do spec work. Just find a person or agency you want to work with and go from there. As someone who's been tasked with doing a fair amount of spec work in previous jobs, it's a fairly insulting way to spend your time.
