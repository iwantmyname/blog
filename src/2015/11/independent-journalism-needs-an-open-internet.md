[John West on the death of the open web:](http://qz.com/545048/death-by-a-thousand-likes-how-facebook-and-twitter-are-killing-the-open-web/) 

> Here’s one way to understand the symbiotic relationship between publications and platforms in the digital age. Publications depend on advertising dollars to keep producing content, so they need to hold readers’ attention. Big platforms like Facebook and Twitter already have plenty of attention, but they need vast quantities of content to fill up their newsfeeds. It seems natural, then, that publications have started relying on platforms to drive readership.

> But there’s a hitch: This is a really depressing, dystopian way to think about publishers and platforms. It only really makes sense if you view writing as a fungible commodity and view the world exclusively through the lens of late–stage capitalism. The worst thing about Facebook—and Twitter and Snapchat and every other god in the pantheon of platforms—is that they probably do think about publishers this way. And that’s going to smother journalistic independence and the open web.

I was listening to the latest episode of [On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/optimistic-look-newspaper-business/) today, and David Chavern, the new president and CEO of the Newspaper Association of America, said something to the effect of, "Google needs newspapers for content, and newspapers need Google for pageviews. And it's not like Google has time to interview the Mayor."

But what happens when Google (or Facebook, or Twitter, etc.) decides they do have the time? Are we ok with a world where closed platforms monopolize the distribution of news? Can "independent" tech news, for example, survive when it's entirely distributed on the platforms it's writing about?
