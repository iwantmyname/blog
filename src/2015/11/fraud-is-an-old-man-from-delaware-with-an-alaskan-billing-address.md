[Sarah Beldo at Sift Science with some great stats on fraud:](http://blog.siftscience.com/blog/2015/how-fraudulent-users-slip-under-the-radar)

> The Fraudiest Person in America is...
> 
+ Male. Men are slightly more likely than women to be fraudsters
+ (Perhaps pretending to be) elderly. The 85-90 age range has the highest fraud rate. Users identifying themselves as this age are 2.5x more likely to be fraudsters than the average user
+ Buying something cheap. Orders worth $0-$20 have the highest fraud rate. Purchasing something worth $20 or less makes someone 2.16x more likely to be a fraudster.
+ Shipping something to Delaware. In our geographic analysis, the second smallest state in the U.S. had the highest fraud rate based on shipping address.
+ Billing something to a credit card in Alaska. We found that the largest state in the union – and the state listed first in checkout form dropdown lists – had the highest fraud rate based on billing address.

We have a special place in our hearts for our lovely fraudsters.
