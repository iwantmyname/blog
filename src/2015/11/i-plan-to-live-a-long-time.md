[Nicholas Bakalar on coffee reducing my risk of death by 6-15%:](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/coffee-tied-to-lower-risk-of-dying/?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email&_r=1&mtrref=undefined&gwh=6DBBED93DDD1953EA990CB3942CDFC43&gwt=pay)

> Compared with abstainers, nonsmokers who drank a cup of coffee a day had a 6 percent reduced risk of death, one to three cups an 8 percent reduced risk, three to five cups a 15 percent reduced risk, and more than five cups a 12 percent reduced risk. There was little difference whether they drank caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee. The association persisted after controlling for age, alcohol consumption, B.M.I. and other health and diet factors.
> 
> Coffee drinking was linked to a reduced risk of death from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neurological diseases and suicide, although not from cancer.
