[The Washingtonian on "why open offices are terrible":](http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/work-education/why-open-offices-are-terrible/index.php)

> Walls are so 20th-century. According to a 2010 study by the International Facility Management Association (IFMA), 70 percent of Americans now conduct their working lives in open offices, where (so goes the script) the absence of physical barriers is a boon for communication, knowledge-sharing, and productivity. Or is it? Hereâ€™s what the data says.

Hint: The data says open offices should close up shop.

Mildly related, I wonder if these same sick-day/productivity/happiness stats carry over to working primarily in places like coffee shops that are very open, often noisy, and only sell beverages that make people need to pee.
