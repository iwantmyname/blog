[From Steve Benjamins - Site Builder Report:](http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/blog/what-happened-to-virb-after-godaddy-acquired-it)

> The culture at Virb began to shift after the GoDaddy acquisition. There were now new bosses and new goals— but not ones that aligned with Virb’s original vision. The 4 original Virb team members decided it was time to leave.
> 
> “It was clear to me that our new leadership wanted to extract as much money from our customers as possible.” Ryan Clark, Virb’s Product Manager and Creative Director at the time says. “Our new directive was simple: revenue.”
> 
> To make matters worse, the Virb team was denied any resources. After losing the 4 original Virb team members Clark notes, “All of my requests to fill the positions disappeared in the ether of the acquisition. It seemed clear to me that GoDaddy had no intention of backing up their new goals for us with the resources to actually achieve them.”

This isn't so much an indictment of GoDaddy, as they clearly acquired Media Temple to better compete in the web hosting game (Virb just happened to be part of the deal), but it's sad to see a once-promising platform slow to a grind. As a writer who frequently uses all-in-one platforms to get ideas on the web, I've primarily moved on to Squarespace. It's fast enough, beautiful, and best of all, dead simple to use. Hopefully we'll see other hosted, all-in-one solutions take up the torch though—competition in the space is what drives innovation.

As for the future of Virb:

> Hallgren speculates that GoDaddy will let Virb “die a slow death and collect the money being made on it in the meantime.”
> 
> Unfortunately this most effects the 20,000 customers who still rely on Virb to provide a stable, contemporary website— unfortunately, it’s not clear how stable that future is.
