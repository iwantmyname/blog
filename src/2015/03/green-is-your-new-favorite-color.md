As far as colors go, green is a loaded word. It stands for sustainability, political movements, and money. Kermit the Frog feels green. Sick people look a little green. Green is everywhere, and now your favorite color has an online home—[.green](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-green). 

But what should people do with it? Here are some suggestions.

<!-- /excerpt -->

### Political Campaigns

Many countries have a green party, and adding .green to a name, country, or movement slogan could be a nice touch. 

+ name.green
+ country.green
+ vote.green

### Investment Planners

I'd be careful not to be too forward, but if you're "making green" for people and either have a sense of humor or are pretty blunt, .green could be a funny domain alternative.

+ investment.green
+ make.green
+ saving.green

### Sustainability

Sustainability is a buzzword that's here to stay, and "being green" is something more and more people around the world are striving for. So if you're looking to create a sustainability blog or a green company, .green is a perfect fit. 

+ COMPANY.green
+ home.green
+ tips.green

### And if you're Kermit the Frog
