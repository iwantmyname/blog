title: If your user interface promotes bad passwords, you're not doing it right
excerpt: false
----

[Two tweets by Merlin Mann on how technology promotes bad passwords:](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies)

> Tweet 1: If you can entirely set up an Apple TV without screaming at the sky, your passwords probably suck. 
> 
> Tweet 2: I'm not saying all this merely to bitch. I'm concerned that stuff like Apple TV genuinely contributes to people's shitty password choices. 

We (the tech industry) spend a lot of time: 1. promoting good user interfaces. 2. promoting good passwords. If your good user interface doesn't promote good passwords, you're not doing it right.
