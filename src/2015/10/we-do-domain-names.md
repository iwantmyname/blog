[Mike Loukides on wanting tools that do one thing well, as opposed to a number of things not so well:](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/10/do-one-thing.html)

> I’ve been lamenting the demise of the Unix philosophy: tools should do one thing, and do it well. The ability to connect many small tools is better than having a single tool that does everything poorly.

We do domain names. That's it.
