[Brad Smith, Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer, on the collapse of the EU-US Safe Harbor:](http://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2015/10/20/the-collapse-of-the-u-s-eu-safe-harbor-solving-the-new-privacy-rubiks-cube/)

> We need to protect privacy as a fundamental human right. We need a global Internet. We need to keep the public safe. And we need to find a legal path that will work on both sides of the Atlantic. We need to do all four of these things together and simultaneously. This is the privacy version of a Rubik’s Cube.

The world has changed.
