title: An educated guess as to why domain name growth has been stalling

[Jay Dailey, Chief Executive of the .nz registry, on slowing domain name growth:](http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150716_where_has_the_domain_name_growth_gone/)

> The impact of new gTLDs has been to solve the 'meaningfulness problem' by the creation of hundreds of new gTLDs and this in turn directly affects the perception of scarcity. This reduction in scarcity is in turn reducing the incentive to speculate.

> It is my assertion that this speculative behaviour has been a significant factor in historical growth and so domain name growth prospects are partly dependent on what happens to that behaviour. At the macro level, global speculative behaviour in domain names will reduce and the money will switch to a different scarce asset, permanently leaving our industry.

For the foreseeable future people will need domain names to create things on the internet, so registrars will be fine (although the days of bananas growth might be over). But the owners of these new gTLDs are probably sweating a bit. Their [$185,000 investments](http://www.geek.com/news/gtlds-whats-the-process-and-how-much-pay-icann-1392947/) might take much longer than expected to return a profit.
