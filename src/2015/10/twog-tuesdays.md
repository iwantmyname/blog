> Facebook is launching a new initiative called "2G Tuesdays" that will give all employees an opportunity to see what using the app with an incredibly slow connection feels like and help close the "empathy gap" between Silicon Valley and emerging markets.

It's easy to dream up interfaces that take advantage of blinding connection speeds, but businesses trying to reach global audiences need to do a much better job serving the other end of the spectrum. Even here at iwantmyname, our site is relatively minimal, but searching for a domain with a less-than-optimal connection can be grueling. 

Along with responsive interfaces and top-shelf security, speed should be a main priority when building on the web. ([Your 2Mb page weight](http://www.sitepoint.com/average-page-weight-increases-15-2014/) just isn't working for a lot of people.)
