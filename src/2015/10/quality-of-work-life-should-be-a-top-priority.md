[Ana Swanson on how job stress is literally killing people in the US:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/28/researchers-have-determined-how-many-years-of-life-you-lose-to-a-stressful-job/)

> People often like to groan about how their job is "killing" them. Tragically, for some groups of people in the U.S., that statement appears to be true.
> 
> A new study by researchers at Harvard and Stanford has quantified just how much a stressful workplace may be shaving off of Americans' life spans. It suggests that the amount of life lost to stress varies significantly for people of different races, educational levels and genders, and ranges up to nearly three years of life lost for some groups.

Tech startups tend to spend a good deal of time talking about workplace culture and work/life balance, but it's clearly something all business owners and managers need to be working on. These workplace decisions have long term effects.

(On a related note, the US clearly needs to figure out its healthcare system. The amount of years shaved from lack of health care is insane.)
