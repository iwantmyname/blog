[Stuart Jeffries on the stress that choice induces:](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/21/choice-stressing-us-out-dating-partners-monopolies)

> Once upon a time in Springfield, the Simpson family visited a new supermarket. Monstromart’s slogan was “where shopping is a baffling ordeal”. Product choice was unlimited, shelving reached the ceiling, nutmeg came in 12lb boxes and the express checkout had a sign reading, “1,000 items or less”. In the end the Simpsons returned to Apu’s Kwik-E-Mart.
> 
> In doing so, the Simpsons were making a choice to reduce their choice. It wasn’t quite a rational choice, but it made sense. In the parlance of economic theory, they were not rational utility maximisers but, in Herbert Simon’s term, “satisficers” – opting for what was good enough, rather than becoming confused to the point of inertia in front of Monstromart’s ranges of products.

It'd be interesting to see how the domain industry, as a whole, is faring with [500+ (and counting) new gTLDs](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) on the shelves. (Sometimes I think we should just pick the top 25 and say, "This is what we're selling because these are the good ones!")
