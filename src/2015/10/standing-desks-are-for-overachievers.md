[Adele Peters on the new Altwork Station:](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3052273/instead-of-standing-why-not-lie-down-while-you-work-this-desk-lets-you-do-both)

> Maybe you slouch in your Aeron chair. Maybe you tried—and failed—to make using a standing desk a habit. Maybe, like me, your preferred working position is curled up on a sofa.

> The new Altwork Station, designed by aerospace engineers, has a standing and sitting position. But it also reclines fully into a "zero g" position—basically as comfortable as being in bed—with a monitor, laptop, and mouse floating the proper distance away above you.

Out with your standing desk. Out with your upright chair. Out with your yoga ball. If you want to maximize my workplace happiness, I'd like to roll out of my real bed and into a work bed. (To be fair, I already do 75% of my work in a giant beanbag.)
