title: 1API Abuse Domain Suspension Scam
excerpt: false
----

Recently we have been made aware of fraudulent emails that have been sent to a number of high profile domain registrars' customers.

These emails appear to be coming from abuse@1api.net or similar email addresses and attempt to impersonate the Spam and Abuse Department of our in-house domain name registrar 1API GmbH. These suspension emails are NOT being sent from Hexonet, 1API, or iwantmyname.

The fraudulent emails claim your domain name has been suspended because you have failed to respond to previous email and telephone notices.

The email message is an attempt to have you click on links and download files.

DO NOT reply to the email directly.

DO NOT click on any links.

DO NOT call the number listed in the email.

Just delete and ignore the email. If you have any questions or concerns, whether you have received the email or not, [please don't hesitate to contact us](https://iwantmyname.com/support).

This is a copy of one of the emails:
