[MailChimp on how spam filters work:](http://mailchimp.com/resources/guides/how-to-avoid-spam-filters/html/)

> Spam filters consider a long list of criteria when judging the “spamminess” of an email. They’ll weigh each factor and add them up to determine a spam score, which then determines whether a campaign will pass through the filter. They might look for spammy phrases like “CLICK HERE!” or “FREE! BUY NOW!” Then they'll assign points every time they see one of those phrases. Certain criteria get more points than others. Here’s a sample of criteria from SpamAssassin:
> 
+ Talks about lots of money (.193 points)
+ Describes some sort of breakthrough (.232 points)
+ Looks like mortgage pitch (.297 points)
+ Contains urgent matter (.288 points)
+ Money back guarantee (2.051 points)

> If your campaign’s total “spam score” exceeds a certain threshold, then your email goes to the junk folder.
