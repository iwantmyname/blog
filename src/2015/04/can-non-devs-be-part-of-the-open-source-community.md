  * Writing detailed functional specifications.
  * Creating wireframes & mockups.
  * Creating flowcharts, BPMN docs & graphs to explain a project.
  * Planning Poker, Creating sprints.
  * Discussing technical issues with developers.
  * Simplifying technical issues for customers.
  * Learning about new technologies.
  * Explaining new technology to customers.

As Lenz [recently wrote](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html), "At iwantmyname, we not only use open-source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open source." But as a non-developer, truly understanding what open source stands for is a hard thing to grasp. Writers, designers, and project managers can make educated guesses, but getting non-devs involved in the world of open source can only mean good things and more well-rounded ideas for the community. 

In short, questions like the Hacker News thread above are definitely a step in the right direction.
