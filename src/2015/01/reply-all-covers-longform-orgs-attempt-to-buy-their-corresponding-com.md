title: Reply All covers Longform.org’s attempt to buy their corresponding .com
excerpt: false

I’ve never resold or purchased a domain on an aftermarket in my life, but hearing stories about that side of the domain industry is vastly entertaining. There’s intrigue, secret internet dealings, big characters, big egos—it’s all there. And this week, one of my favorite new podcasts, Reply All, covered Longform.org’s attempt to purchase their corresponding .com from Michael Berkens, reseller extraordinaire and founder of The Domains. It’s a good one—give it a listen.

(Just a heads up...if you’re easily offended, there are a couple curse words in this episode. Nothing big, but they’re there.)
