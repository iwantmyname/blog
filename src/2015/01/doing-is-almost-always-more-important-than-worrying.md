[From The Name Inspector:](http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/)

> The Name Inspector has been reflecting on last year’s startup names while sipping on what’s left of the apple peel bourbon he made for the holidays. He’s got to say, it seems like some of these companies were named by people who sipped lots of bourbon. Here are some weird names of startups in CrunchBase that were founded in 2014.

I remember when Nirvana (the band) first started getting played on the radio. Most of my friends were really into the music, but all I could think was “I’m pretty sure I have what it takes to sing incomprehensible lyrics, too! I’m definitely going to be a rock star.” And sure, naming your brand is a whole lot different than singing songs, but the message is similar—extreme talent aside, Nirvana was a success because they actually made music. I wasn’t because I was too worried about everything to ever get on stage.

What I’m trying to say, and what a lot of the startups mentioned in [the article](http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/) prove, is that you shouldn’t let branding uncertainty (or even wackiness) prevent you from doing what you want to do. Sure, maybe you think it’s a mistake to name a brand *AssessUp* or *KeeeWeee*, but look at all these brands. They exist...they’re real companies with profiles on CrunchBase! You just never know what might become the next big household brand.

In many ways, that same thought process also works for domain extensions. I talk to people all the time who spend a lot of energy worrying about not getting the perfect .com, but the world is changing, and people’s comfort level with “strange” non-.com’s is growing by the day. If what you’re creating is good, people will find you wherever you’re at—.io, .co, your local country code top-level domain (ccTLD), or any of the [new domain extensions](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) on the market. Just go with the domain that fits your brand best—the rest will often work itself out.
