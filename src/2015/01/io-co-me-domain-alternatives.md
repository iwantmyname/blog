title: Startup and tech domain name trends in 2015 and beyond. What’s coming after .IO, .CO, and .ME?

<!-- excerpt -->

In the early days of the internet, .COM was the top choice for companies and their online presences. Then, in the second half of the 2000s, we saw country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory), [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) and [.CO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) become popular alternatives for tech startups and developers. Now, after the 2014 introduction of the [new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions), we’re looking at yet another shift. So which TLDs will take the reigns in the tech/startup world? Let’s take a look at some of the contenders.

<!-- /excerpt -->

For companies, we have:

- [.SOFTWARE](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-software)
- [.TECHNOLOGY](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-technology)
- [.DIGITAL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-digital)

Some good options, but with shorter alternatives (e.g. .TECH and .APP) yet to launch, we’ll have to wait and see how they do in the long run.

In addition, developers can choose between:

- [.CODES](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-codes)
- [.CONSULTING](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-consulting)
- [.BUILD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-build)

(On a side note, we were surprised to see .CODES being used for personal sites, i.e. yourname.CODES)

Domain extensions coming soon:

- [.APP](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-app)
- [.TECH](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tech)
- [.CLOUD](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-cloud)
- [.DATA](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-data)
- [.SYSTEMS](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-systems)

.APP is certainly the 800-pound gorilla here, and we’re expecting it to do really, really well (it’s the TLD with the most pre-orders at iwantmyname).

***

All the TLDs above are technology related (for the article), but if you pull back a bit, there's a much more important trend at play here—naming diversity. With [more than 200 new gTLDs already available](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions) and many more to come, why would you restrict yourself by following trendy naming patterns, like what happened in the past with .LY (remember these?), or extensions with inexact meanings like .IO, .CO, and .ME? If you’re starting the next Instagram (which launched using the instagr.AM domain hack), wouldn’t it be better to use instagram.PHOTOS or a more generic instagram.APP, for example?

One of the reasons the .IO, .ME, and .CO domains initially became popular was that they were empty namespaces with lots of keywords available. However, good names are starting to become rare in these “tech-TLDs”, and that’s exactly why we’re so excited about the new top-level domain alternatives. There are now more naming options than ever, and it will take a while—if ever—until good and affordable names are hard to come by.

So will there be a next .IO, .ME or .CO (which are still great domain extensions by the way)? If anything, we see .APP as the most likely contender, but there's no set launch date yet. Until then, when choosing a domain, just remember that [doing is almost always more important than worrying](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/doing-is-almost-always-more-important-than-worrying.html).
