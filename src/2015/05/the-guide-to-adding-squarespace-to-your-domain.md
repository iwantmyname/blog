<!-- excerpt -->

[Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url) is an amazing, all-in-one site builder that makes top-end web design accessible to everyone. Seriously, with no skill going in, you'll be able to build sites, stores, photo galleries, and blogs in minutes. It's that intuitive. 

What's not quite as intuitive though is the domain setup. We pride ourselves in providing one-click installs to a ton of platforms, but sometimes there's an extra step involved that can turn that one click into a bunch of clicks. Have no fear though, with this short guide, you'll have your domain working with your Squarespace site in no time.

<h3 id="section-1">1. Start your Squarespace site</h3>

Get started with Squarespace by clicking **Get Started** on the [Squarespace homepage](http://squarespace.com), choosing a template, then clicking the **Start With This Design** button. There are a couple quick questions you can answer after that, or you can skip them for now.

<h3 id="section-6">6. Copy your verification code (it's right under Host)</h3>

Copy that long string of letters and numbers listed first under the Host column (it'll look somehting like: abcde1fg2h3ijk4lmn5o). This is the verification code you'll add in the iwantmyname dashboard.

<h3 id="section-7">7. Add Squarespace to your domain in iwantmyname</h3>

Open a new window and log into your iwantmyname account, then head to the [Squarespace app setup page](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps/setup/Squarespace/). Click Add Squarespace. 

<h3 id="section-8">8. Paste your verification code</h3>

You've already signed up for squarespace, so now add the verification code to the 'Unique verification code' input. Then click **Install Squarespace**.

<h3 id="section-9">9. Back to Squarespace, hit refresh</h3>

Back on your Squarespace window, if you click **Refresh**, everything should now say Correct. Sometimes it takes a bit (up to a few hours) for these things to work through the internet though, so don't be alarmed if things don't look correct right away. Just jump to the next step.

You're all done! Have fun building your Squarespace site!
