The emerging Wellington company not only has a collection of award winning web design and development [projects](http://archived.link/http://www.boost.co.nz/work) under its belt, but the Boost team have also been working on a suite of web-based software products.

At the forefront of Boost's push into productisation is [IntuitionHQ](http://www.intuitionhq.com/), offering web based usability software as a service. IntuitionHQ recently shot to prominence after [winning](http://www.intuitionhq.com/blog/2011/08/good-news-everybody/) the coveted Booster Seat 2011 prize against stiff competition from dozens of other aspiring New Zealand web and software start-ups.

But wait, that's not all! Parent company Boost are deeply involved in community initiatives in the Capital and have thrown open their doors through a co-working space called [Jelly](http://archived.link/http://www.boost.co.nz/jelly). They also offer occasional free seminars in Agile development methodologies.
