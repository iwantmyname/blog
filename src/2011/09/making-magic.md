Fresh from the 3D scan and "make-off" [event](http://www.makers.org.nz/2011/08/15/3d-scan-and-print-showdown/), the Makers Movement is gathering steam in New Zealand - so to speak. Now the Makers are forging a [community](http://www.makers.org.nz/) to encourage [discussion](http://archived.link/http://makers.org.nz/forums/) and collaboration amongst people who like to design and make stuff digitally. 

Making and building things is in danger of becoming a lost art form as we become more and more reliant on pre-packaged, processed and pre-fabricated goods and with people spending more time with online entertainment. But the Maker community are fighting back.

With digital making service [Ponoko](http://ponoko.com/) based in Wellington, not to mention truck loads of creative and artistic types, it's no surprise that the capital city has a core group of followers. There is even a [weekly meetup](http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonMakers/) where you can catch up on everything that's new in the world of making. Aucklanders are also building and creating, both digitally and in real life. There are frequent project sessions held at a physical maker space called [Tangleball](http://www.tangleball.org.nz/) for artists, builders and writers.

[NZ Makers](http://www.makers.org.nz/) is our featured site for September. Want to share your next project with others? iWantMyName offers easy [one-click DNS set-up](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services) on your domain name for most popular [blog](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/blog-hosting/) and [personal profile](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/services/personal-profile/) sites. We also offer almost 100 different [domain name](https://iwantmyname.co.nz/domains) extensions to choose from.
