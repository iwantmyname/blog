----

[Zerply](http://zerply.com) is an online personal profile service that is rapidly gaining traction with creatives and young Internet users. The company has just launched domain customization, which means you can direct a chosen domain to your Zerply profile site.

Based at Mountain View venture incubator 500 Startups, [Zerply](http://zerply.com/) is an exciting new contender making waves in the digital profile space. Why wait until you need to look for a job before you start building an online profile? At [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com), we love stuff that takes away pain and drudgery. If you already have a personal profile elsewhere and want to move over to Zerply, they make this painless by offering an import process. 

Zerply and LinkedIn are often mentioned in the same sentence. But where LinkedIn caters for corporate networkers and business professionals, Zerply pitches itself more as a solution for promoting one's vocation generally. It also offers attractive design templates that users can tailor to their own specifications, differentiating it from the cookie-cutter approach of LinkedIn. This makes Zerply a more interesting proposition for folks wanting to express a little more individuality. 

Part of the attraction with Zerply is that, [unlike many other social network sites](http://www.zerply.com/premium/custom_domains), you can now overlay your own personal domain name across your Zerply profile site. This adds a personal touch that continues to evade other similar services such as [about.me](http://about.me) or [Google Profiles](http://profiles.google.com). Consequently, we've made it really easy to [connect your domain to Zerply](https://iwantmyname.com/services/personal-profile/domain-customize-zerply) by adding it to our growing list of [hosted services and apps](https://iwantmyname.com/services) in the iwantmyname marketplace. One click and you're away laughing!
