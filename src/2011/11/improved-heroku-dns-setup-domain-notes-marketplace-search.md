title: Dashboard Updates: Improved Heroku DNS Setup, Notes & Marketplace Search
----

This week we've been working on improving our dashboard in response to great feedback you have given us during [Startup Weekend Wellington](http://wellington.startupweekend.org).

### Ability to add notes for a domain

You can now add free-form notes to any of your domains with additional information. Fill in whatever you want, e.g your girlfriend's birthday (you can never have enough reminders), links to external services (you can use basic HTML) or hosting-related information:

### Marketplace App search

With almost 100 entries in the [iWantMyName marketplace](https://iwantmyname.com/services), it has become increasingly more difficult to find the app or service you're looking for. The new [marketplace search](https://iwantmyname.com/dashboard/apps) will help you to set up domains even faster from your dashboard now:

### Choose your Heroku application stack

When [setting up custom domains for Heroku](https://iwantmyname.com/services/developer/heroku-cloud-hosting-custom-domain), there's now a drop-down menu that let's you choose whether you're using the Cedar or Aspen / Bamboo stack. This will add the necessary CNAME and A record DNS settings for your app on Heroku automatically:

There's more to come in November, you should especially keep an eye on our [domain search](https://iwantmyname.com/search?domain=ThisSearchWillBeAwesomeSoon).
