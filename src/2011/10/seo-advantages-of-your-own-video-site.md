title: SEO Advantages Of Your Own Video Site
----

*Guest post by Ray Pawulich, VidCaster.com:*

At VidCaster, we give our users the tools to [build their own video site](http://vidcaster.com). We focus on making this process as easy and painless as possible, but also loaded with advanced features that help you maximize your ROI from online video publishing. One of these features is video SEO that "just works" right out of the box.

###The Key to Video SEO: The Video Sitemap 

As the name implies, video SEO is a subcategory of SEO (search engine optimization) focused on video. Unlike text-based content, video content is not inherently indexable by search engine crawlers. Just uploading a video file to your web-server is not enough for today's search engines to index that content as a video &mdash; if you want your content to come up when a user does a video search, you need to provide search engines with something called a "video sitemap".

Prior to the advent of tools like [VidCaster](http://vidcaster.com), creating a video sitemap was a complicated, manual process. To make matters worse, search engines are constantly changing their desired format for a video sitemap, forcing you to stay on top of those changes and update your video sitemap yourself &mdash; not a great proposition if your goal is to focus on creating & promoting your content.

The end result of this way of doing things is that the vast majority of videos search results are driving traffic to video sharing sites like Vimeo and YouTube &mdash; not the sites of the creators of that content!  

Luckily, VidCaster has revolutionized the creation of the video sitemap by making it automatic and invisible to the user, allowing video publishers to drive traffic to their own site without any additional effort.

###Video SEO at Work

Let's take a look at an example of how [Hackers and Founders](http://www.hackersandfounders.com/), a current VidCaster client, is leveraging video SEO.

Because their video site is set up at [hackersandfounders.tv](http://www.hackersandfounders.tv/) (which means their brand name is right there in the URL), if we [search for "Hackers and Founders" in Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=hackers+and+founders), right on the first page of results we see a video coming from their site:

![Search Result](/media/2011-10-08-vidcaster-blog_post_3.rtfd.png)

Not only is this the only video result shown on the page, but as an individual searching that brand name, I instantly know from the URL that this is official content coming directly from that brand &mdash; not user-generated content on a video-sharing site.

If we click through, we are taken to a landing page on that site: 

![hackersfounders.png](/media/2011-10-08-hackersfounders.png)

Note that all the related videos are videos from Hackers & Founders &mdash; there is no way that the viewer can get lost to someone else's video. Try doing that on a video-sharing site!

By presenting the video in an environment over which they have full control, Hackers and Founders gives themselves the opportunity to use their video content to further a business goal &mdash; which, in this case, is to drive traffic toward their sponsor, Microsoft BizSpark. As you can see, they're doing though VidCaster's in-player call-to-action capabilities as well as with a traditional banner ad on the site (something that's also not possible on traditional video-sharing sites).

###Advanced video SEO: leveraging the video site

For SEO experts, the concept of their own "video site" opens up many possibilities for boosting the organic ranking of not only their video site, but their main site as well. This is because, whether you have your video site set up on its own domain (such as **hackersandfounders.tv**) or as a subdomain (such as **tv.airbnb.com**), search engines will consider your video site wholly separate from your main site &mdash; even though you control both! This allows to strategically use cross-linking between the two in order to share the "SEO juice" one site might get to rank the other site higher for particular search terms.

###Now even easier

Video SEO is a new and interesting space and VidCaster is proud to apply our "it just works" philosophy to this category. That's why we're also proud to announce a new partnership with iWantMyName &mdash; now if you use iWantMyName for domain name management, our service can be easily [added to your domains with just one single click](https://iwantmyname.com/services/video/vidcaster-custom-domain).
