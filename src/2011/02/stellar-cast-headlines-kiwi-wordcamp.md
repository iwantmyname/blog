Over 25 million users globally have set up web sites using open source CMS [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/). So we are greatly pleased to be a micro-sponsor at this weekend's [WordCamp New Zealand](http://wordcamp.org.nz/). We've made a bunch of domains available as prize giveaways for conference delegates. Planning a new WordPress site? You might just score yourself a free 12 month domain registration on us. The offer extends to .COM, .NET, .ORG, .ME and .NZ domains. Conference organisers will provide more information on the day. But you need to [sign up](http://wordcamp.org.nz/products-page-2/) and attend WordCamp NZ to be in the running.

This year's event is being held in the Oceania Room at Te Papa in Wellington which has superb harbour views and is only a few minutes walk from the central city. The speaker line-up is outstanding, including local hero Richard MacManus, founding editor of [Read Write Web](http://readwriteweb.com/) and John Ford whose current project is [VaultPress](http://vaultpress.com/) a back-up site for WordPress users.

WordCamp New Zealand is curated by Dan Milward, developer of the WordPress e-Commerce plug-in [Get Shopped](http://getshopped.org/) and [Jason Kemp](http://www.dialogcrm.com/blog/) who have done a wonderful job of attracting great speakers and building support. After a rather soggy 2010 experience the event was moved to summertime - so let's hope Wellington puts on her best frock and red lippy and shows WordCampers a good time.
