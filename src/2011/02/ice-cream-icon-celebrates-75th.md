Food manufacturer Tip Top began life in a small Wellington ice cream parlour 75 years ago. To celebrate its birthday, the iconic ice cream maker is giving away thousands of Jelly Tips all around New Zealand today. The company now employs over 400 people and produces a staggering 50 million litres of ice cream per annum. From the outset Tip Top has consistently led the industry in product development and marketing, promoting its range of goods with humourous and catchy campaigns that were frequently defined by the Kiwi love of the outdoors. That's the kind of innovation you can sink your teeth into!

The ice cream giveaway commences at 3.30pm today. [Here's a map](http://archived.link/http://tiptop.co.nz/About-Tip-Top/75th-Birthday.aspx) explaining where to pick up your free Jelly Tip.
