<blockquote>
<p>It’s pretty much common knowledge that GMail is awesome. It’s fast, connects seamlessly with the rest of your Google services such as Drive, has a cool app called Inbox, and is overall an extremely powerful email service. However, to use it with a custom domain, you need to purchase Google Apps for either $5 or $10/month, which for casual users is a bit unnecessary. On top of that, you don’t even get all of the features a personal account gets, e.g. Inbox.</p>

<p>However, there’s a free way to use your GMail account with a custom domain: Mailgun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neat trick for more advanced users to set up custom domain email using a standard Gmail account and <a href="http://mailgun.com">Mailgun</a> (for up to 10,000 emails a month). <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/yes-you-can-still-get-free-custom-email-addresses.html">Yes, you can still get free custom domain email addresses</a> — even in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/">From The Name Inspector:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Name Inspector has been reflecting on last year’s startup names while sipping on what’s left of the apple peel bourbon he made for the holidays. He’s got to say, it seems like some of these companies were named by people who sipped lots of bourbon. Here are some weird names of startups in CrunchBase that were founded in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember when Nirvana (the band) first started getting played on the radio. Most of my friends were really into the music, but all I could think was “I’m pretty sure I have what it takes to sing incomprehensible lyrics, too! I’m definitely going to be a rock star.” And sure, naming your brand is a whole lot different than singing songs, but the message is similar—extreme talent aside, Nirvana was a success because they actually made music. I wasn’t because I was too worried about everything to ever get on stage.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to say, and what a lot of the startups mentioned in <a href="http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/">the article</a> prove, is that you shouldn’t let branding uncertainty (or even wackiness) prevent you from doing what you want to do. Sure, maybe you think it’s a mistake to name a brand <em>AssessUp</em> or <em>KeeeWeee</em>, but look at all these brands. They exist...they’re real companies with profiles on CrunchBase! You just never know what might become the next big household brand.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new year, so let&#39;s talk a bit about domain discounts. This month, we have a host of sales carrying over from December, plus two location-based TLDs moonlighting as cultural favorites. .Vegas, hailing from the US city of Las Vegas, is synonymous on the web (and elsewhere) with gambling culture, and will likely draw interest with gaming sites and travel microsites. And .Asia, the world&#39;s largest continent, is attempting to bring online nations together for business and trade. </p>

<p>Take a look at 2015&#39;s first domain discount list, and start the new year right with a shiny new online space.</p>

<p>2014 is done, folks. Our new gTLD catalogue is now filled with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">257 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a>, including the ever-popular <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.club</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link">.link</a>, and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.guru</a> (and of course, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi">.kiwi</a>), and we have a ton more to come in 2015. </p>

<p>Now the big question...has the new gTLD launch been a success? Well, it depends what your metric is. .Xyz recently hit the 750,000 domains registered mark, making it the most registered new gTLD out there, and as Peter Roesler of Inc. <a href="http://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/will-new-top-level-domains-matter-in-2015.html">put it</a>, &quot;If you want to use one of the new TLDs to build a site with an easy-to-remember name, you won&#39;t be disappointed&quot;. Sure, the registration numbers aren&#39;t to the level of .com yet, but I think any gTLD registry owner would tell you it&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. </p>

<p>In 2015, I&#39;d expect to see steady gTLD growth as more people become aware of their existence (if the general public knew about the glorious <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza">.pizza</a> extension, we&#39;d see an online pizza renaissance for sure). And with another year of new launches, paired with the ever-dwindling supply of good remaining .coms, the growth might be faster than people expect. </p>

<p>Prognostication aside, we have a big year of gTLDs ahead of us, and it all begins with the 11 new extensions we&#39;re launching this month. </p>

		<p>I’ve never resold or purchased a domain on an aftermarket in my life, but hearing stories about that side of the domain industry is vastly entertaining. There’s intrigue, secret internet dealings, big characters, big egos—it’s all there. And this week, one of my favorite new podcasts, Reply All, covered Longform.org’s attempt to purchase their corresponding .com from Michael Berkens, reseller extraordinaire and founder of The Domains. It’s a good one—give it a listen.</p>

<p>(Just a heads up...if you’re easily offended, there are a couple curse words in this episode. Nothing big, but they’re there.)</p>

<p>There are very few certainties in life—death, taxes, the fact that eggs always taste better with a dash of hot sauce, and that on January 1st, the little numbers in the year will change ever so slightly. </p>

<p>Pre-internet, this wasn’t such a big deal. Sure, you might write the wrong year on a check or document, but it wasn’t an error the world would have to see on a daily basis. Not like on a website, where nearly all the footers in existence—the big footers, small footers, dark footers, and light footers—share one tiny trait. © 2014.</p>

<p>I say “nearly” because every year there are those who forget to manually change the year from one to the next. It’s a bit of a minor tragedy, but entirely understandable. Fortunately, Mikko Järvenpää has your back, with a clever site called <a href="http://updateyourfooter.com">updateyourfooter.com</a>. </p>

		<p>The holidays are upon us, and we’d like to thank you all for making 2014 so great. In the last year, we upped our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/about">team</a> size to ten, passed the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/celebrating-100000-domains-at-iwantmyname.html">100,000 domains registered</a> mark (and beyond), added more than <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">250 new generic top-level domains</a> (gTLDs) to the list, and managed to keep our <a href="http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname">support satisfaction at 97%</a>. It’s really been incredible—so thank you, thank you, thank you. We can’t say it enough.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting January 2015, we’re launching our monthly newsletter. In it, we’ll include all our domain sales, new gTLD launches, important news, and interesting tidbits to make your month a little better. Here’s the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/monthly">signup page</a>—we really think you’ll enjoy it. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE">Developers, developers, developers!</a> 2015 will be a big year for our API, and we’d love to hear <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/12/api-survey.html">your thoughts</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Speaking of support</h3>

<p>Just a note. With Christmas here and New Year’s coming up, support may be a little slower (but no less thorough) than our usual standard. Our <a href="http://help.iwantmyname.com">Support Center</a> is stocked with answers to a bunch of questions though, so be sure to check there first if you’re running into any issues.</p>

<p>So... sweet as. And happy holidays!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because Apple makes it, Mail is for everybody. But it’s not for everybody. Apple designed it to serve the masses, and if you want more–or less–from your email client, Apple Mail may not suit you. Maybe its old-school approach to mail, lifted from classic mail clients like Eudora and NeXTMail, just doesn’t fit the modern emailer. Maybe you want deep links to productivity apps on your Mac that Mail just won’t provide. Or maybe you’re just tired of being in a dysfunctional relationship with Mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We think Mailbox is the best alternative to Apple Mail out there, but it only works with Gmail or iCloud. If you’re not using either of those providers, the best Mail alternative compatible with most POP/IMAP/Exchange servers is the $10 Airmail 2. Airmail feels like an attempt to create a true replacement for Apple Mail, rather than rethinking the way we process email like Mailbox. However, Airmail also has the concept of filing a message to a “To Do” folder for later processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Email is one of those things people really struggle with, but there are so many tools and apps out there you may find to be more tuned to your liking. If you’re looking for a New Year’s resolution you can actually stick to, commit to making your life a little saner with an email app that fits your workflow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using a new top level domain name instead of a .com or other gTLD does not give you a benefit in Google search results. Ditto for using a .com instead of a new TLD. They’re basically the same.</p>

<p>That’s what Google says. And it makes sense when you think about it. A lot of people that think new TLDs have an SEO advantage are thinking with their heart, not with their head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it doesn’t make sense for Google to favor a new TLD over an existing TLD at this point, it could make sense in the future. It would make sense if it improved search results. Let’s go through some of the arguments that ranking new TLDs ahead of other TLDs would benefit search results, and consider if they are valid now and if they will be in the future.</p>
