<blockquote>
<p>Ask HN: How do technical non-developers help with open source projects?</p>

<p>I used to code for a living but decided that I enjoy being a technical writer and PM much, much more. Things I enjoy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing detailed functional specifications.</li>
<li>Creating wireframes &amp; mockups.</li>
<li>Creating flowcharts, BPMN docs &amp; graphs to explain a project.</li>
<li>Planning Poker, Creating sprints.</li>
<li>Discussing technical issues with developers.</li>
<li>Simplifying technical issues for customers.</li>
<li>Learning about new technologies.</li>
<li>Explaining new technology to customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is; Is there a need for someone like me in any open source projects and if so, how do I contribute?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Lenz <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html">recently wrote</a>, &quot;At iwantmyname, we not only use open-source technologies at the heart of our business, but we also strive to support the cultivation of a community based on the ethics of open source.&quot; But as a non-developer, truly understanding what open source stands for is a hard thing to grasp. Writers, designers, and project managers can make educated guesses, but getting non-devs involved in the world of open source can only mean good things and more well-rounded ideas for the community. </p>

<p>In short, questions like the Hacker News thread above are definitely a step in the right direction. </p>

<p>Many companies say they love open source, but what does that actually mean? Does it mean they use a lot of software other people have written? Does it mean they like that they don&#39;t have to pay for things? Or do they understand that <em>loving open source</em> also means contributing back to the community the code came from?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start again. We at iwantmyname love open source! And when I say we love open source, I mean that we&#39;re always trying to work and live up to its ethos—to continuously share the things we learn, and to approach challenges with facts instead of emotion. Open-source development is all about learning and developing in the open, with people we may never meet in real life—it doesn&#39;t matter to any of us what we look like, who we are, what our gender is, our race, religious beliefs, or sexual preference. It&#39;s all irrelevant. The only thing that matters is how we can work together to make projects awesome.</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p>Time is running out, but you still have until 30 March 2015 to either register or reserve the shorter version of your .NZ domain name before anyone else. As you may know, all ‘second level’ domains like the .CO in ‘.CO.NZ’ and the .NET in ‘.NET.NZ’ are now optional, meaning you can register .NZ names with them, without them, or both (you can read more about it on <a href="http://anyname.nz/">anyname.nz</a>).</p>

<p>Please note that registering or reserving your corresponding .NZ name is entirely optional and will not affect your existing domain. However, it is important to remember that anyone can register domains directly under .NZ after 30 March 2015. For example, if you own the domain myperfectwebsite.CO.NZ and you do not register or reserve myperfectwebsite.NZ, anybody can buy that domain after the pre period ends.</p>

<p>Aside from that little note, have a great weekend! And, as always, please let us know if you <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/support">have any questions</a>. </p>

		<p><a href="http://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html">From Matthew Butterick, in an article titled, &quot;The billionaire’s typewriter&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But un­like the Times, Medium pays for only a small fraction of its stories. The rest are sub­mit­ted—for free—by writ­ers like you. After a long time being elusive about its business model, Medium revealed that it plans to make money by—sur­prise!—sell­ing ad­ver­tis­ing. This means dis­play­ing ads, but also col­lect­ing and sell­ing data about read­ers and writ­ers. So Medium will extract rev­enue from every story, whether it paid for that story or not. (By the way, will that rev­enue be shared with writ­ers? Um, no.)</p>

<p>And com­ing full cir­cle—what’s the in­dis­pens­able tool for cre­at­ing this il­lu­sion of an ed­i­to­r­ial ecosystem? The ho­mo­ge­neous de­sign. The but­ter­fly bal­lot of 2000 (de­picted in why ty­pog­ra­phy matters) proved that er­rors of ty­pog­ra­phy can have his­toric con­se­quences. Medium proves that typog­ra­phy can be used as a tool of eco­nomic lever­age and control.</p>

<p>In truth, Medium’s main prod­uct is not a pub­lish­ing plat­form, but the pro­mo­tion of a pub­lish­ing platform. This pro­mo­tion brings read­ers and writ­ers onto the site. This, in turn, gen­er­ates the us­age data that’s valu­able to ad­ver­tis­ers. Boiled down, Medium is sim­ply mar­ket­ing in the ser­vice of more mar­ket­ing. It is not a “place for ideas.” It is a place for ad­ver­tis­ers. It is, there­fore, ut­terly superfluous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a writer, the state of writing on the web in 2015 is not good. That&#39;s not to say the tools for writing have dried up (there are more now than ever)—it&#39;s just that now, instead of simply writing, I have all sorts of internal issues. Who owns my content? If I don&#39;t own it, who does? Does it matter? Is &quot;homogeneous design&quot; something I even care about?</p>

<p>So here&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from. I have a job that pays the bills, so when I want to get some thoughts into the cloud, I&#39;m not doing it for money, I&#39;m doing it to be a citizen in the communities I care about. As Austin Kleon says in <em>Show Your Work!</em>, &quot;By generously sharing their ideas and their knowledge, they often gain an audience that they can leverage when they need it—for fellowship, feedback, or patronage.&quot; For that goal, Medium, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, are perfect. Sure, everything you see on the page looks exactly the same—same typography, same basic structure—but it&#39;s an instant way for a writer to connect to, and discover, the people they care about. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m lazy, or that I&#39;m unknowingly trading my freedom to be on some Big Brother marketing platform (the billionaire&#39;s typewriter), I&#39;m just in a place in my life where I&#39;m happy to share my thoughts on a platform someone else has created because they&#39;ve removed all the barriers and invited all my friends. It&#39;s a party I didn&#39;t have to plan... I just had to show up. </p>

<p>Medium, for example, has a CMS that anyone on the planet can use, and a design that certainly doesn&#39;t insult my sensibilities. Call it minimalist, homogeneous, whatever—as a writer, I can get in, write something, and send it off to my friends without worrying if it looks good or not. </p>

<p>My only issue with Medium is that its users are fairly anonymous. If I want to find a writer, I have to figure out what their Medium username is, then toss it to the back of the standard Medium URL. Too often, I&#39;m just cycling through articles without ever knowing who the author is—it&#39;s just a mad shuffle of big ideas and original thoughts from people I might not ever know. </p>

<p><strong>What Medium needs is custom domains.</strong> I want to be able to tell a friend to check out chrishall.pizza, not medium.com/@hashtaghall. I&#39;m far too Gen X to want to be a blatant &quot;corporate stooge,&quot; but the Millennial in me just needs a little recognition to be appeased. Give me that level of individuality and I could care less if they leverage my writing to make some money. It wasn&#39;t written to be a profit center anyway.</p>

<p>In the piece linked above, Matthew Butterick paints a solid picture of why someone like himself shouldn&#39;t use Medium. He, like many, value things like site individuality and varied typography more than I do. And he may have a soapbox with Practical Typography that pays the bills and connects him to more people than I will probably ever know. But I don&#39;t think many people want to blog full-time (it&#39;s harder than many think), and they&#39;d probably do anything to avoid having to make design decisions and worry about server costs. They just want to write somewhere their work will be read. And Medium lets them do that. </p>

		<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-23-vanuatu-cyclone.jpg" alt="Vanuatu"></p>

<p>For those of us who live in temperate climates, it&#39;s difficult to imagine
the unfolding horror of a category 5 tropical cyclone bearing down on your
home with winds exceeding 200 mph. But that was the scenario facing the
inhabitants of the far flung islands of Vanuatu recently. The tiny Pacific
Ocean island archipelago took a direct hit from Cyclone Pam, resulting in
many villages being entirely flattened.</p>

<p>Incredibly and thankfully, the death toll as a result of the storm has been kept to a minimum, but a large section of the population has been left without food, water, and housing. Now a major relief operation is underway involving NGOs and neighbouring governments from the South Pacific region such as New Zealand and Australia. Technology is also playing a part in the recovery with power and communications providers rallying to get services running again quickly. We have seen <a href="http://pacificpolicy.org/2015/03/surviving-cyclone-pam/">encouraging reports</a> suggesting that some progress is being made, against all odds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the first time a huge cyclone has ravaged communities in the
Pacific. Typhoon Haiyan wreaked havoc across the islands of the Philippines
in 2013. You may recall our efforts to contribute during the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/11/philippines-typhoon-how-you-can-help.html">Haiyan relief
operation</a>. With your help, we will be financially supporting UNICEF&#39;s operation on the ground in <a href="https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> today with an immediate donation of $6,500. We are thrilled to learn that our cash will pack twice the punch because New Zealand philanthropists Gareth and Jo Morgan have agreed to <a href="https://www.unicef.org.nz/UNICEF-New-Zealand-issues-fundraising-challenge-to-reach-82000-children-in-Vanuatu">match</a> the first $1 million in donations.</p>

<p>iwantmyname has a longstanding policy of setting aside 10 cents from every
domain registration for charitable purposes, but with the crisis being so
great, we&#39;ve dug a bit deeper to help out our neighbours in their time of need. If you want to make your own donation to the Vanuatu relief fund, you can do so <a href="https://www.unicef.org.nz/vanuatu">here</a>.</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2015-03-19-buffer-home.png" alt="Buffer"></p>

<p><a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/acquired-buffer-com/">From Rodolphe Dutel - Buffer:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a great blogpost that Joel wrote on how to name your startup, where he mentioned that the domain name of your startup doesn’t matter. In fact, thinking about Buffer’s own domain history, we originally started out with bfffr.com, when Joel launched Buffer in late 2010.</p>

<p>Joel went on to change it to bufferapp.com, to make things more clear and worry less about not having the exact domain of your startup’s name, “Buffer” in our case. It can be a huge time-suck in the early days of your company, where your first and foremost goal should be to hit product-market fit and building something people want.</p>

<p>Spending time on acquiring a certain domain name could be a very futile exercise without a product that works. In fact, as Joel illustrates, most well-known companies all had “placeholder” domains for a long time before they got their actual name as their domain too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Square was squareup.com</li>
<li>DropBox was getdropbox.com</li>
<li>Facebook was thefacebook.com</li>
<li>Instagram was instagr.am</li>
<li>Twitter was twttr.com</li>
<li>Foursquare was playfoursquare.com</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The primary point of the post is to tell the story of how Buffer acquired buffer.com, but the real story to me is that while most of us aren&#39;t &quot;generat(ing) over $5m/year,&quot; and probably don&#39;t have the time or money to pay what it would cost to get a short .com in 2015, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t get to that level of success with a domain name you find less than perfect. Buffer had a $60m valuation while using bufferapp.com, and the roster of huge brands listed in the post that started with dodgy domains is pretty incredible. </p>

<p>If you take anything away from this, it&#39;s that the domain name you choose is only a minor piece of a very large puzzle. Before you go throwing resources at the domain aftermarket, just grab a name that fits and make your product as solid as it can possibly be. Good work attracts customers—your domain is just a sticker on the door.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sitebuilderreport.com/blog/what-happened-to-virb-after-godaddy-acquired-it">From Steve Benjamins - Site Builder Report:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The culture at Virb began to shift after the GoDaddy acquisition. There were now new bosses and new goals— but not ones that aligned with Virb’s original vision. The 4 original Virb team members decided it was time to leave.</p>

<p>“It was clear to me that our new leadership wanted to extract as much money from our customers as possible.” Ryan Clark, Virb’s Product Manager and Creative Director at the time says. “Our new directive was simple: revenue.”</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the Virb team was denied any resources. After losing the 4 original Virb team members Clark notes, “All of my requests to fill the positions disappeared in the ether of the acquisition. It seemed clear to me that GoDaddy had no intention of backing up their new goals for us with the resources to actually achieve them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t so much an indictment of GoDaddy, as they clearly acquired Media Temple to better compete in the web hosting game (Virb just happened to be part of the deal), but it&#39;s sad to see a once-promising platform slow to a grind. As a writer who frequently uses all-in-one platforms to get ideas on the web, I&#39;ve primarily moved on to Squarespace. It&#39;s fast enough, beautiful, and best of all, dead simple to use. Hopefully we&#39;ll see other hosted, all-in-one solutions take up the torch though—competition in the space is what drives innovation.</p>

	<h1 class="title">
		<a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/mike-carson-compiles-the-most-popular-io-domains.html">Mike Carson compiles the 1457 most popular .io domains</a>
	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p><a href="http://hack.ly/articles/the-most-popular-dot-io-domains-2015/">From Mike Carson:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly one year ago today I created a list of the top .io domains. At that time there were only 676 .io domains in the top 1 million sites in the world (from Alexa). In one year that number has more than doubled to 1457.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s a little sample (the top 10):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>github.io - rank 307</li>
<li>codepen.io - rank 1372</li>
<li>soup.io - rank 3161</li>
<li>intercom.io - rank 3375</li>
<li>t411.io - rank 3477</li>
<li>meduza.io - rank 3546</li>
<li>keywordtool.io - rank 3637</li>
<li>popcorntime.io - rank 4816</li>
<li>spring.io - rank 5566</li>
<li>greenhouse.io - rank 6263</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Short lists are interesting. Massive lists are amazing. </p>
