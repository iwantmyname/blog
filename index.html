		<p>The Internet is not known for having a long attention span. This includes the lifespan of memes.</p>

<p>Vernacular, however, can work a bit differently. Typically it has its genesis among a specific group – often <em>the kids these days</em> – and then spreads among the more mainstream population, particularly via social media.</p>

<p>At which point it&rsquo;s abandoned by its originating group because their parents have just embarrassed them by using it. In public.</p>

<p>The phrase referenced by the abbreviation &ldquo;AF&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t new. ()We won&rsquo;t elaborate on what it means as we are demure professionals&hellip;) I saw references in Urban Dictionary dating back to 2011, but apparently the use, at least verbally, picked up in 2014, in good part thanks to online chat and texting.</p>

<p>.AF domains aren&rsquo;t new, either, but I&rsquo;ve noticed an increase in their registration in the last few months. They&rsquo;re certainly a bold identity statement&hellip; at least among those in the know. :)</p>

<p>You could let the world know that you&rsquo;re <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=interesting.af">interesting.af</a>.</p>

<p>Or I can advertise that I am the most me that I can be with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=melle.af">melle.af</a>.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed to learn that <a href="http://cake.af">cake.af</a> does not appear to involve actual cake.</p>

<p>What I really wonder about is what the registry thinks of the ccTLD&rsquo;s popularity. Because .AF is the country code domain extension for Afghanistan. And like a number of smaller countries, in terms of internet penetration, the registry is managed by the government.</p>

<p>Governments aren&rsquo;t typically known to be on the bleeding edge of all that&rsquo;s hip and memetastic, but I&rsquo;d love to know what the Ministry of Communications and IT thinks of this trend.</p>

<p>However, given the price of .AF domains, one imagines they&rsquo;re very supportive of the trend continuing.</p>

		<p>At this point, there&rsquo;s no denying Etsy&rsquo;s impact on buying and selling craft goods online. The problem with Etsy is that, for as creative as its sellers are, every store is based on a single template. Until now.</p>

<p>With Pattern by Etsy, sellers can create custom sites (with custom domain names) to better differentiate their brand and goods from the rest of the Etsy ecosystem. Just choose from a bunch of clean themes, pick your own fonts and colors, and add some content (your inventory syncs with your regular Etsy store automatically) – that&rsquo;s all you need to add a professional touch to your store. It&rsquo;s not free, but if you&rsquo;re a serious Etsy seller, it could be well worth your while.</p>

<h3>From the web:</h3>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/etsy-launches-pattern/">Techcrunch</a>: &ldquo;Apparently, more than one-third of Etsy’s 1.6 million active sellers have said they’re interested in setting up their own site, but they found the process of registering a domain, creating a site, maintaining it and managing the inventory too complicated.</p>

<p>With Pattern, those sellers can create a site in just a few minutes — a feat that Etsy product lead Joe Lallouz demonstrated this morning for an audience of journalists at the company’s Brooklyn headquarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/etsy-pattern/">Digital Trends</a>: &ldquo;Grishaver said that until now merely launching a custom website could be a complex and frustrating experience for Etsy sellers, “from finding a domain and host, to setting up a site, to loading all of their content, to adding and managing inventory.” And once it’s up and running, there are still plenty of challenges, as sellers must “make sure their inventory stays synced across two or more disconnected sales channels, monitor their analytics, and attempt to optimize traffic and marketing costs.” The answer, Grishaver believes, is Pattern.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re using GitLab as your Git repository manager and want to create a quick, static site about a project (or anything, really), GitLab Pages is your ticket. Much like GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages lets you host static sites directly on your GitLab instance. Just choose a static site generator, use a free shared runner (or your own), and start editing.</p>

<p>Is it for everyone? No. If you&rsquo;re a casual blogger or someone looking at do-it-all site builders like Squarespace, GitLab Pages probably isn&rsquo;t for you. But if you&rsquo;re already using GitLab, or have been waiting for a Pages-type feature to coerce you into switching over from Github, this is perfect.</p>

		<p>We often think of domains as these forever pieces of property meant for big sites that attract as many eyes as humanly possible, but what if you just want to make one person happy? Domains can do that, too! Here&rsquo;s a mini gift guide for Mom, perfect for Mother&rsquo;s Day (May 8th&hellip; put it on your calendar).</p>

<ol>
<li>Pre-order a <a href="[.MOM](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-mom)">.MOM domain</a>. Make it something your mom will go &ldquo;awwwwww&rdquo; over.</li>
<li>On May 3rd, when you get your domain, find as many great pictures of you and your mom as you can. (Bonus points for grandchildren pics, if you&rsquo;re into that).</li>
<li>Create a quick <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/">photo site</a> or <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/blog-hosting/">blog</a> out of the pics, or be ambitious and create an <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/portfolio-hosting/exposure-photo-websites">Exposure</a> story. Exposure is a cool platform for piecing together photos to create a little (or long) narrative – it&rsquo;s a guaranteed crowd pleaser. (And since your site will be public, your mom can send it to all her friends to show them how creative you are.)</li>
<li>You can take the site down anytime, but as long as you renew the domain, you can reuse it every year.</li>
<li>Send flowers. Always send flowers.</li>

	<p>It was mid-2015. There was a bit of a tempest in a teapot online over the launch of the .SUCKS TLD. Did every brand need to buy up all variations of their company/product/service with the .SUCKS TLD to keep them away from technically savvy ne&rsquo;er-do-wells?</p>

<p>Not really, no. Maybe the negative .SUCKS sites are out there, but they seriously lack Google juice and audience engagement.</p>

<p>The truth is, there are a million domain branding strategies that are potentially more important than focusing on whether someone might not like you. Such as? Glad you asked.</p>

		<p>If you like podcasts, this is one of my favorites. And this episode is about domain names!</p>

<p><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/59-good-job-alex/">From Reply All, episode #59</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALEX: So I was thinking, “Wow.” So Alisa had this website. She had it professionally designed many moons ago. When it was still really hard to design a website. So had someone design it for her.</p>

<p>PJ: Like HTML days.</p>

<p>ALEX: Yes. But it was really clunky and difficult to use, so she started getting notices from GoDaddy, and she was just like, fine, this thing can expire. But the thing is, that she didn’t quite understand what would happen when you let your domain name expire. I think she just assumed that the site itself would go away, but nothing would happen to the domain name. Like she could come back to it whenever she wanted.</p>

<p>PJ: Mm mm.</p>

<p>ALEX: Are you saying, “No she didn’t think that,” or “No that’s not what happens?”</p>

<p>PJ: I’m saying the thing she believed in the past was not true.</p>

		<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/media/2016-03-16-merlene.jpg" alt="Merlene"></p>

<p>Merlene is a self-described hoarder. Fortunately, she hoards domains, and not cats or anything weird. (She insists that two cats do not qualify as a hoard).</p>

<p>Having been self-employed for a long time, Merlene is familiar with all sides of the online business game, from registering domains to teaching customers how to post content and use their email accounts. She has extensive experience working with everyone from IT staff to small business people to complete newbs, so she can help figure out what you need and get it built.</p>

<p>She can also help with your social media and marketing efforts, mix you a killer cocktail, and knit you cool stuff. (She&rsquo;s a hobbyist yarn entrepreneur at <a href="https://knitcreek.com/">knitcreek.com</a>.)</p>

<p>Amazingly, even though Merlene didn&rsquo;t mention in her interviews the fact that long ago, in the mists of Internet time, she contributed to one of the Internets for Dummies books, we were totally jazzed to hire her.</p>

<p>In her first weeks on board, we threw her in the deep end with support, and she&rsquo;s done swimmingly. She even tackles tricky ccTLD edge cases with gusto. Unfortunately, while she&rsquo;s with us in New Zealand, her home is without tech support, and the residents may end up forced to converse with each other, or just post cat gifs&hellip; assuming internet access holds&hellip;</p>

<p>PS. It is, indeed, Merlene with three Es.</p>

		<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when building a grand personal website sounded like a great idea. People – regular people – were committing a few hours a day to it, and actually making money. But somewhere around the middle of the 2000&rsquo;s, social media got big, people started expressing themselves with shortform content, and consistently writing medium-to-longform posts became a major chore.</p>

<p>Now, when I go and poll my friends and coworkers, the ones who still have traditional blogs are almost all living with a touch of guilt. Their online castles are outdated, their latest posts are collecting cobwebs, and the majority of their real writing is either going to their work or their social media accounts. (BTW, if this describes you, Timo recently <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html">wrote a great post</a> about some alternative things you can do with your domain(s).)</p>

<p>But blogging isn&rsquo;t dead. Far from it. It&rsquo;s just different. Sure, there are those who still have dedicated personal blogs, but the newest trend is to push infrequent content to platforms that already have a huge reach, like Medium. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/03/medium-plans-publisher-monetization-within-a-month-considers-paywalls-and-premium-content/">recent quote</a> from Medium founder, Ev Williams,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think publishers who are experimenting with Medium are seeing a world where it’s not about having a website,” said Williams. “There are not going to be tens of millions of websites that lots of people go to every day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Medium offers is a way for people to write what they want with a solid CMS, on a platform that takes style decisions away from the author. That probably sounds terrible to some, but for many people, it&rsquo;s a way to express themselves without having to worry about the stuff they&rsquo;re not good at. Just write something up, hit publish, and let people read. Once they&rsquo;re done, they won&rsquo;t judge you for not updating often enough or having an outdated site, they&rsquo;ll just hit next and read one of the other million posts Medium has to offer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I see it. The dream of the internet is to be able to share yourself – your ideas, your art, your dreams – with like-minded peope everywhere. It connects us. But what we&rsquo;ve learned is that not everyone needs a castle for their personal thoughts. A castle requires a ton of upkeep. Instead, a lot of us might just need a small house to store stuff in. If you&rsquo;re writing tweets, Facebook posts, Medium entries, taking pictures with Instagram, and trying out a handful of other platforms, you probably don&rsquo;t need a personal blog on a personal website to feel guilty about not keeping up with. All you need is a little <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html#section-3">one-pager</a> that links to all the things you do so you can keep track of it all.</p>

<p>Writing a new resume and need to find that link to that great post you wrote last year? With a good one-pager, it&rsquo;ll be easy to find. Can&rsquo;t remember what photo app that good picture of your dog is on? With a good one-pager, it&rsquo;ll be easy to find. Want to direct a new friend, client, or employer to a place where they can see all the work you do without needing to sift through ten different web platforms? One-pager. Seriously.</p>

<p>To sum this up (I like a good, clear takeaway), stop feeling guilty, as I always do, about spending your time writing on platforms that aren&rsquo;t owned and designed by you. Getting your thoughts out there is more important than worrying about the authenticity of writing on a personal blog. If you want a blog, great! But if you just feel like writing every once in a while, publish it anywhere! Just, for the sake of not writing something you&rsquo;ll forget about in a year, get a little website that links to your stuff wherever it&rsquo;s posted.</p>
