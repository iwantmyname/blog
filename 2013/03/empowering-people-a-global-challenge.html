					<h1>Empowering People A Global Challenge</h1>
				
				
				

				<p>For a long time the domain name industry had an unfortunate reputation for being unnecessarily difficult to navigate; a reputation which discouraged internet literacy and hampered moves towards a better public understanding of the fundamental concept of a digital identity. Consequently, a few years ago we began developing <a href="https://iwantmyname.com">iwantmyname</a> as a tool to overcome this problem and as a way to make creating and owning a digital identity as easy as clicking a few buttons. We also resolved to end ISP lock-­in by making it easy for everyone to set up email on a domain they have personal control over.</p>

<h3>Challenges while bootstrapping</h3>

<p>Bootstrapping a technology company without any external funding places many constraints on both time and cashflow and until recently we had to satisfy ourselves with supporting local events and initiatives on a smaller scale with occasional beer and pizza. Having said that, many <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/">user groups</a> and <a href="http://wellington.startupweekend.org">event organisers</a> in Wellington and across New Zealand love us for it and we see it as an important contribution to our local community and a learning experience for ourselves too. Further afield, we supported many good causes globally with free domains and we are now finally in a position to contribute to other projects that have a positive influence on society.</p>

<p>For example, a movement called the &quot;Good for Nothing Challenge&quot; started recently in the UK as a way for (mainly IT folk) to contribute a weekend towards a charity to build stuff they need, such as websites and helpful productivity tools. In New Zealand the <a href="http://www.gfnchallenge.org/index.html">Good For Nothing Challenge</a> took this idea a step further. We have wrangled some of our smartest star-t­up people and plan to fly to Cambodia for a week in order to help a number of charity organizations overcome hurdles with their infrastructure. We will help them to optimize work flows, build tools they need to operate efficiently and solve some basic issues they don&#39;t have time or resources for currently. We plan to have an enduring influence on a handful of Cambodian charities and build a long term relationship with them to give them ongoing support.</p>

<h3>Cambodia Shows True Grit</h3>

<p><img src="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/assets/images/content/2013-03-06-grit-cambodia.png" alt="grit-cambodia.png"></p>

<p>Cambodia is a nation with a predominantly young population emerging bravely from a difficult history and now facing many developmental challenges. In April, Lenz and Manu from the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/about">iwantmyname team</a> will fly to Cambodia and work on Grit, a program that gives tablets to kids in very poor areas to improve the quality of learning in an environment that currently has too few teachers and too large class sizes to efficiently teach young kids. We will work with the Kampuchean Action for Primary Education (KAPE) to help roll out Grit in a larger field trial and work on Grit itself to improve the quality of the application and align it with international education standards. We are excited to be in a position where we can begin supporting the GFN Challenge and other similar projects down the track.</p>

<p>We hope to make a lasting impact and extend ourselves from, not only enabling the general public in the first world to owning their digital identities, but also giving tools to children in the third world that help them learn maths and English, allowing them to be less dependent on external help later in their lives. iwantmyname is all about enabling people, and we always want to push the boundaries of what that means to us. We are working on a way for our customers to contribute directly to our fund that goes towards projects like the GFN Challenge. Expect more reports from Cambodia and in the future from other similar projects that enable people.</p>
