					<h1>Startup Genesis: Musings Of A Non-Technical Founder</h1>
				

				

				<!-- excerpt -->

<p><strong>Guest post from Oliver Townend writing about his experiences as a web company founder.</strong></p>

<p>Toward the end of 2011 I had an idea for an on-line business that seemed to make perfect sense. It grew out of a situation I have been frustrated by repeatedly in my time as a building contractor. It made use of existing technology and it had a potential target market that grew every time I bothered to think about it.</p>

<p>I was excited, finally I had an idea that worked. I brainstormed and refined and built on the basic concept to the point where I had (in my head) a hugely complicated product packed full of exciting features and backed up by some wildly optimistic financial predictions. There was one major problem however: I had no experience of start-ups and absolutely no idea how to make it happen.</p>

<!-- /excerpt -->

<p>The concept itself is fine. In theory it works and there is a market for it. But if I couldn&rsquo;t build the product then it would only ever be an unrealised opportunity and one day someone else would do it. I&rsquo;d get grumpy and resent them for it. I needed help. The first step was to tell people about it. Not in a comprehensive market validation way (I didn&rsquo;t read The Lean Startup till much later) but just to get different perspectives, discuss the concept and discover if there was merit in taking it further.</p>

<p>I got myself a <a href="http://www.businessmentors.org.nz/">business mentor</a> and told them about it. I asked around and found a couple of lawyers willing to meet informally and talk through the legal implications. I rang everyone I could think of who could possibly use this product and told them what I was trying to do. Most people recommended someone else to talk to.</span></p>

<p>The feedback was fascinating. Ranging from &ldquo;<em>Yes,
I want that, when can I have it?</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>No, I see no benefit in that</em>&rdquo; and most interestingly &ldquo;<em>I
can&rsquo;t talk to you about that, we&rsquo;re trying to do the same thing</em>&rdquo;. The positives maintained my enthusiasm. The negatives forced me to confront my deficiencies. The competitors proved that I wasn&rsquo;t the only person working on this and I needed to get moving. The hardest conversations revealed previously hidden problems and opportunities that have contributed hugely to the refinement process. Every time I explain or defend my theories I get better at it.</span></p>

<p>I realised several things very quickly:</p>

<p>1) The product needed to be simplified dramatically. What I thought was the key feature had been tried before, was fundamentally flawed and nearly impossible to execute. Another feature I hadn&rsquo;t given much thought to had much more promise.</p>

<p>2) No-one I spoke to was going to blatantly steal my idea, especially the sort of busy, technical people who could if they wanted to. They have other things going on. I have a head start at working on figuring it out, the more I get done on my own the more likely it is that I&rsquo;ll have something valuable in the future.</p>

<p>3) I had a lot of work to do and no time to do it, I was already running a business and had no spare time to spend working on the new one.</p>

<p>4) I needed to talk to a lot more people.</p>

<p>5) I needed collaborators. Technical collaborators&hellip;more about this next time.</p>
