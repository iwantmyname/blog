And by the end, you'll have a great, easy-to-remember domain such as 'james-fighting-cancer.com' as your hub for accepting donations.

There are several reasons to use personal domain names for crowd-funding pages, first of which is the fact that they make it easier for supporters to draw connections between who you are (friend/family) and what they are supposed to do (donate). After all, it's important to recognize that many people will not immediately visit your page, so you'll want to provide them with a relevant domain name that's easy to remember for future reference. Taking this approach will help increase the total amount of contributions you'll receive, and will help show your commitment to hitting your goal.

Another major benefit of attaching a custom domain name to your crowd-funding page is that it will build legitimacy for your cause. Keep in mind that people are exposed to hundreds of online fundraising campaigns each year, so you should take every possible step to make it easier for them to decide if yours will be one of the causes they decide to financially support.

Selecting the right domain name can be intimidating for some people though, so we've compiled a list of proven tips that will help you get the most out of the name you choose to purchase.

##1. Selecting the correct domain extension

Before you even begin contemplating your online fundraising domain name,
you will need to choose the domain extension (.net, .com, .io, .org, etc.) that makes the most sense for your particular cause. Although most people automatically assume that .com makes the most sense, this is not always the case. For example, if you are hosting a fundraiser specifically for a cause that is based out of Japan, it could be much more beneficial to add a personal touch by selecting the .jp domain extension. After all, going with a country-specific domain name will be much more relevant, and can help capture the attention of local supporters.

On the other hand, if your fundraiser has global appeal, it could be ideal
to choose .com or a new [generic domain extension](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions). As you can see, there's definitely a lot to think about and choose from before you lock yourself into any specific domain extension.

Another important thing to note about extensions is that they can alter a potential supporter's perception of your efforts to crowd-fund. For instance, while .com has become synonymous with almost any type of website, the reality is that it was created for sites of a more business nature, whereas the original purpose of .org was to provide a resource for organizations—often nonprofits. Due to this, .org might be more appealing for some charity campaigns, but you should still carefully consider utilizing .com because it's usually easier for people to remember.

##2. Choosing your domain name

It is easy for people to become overwhelmed with all the potential
possibilities for their domain name, but there is a very simple way for
most to settle on a name that makes sense.

"Your domain name should be your company name." [Christopher Heng](http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/domainname.shtml ) from
thesitewizard.com explains that naming your domain after your company may
seem obvious to some, but a surprising amount of domains aren't correlated at all.

Consider, for example, how confusing it would be if your nonprofit was known by a name that was completely different from your domain name. This would make it much harder to remember what to type in the address bar, and could eventually lead to preventing people from visiting the site. And that, in turn, could make overall donations suffer.

Another important reminder is that you want search engines to be on your side. If you are a nonprofit organization, your supporters are going to look for
the ability to make online donations by entering your organization's name
into their favorite search engine. But if your organization's name and your domain name aren't related, search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo might not be able to link to the appropriate content. 

##3. Choosing a name without an organization

We realize a lot of people host fundraising pages that are not associated with specific organizations. In fact, there are millions of people worldwide who are currently crowd-funding for a variety of reasons, including medical, memorial and natural disasters. If this is the case for your campaign, it might seem more daunting to pick an appropriate domain name. However, there is actually a simple process to help you land on a name that will be easy for supporters to remember. 

The first trick is to use your domain name to tell people who and what you are raising money for. For example, if you have a friend named James who is currently fighting cancer,  james-fighting-cancer.com would be a good choice. Anyone who knows James will draw the connection—this donation is for “James” and the money will go towards his medical bills to fight cancer. It's this logical process we're looking to achieve, and it can be all done with a domain name!

One point to note is the use of hyphens in the domain name above. While some people question the use of hyphens, our experience indicates that they can actually add much-needed clarity. As an added bonus, choosing a longer domain name such as james-fighting-cancer.com or james-medical-fundraising.com is much more likely to be available (buying domains that are already registered can be [quite expensive](http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html)) , and is extremely easy to read and remember. Also, from a search engine perspective, hyphens are ok because they're treated as spaces between words.

The second thing to think about is specificity. If you choose to use a longer domain, make sure it's as precise as possible. For instance, james-fighting-cancer.com is good, but james-medical-fundraising.com adds an extra layer of specificity. It's a good idea to be very up front with your needs, and james-medical-fundraising.com spells out the fact that you are trying to raise money, though we understand this will vary from case to case. Use your best judgement.

##4. Keep it simple

In the previous tip, we explained that it's perfectly acceptable to utilize
hyphens for clarity. However, there is the danger of incorporating *too many*
words or hyphens into your domain name. For example, using more than three hyphens is likely to confuse your visitors. And even if you choose not use hyphens, stringing too many words together can be equally confusing to read and even harder to memorize. It's also important to note that domain names that are more than four words long run the risk of being cut off by most link services like Twitter. 

Your best bet is to stick with a name that utilizes three or fewer words and
hyphens. And if you follow the adage of keeping it simple, you will never need to worry about using too many characters or having a domain that's too hard to memorize.

##5. Oversimplification is bad

Now that we've touched base on the importance of keeping your domain name simple, you might be looking at options that could actually hurt your goal. Therefore, it is critical to learn the difference between a simple domain name and an oversimplified one. 

For example, if your friend goes by the name DJ, it would make perfect sense to choose dj-medical-fundraising.com as your domain name. However, it would be an oversimplification to select DJMF.com, as this has no easily discernible meaning.

Another trend that you may want to avoid is choosing a country extension in order to make a creative word. For example, it [used to be popular](http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2008/10/23/how-to-get-yourself-a-sweet-ly-domain-name/) to choose an English word then add .ly at the end such as useful.ly, but the practice has fallen out of favor because it's generally harder to say and more difficult to remember.

The avoidance of oversimplification and so-called cute wordplay will ultimately make it easier for you to connect with people who will be interested in supporting your cause. With this in mind, you should also remind yourself not to give into the impulse of creating a domain name that is overly clever. It will only hurt your cause, especially because some people will not understand the intention of your chosen domain name. Keeping it simple without oversimplifying is always the best course of action.

##6. The decision of whether or not to use numbers

It is typically suggested that numbers should not be incorporated into domain names, but there are some compelling arguments for them. For example, the Internet provides you with access to the entire world, and
numbers are often used to convey meaning in other languages (like Chinese, as highlighted in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFTW_abinnM)). Another example is if the number is being used to increase specificity—like if you're raising money to pay for an 88th birthday party. Spelling out 88 would make your domain name unnecessarily long, and would most likely confuse people, so choosing something like james-88th-birthday.com or james-88th-fundraiser.com would make sense.

Just remember to use common sense when determining if numbers are appropriate for your domain. If their culturally relevant, or make things more specific, they may indeed be helpful for people trying to find your page.
