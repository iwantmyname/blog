title: May 1st is .KIWI day
excerpt: no

---

Like little online children, we love each generic top-level domain (gTLD) the same. .GURU, .RED, .PHOTOGRAPHY—all are lovely in their own special way. But if we were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one, we'd choose .KIWI, New Zealand's choicest new domain extension.

On May 1st, .KIWI is set to launch, and we're really hoping it takes off with local businesses and bloggers. Because...well...we'll finally have a TLD that's as unique and quirky as we are.

So go on—[pre-orders](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi) are only open for a while longer. Make sure you are ready when .KIWI takes off!
