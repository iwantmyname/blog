<!-- excerpt -->

So you've come up with a plan to create a fully functional website with a blog, plenty of useful content and maybe even an online store. [Getting a domain](https://iwantmyname.com/) is easy (although [selecting a domain name](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt2.html) may take some thought), but actually building your site without coding knowledge or a freelance budget can be a real challenge. Unless you're using Squarespace.

<!-- /excerpt -->

With [Squarespace](https://iwantmyname.com/features/applications/custom-domain-apps/websites/squarespace-build-your-website-with-own-url), even writers like myself can take one of the many professional [templates](https://squarespace.com/templates/) provided and tweak it to become something that's completely original—all without needing to deal with hosting space and servers like you would with Wordpress.org. You can easily edit things like colors, fonts (from Google and Typekit) and sizes using simple sliders, you can integrate blogs and photo galleries to any page, and third-party integrations like Amazon products, Instagram feeds and Soundcloud files are just a few clicks away. And if you're really on a shoestring budget, you can even use [Squarespace Logos](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/need-a-logo-squarespace-has-you-covered.html) to craft a logo with some nice fonts and simple designs.

For many users though, the [Commerce](http://www.squarespace.com/tour/shops) features are the main draw. Using a the same simple integration tools you use to add third-party integrations, you can add products to your site, manage your inventory, take payments and customize marketing emails. It really is a one-stop-shop for all your ecommerce needs.

##Setting up your domain with Squarespace

Once you're ready to build your Squarespace site, adding your domain is super simple. First, head over to your iwantmyname dashboard and select **Apps & Services** under the **Setup** menu. Then, under the **Website Builder** category, click on Squarespace (or just type in Squarespace in the search field). Now, just add it to your domain and click **Install Squarespace**.

Once you're done with the iwantmyname side, just login to your Squarespace account (or sign up for one) and click on the **Settings** icon. In that menu, you'll see a **Domains** option, which will show a **Link Existing** button in the top-right corner. From there, just type in your domain and you're all set up (if you need help on the Squarespace side, their [tech support](http://help.squarespace.com/) is quite responsive).

And that's it! You're now ready to build a website for all the world to see.

##A quick note about separating your domain from your hosting platform

We've had many customers ask us about Squarespace's offer for a free domain when you pre-pay for a full year of their service. It's a great deal from a cost standpoint, but there are some major drawbacks to keep in mind: 

1. you'll lose a lot of flexibility and most of the one-click install features iwantmyname offers (for adding things like [custom email addresses](https://iwantmyname.com/services/email-hosting/) and [URL shortening](https://iwantmyname.com/services/url-shortener/)).

Expanding on the loss of flexibility, here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. The free Squarespace domains are limited to .com, .net, .org, .info, .mobi and .biz, which means you can't use a ccTLD like .uk or .io or a new gTLD like .club or .photography.
2. As long as you're a Squarespace customer paying by the year you're fine, but if you downgrade your account or want to change platforms, you'll have to transfer your domains fairly quickly.
3. If you want to create a companion site for a one-off campaign, you'll have to register that domain somewhere else. As of now, Squarespace only lets you host one domain at a time.
