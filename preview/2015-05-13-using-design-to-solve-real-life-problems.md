Designers. Friends. Frienemies. For too long you've been using domain names like fullnamedesigns.com, and the slightly more mysterious lastnamedesigns.com, to show off your online portfolios. Today, I'm going to explain to you why you've been doing it all wrong. 

<!-- /excerpt -->

For this example, let's pretend that all the letters in a domain name before the "." are pieces of furniture... and they're all beautiful. Here's the question. In a well-designed space, how many beautiful pieces of furniture would you want? Five? Six? Eight? Yes, yes, yes.

15?! 

Woah, woah. That's a lot of furniture before the dotâ€”but that's how many letters there are in "fullnamedesigns." And if your name happened to be Nathaniel Tabernacle (a completely made up name), you're looking at a whopping 19!

So how do we fix this? Just nix the word "design" before the dot and go with the brand new [.DESIGN](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-design) top-level domain (TLD), the designiest TLD on the market today (although [.NL](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/nl-dutch-domain-name-registration-for-netherlands) might give you some Dutch designery street cred). Instead of fullnamedesigns.com, you could just have fullname.designs! Beautiful spacing. Clean, legible words. It's everything you could ever want from your domain name. 

And from May 18th to June 1st, we're dropping the price of .DESIGN from $69 USD to $39 USD. That's less than some people spend over the summer on a week of morning cold brews (coffee, not beer... although morning beer is delicious).

Let's make this happen, designers. Your domain names are all cluttered with excess and it's giving people anxiety attacks.
