If there's one piece of advice we could give to someone who is starting a website or blog, it's that you should take some time to pick the right web platform for your needs. If you have the resources to develop a custom site, that's a great option, but another is to use one of the many wonderful platforms currently on the market. 

For absolute beginners, we usually recommend some sort of [hosted solution](https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/)—a platform that bundles a modern content management system (CMS) with hosting space. You lose some flexibility with hosted platforms, but the benefits of something that's truly plug-and-play often outweigh the lack of control. 

But if you're comfortable dealing with managing your own hosting space, you're open to a whole world of platforms that give you control over even the smallest details. And the most popular of these platforms is [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) (.org, not .com, which is a hosted platform), which in 2013 made up [18.9%](http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/general-news/wordpress-infographic-2013-a-visual-representation-of-matts-state-of-the-word) of the internet and was downloaded 46 million times.

If this is an option you're looking into, here's a rundown of how to link a custom domain to [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/), our favorite web host for sites with minimal complexity.

<!-- /excerpt -->

1. Grab a domain at [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/).
2. Once your domain is registered, select Setup in the top nav, then click Manage DNS.
3. Next to your domain, click the Update Nameservers link.
4. In the Popular Settings dropdown menu, select Bluehost, then click Update Nameservers. (Note: When you change your nameservers, one-click installs won't work anymore. If you have any platforms currently installed like Bit.ly or Google Apps, you'll need to reinstall those settings in your new Bluehost DNS manager.)

Now that you're setup on the iwantmyname end, head over to [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/) to get your hosting space. From there, you'll have access the [Bluehost admin page](https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/home#main), which will let easily install Wordpress with your custom domain name.

If you need any additional help with the domain side of the equation, be sure to [let us know](https://iwantmyname.com/support). Otherwise, the team at Bluehost should be able to answer any hosting-related questions.
