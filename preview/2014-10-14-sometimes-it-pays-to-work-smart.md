From the Moz Blog, in an article titled "My Recipe for Success: How to Launch a Successful Blog":

>So, five months on, where are we? Well, I'm particularly happy with the results so far, and this is why I wanted to outline the approach that I've taken from a content, social, and SEO perspective to get results.

>On the topic of results, here's where we're at right now:

+ Page 1 rankings in Google for the terms pescetarian, pescetarian blog, pescetarian recipes and pescetarian meals. Go ahead, Google it if you don't believe me ;)
+ 4,700+ followers on our Facebook page
+ The average engagement on one of our Facebook posts will often result in around 100 likes, 5-15 comments, 20-50 shares and 100-300 clicks through to the website
+ 850+ Twitter followers
+ 500+ Pinterest followers
+ 550 double opt-in email subscribers
+ 30,000+ unique visits to the blog
+ 15,000+ unique visits coming from social media traffic alone
+ 65,000+ backlinks

>Although it's early in our campaign, I'm going to share how we've achieved what we have so far and give you as much actionable information as to how you can go out and replicate the early success that we've had. This will include the exact strategies that I've implemented, the tools that I've used and any tips for accelerating growth.

On personal blogs, I've been a pretty strong proponent of what I call the John Gruber method—if you consistently write something worthwhile, people will eventually come. But if you have time, dedication, and resources, the "people will eventually come" part can sometimes be changed to "people will come very soon."

Truth is, there's a real science behind generating blog traffic, and it involves great content, SEO, social media, email, and a open eye to new ways to promote what you write. You just have to know where to start—and you could do a lot worse than starting here.
