If you've been on the [iwantmyname website](https://iwantmyname.com/) lately, you might've noticed a change in the bottom right corner of the footer—a multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices in only US dollars, you can switch currencies to NZD, GBP, AUD, and EUR. It's a small feature, but one we're really happy to roll out.

#A Little Backstory

For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard. 

But now we're a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we've officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We've been soft-launching it for a few weeks now, and we're really happy with how it's working (it's nice to see things in NZD).

So next time you're looking for a domain, head over to our [homepage](https://iwantmyname.com/) and pick your home currency in the bottom-right of the footer.
