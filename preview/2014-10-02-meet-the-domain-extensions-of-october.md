<!-- excerpt -->

September was a giant month for new domain extensions, with 32 new top-level domains (TLDs) coming out, including the popular [.london](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-london) (now the eighth most popular new gTLD) and [.nz](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-nz) (which reportedly passed [17k registrations](https://twitter.com/dotnz/status/517102502731190272) in the first 24 hours). With the biggest month to date now behind us though, it's time to look to the month ahead. For October, we only have six new domain extensions for you, but a few of them are certain to be very popular.
