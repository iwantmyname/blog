I'm a bit of a sucker for clean, utilitarian blog platforms, and Silvrback is definitely one of my current favorites. The concept is simple—you write what you want in the Markdown editor, then post. No widgets or distractions—just beautiful, beautiful simplicity. 

And now it's even better. [From Damian Sowers - Silvrback:](https://dsowers.silvrback.com/welcome-to-silvrback-2)

>I'm proud to announce the release of Silvrback 2.0! There are numerous changes to the whole platform. I'd like to thank all of the existing Silvrback users out there who have been giving me valuable feedback.

<!-- /excerpt -->

Check the announcement page for all the details, but 2.0 has a new UI scheme that changes "both your front-end blog and the back-end editing platform (and some other pages like your bio admin)," gives you full-page cover photo support, iframe embeds and a ton more.
