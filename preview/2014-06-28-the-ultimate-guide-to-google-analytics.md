One of the first things people tend to do as soon as they set up websites is install some kind of analytics platform. Some people choose paid platforms like [Clicky](http://clicky.com/) and [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com/), but most chose [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), the completely free platform that does just about everything you could ever want an analytics platform to do. 

And there lies the problem—what the heck are people supposed to do with analytics? Sure, it's fun to see what parts of the world users are coming from and what pages are being read more than others, but the amount of data you can gather from Google Analytics is astounding. If you know what you're doing. 

From Kaitlin Ziessler, introducing her article titled [Google Analytics Resource Guide of Epic Proportions](http://builtvisible.com/google-analytics-resource-guide/?utm_content=bufferaf916&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer):

>This is meant to educate and be a resource for people on a range of GA topics from types of tracking to what exactly is being calculated to even cover some common issues seen recently. So either start at the top and read the whole post or click on a specific topic and just read that section if you prefer. Enjoy!

As advertised, it's a resource of epic proportions. It goes over types of tracking, what Google Analytics tracks, how you can improve your data gathering, frequent issues and a number of resources and tools you can use to get everything you can out of the platform. 

It's quite impressive, and if you're a Google Analytics user (or plan on being one soon), you really should take the time to dive in.
