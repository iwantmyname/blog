title: September domain discounts, featuring .CLUB and .TV

We consider discount-oriented online businesses to be an unhealthy model, but each month we do like to put a few domain extensions on sale as a market predictor of sorts. This month, we're really excited about a few country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) that double as generic phrases and a couple of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) that we just like right now.

+ [.TV ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/tv-tuvaluan-domain-name-registration-for-tuvalu)-  $34.90/yr (from $39)
+ [.CO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/co-colombian-domain-name-registration-for-colombia) -  $15.50/yr (from $29.90)
+ [.ME](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/me-montenegrean-domain-name-registration-for-montenegro) - $19.90/yr (from $24.90)
+ [.IO](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/io-domain-name-registration-for-british-indian-ocean-territory) - $49.00/yr (from $59.00)

.CO, .ME and .IO (especially for tech sites) have been consistent for some time, but .TV has been especially newsworthy of late because of the twitch.tv acquisition by Amazon. I've always been interested in the idea of TLDs categorizing the web, and .TV makes perfect sense for online video portals.

+ [.CLUB](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club) - $9.90/yr (from $19.90)
+ [.BUZZ](https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-buzz) - $34.90/yr (from $49.00)

Before the launch of the gTLDs, .CLUB was simply trying harder at marketing than the majority of the field. At the end of the day, the public will be the decider of gTLD popularity, but if any extension will reach mass expectancy by sheer will, it's going to be .CLUB. On the [Domain Incite Pro](http://domainincite.com/pro/new-gtld-zone-file-report/) registrations list, .CLUB is currently in third place, with just over 100,000 domains registered—a huge milestone for the overall namespace expansion.
