<!-- excerpt -->

Being involved in the local community is vastly important to us, so this year we made a conscious decision to support more events that at least some of the iwantmyname team could actively participate in. Since we are already one-third of the way through 2015, I think it's about time to take stock of what has been achieved so far and look at where we plan to go in the future.

Startup Weekends loom large in our consciousness, and this year has been no exception. Organisers of [Startup Weekends here in New Zealand](http://www.startupweekend.co.nz/) have a busy schedule planned, and we've already been lucky enough to sponsor and participate in the recent Wellington event. Lenz and I put on our mentor hats, Kevin Ingersoll participated in a team, and Coco the domain dog lent moral support by snoozing blissfully throughout. So imagine our excitement when the judges announced that Kevin's team had [scored a well-earned win](https://twitter.com/kingersoll)!

The thrills of Startup Weekend were soon followed by intellectual debate and thorough workshopping of the open source paradigm at the [Open Source Open Society conference](http://opensourceopensociety.com/) held in conjunction with Github and Enspiral. We employ open source technologies and open thinking [throughout our business](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/03/does-open-source-contribute-to-a-more-open-society.html), so it seemed like the perfect fit to help out. There was also a cool closing party with a funky, indie DJ on tap, so nobody wanted to leaveâ€”but that's another story.

We also remain keen backers of the PHP Meetup and JavaScript Meetup in our city and have been helping out with the R9 initiative, an experimental incubator aiming to solve important business problems in the government sector by using lean methodologies. Many of these events have our local tech business incubator [Creative HQ](http://creativehq.co.nz/) at their heart, so we're more than thrilled to be announcing a strategic partnership.

From this week on, we will be shouting the beers at the highly popular [Startup Garage](http://www.meetup.com/StartupGarage/) Meetup. Each month, Creative HQ hosts an interesting speaker from the start-up world, many of whom bring wisdom from afar. Recent appearances have included SXSW organiser Shawn O'Keefe and President of Y Combinator, Sam Altman. 

2015 is shaping up to be a big year for community involvement here at iwantmyname, and we're excited to make further inroads in the local start-up ecosystem. If you see us around, come say hi! We'd love to chat.
