<p>If there&#39;s one piece of advice we could give to someone who is starting a website or blog, it&#39;s that you should take some time to pick the right web platform for your needs. Some are great for blogging, some for e-commerce, some for being social. And there&#39;s always the option of creating something entirely custom—although you&#39;d either need some web development know-how or the resources to hire someone. Most sites though (including many of the biggest on the web) are created with one of the many platforms currently available. </p>

<p>For absolute beginners, we usually recommend a <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/website-builder/">hosted solution</a>—the platforms that bundle modern content management systems (CMS) with hosting space. They can cost a bit more, and you&#39;ll lose some development flexibility, but the benefits of using something that&#39;s truly plug-and-play often outweigh the lack of control. </p>

<p>But if you&#39;re comfortable managing your own hosting space, you&#39;re open to a whole world of platforms that give you control over even the smallest details. And the most popular of these platforms is <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (.org, not .com, which is a hosted platform), which in 2013 made up <a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/general-news/wordpress-infographic-2013-a-visual-representation-of-matts-state-of-the-word">18.9%</a> of the internet and was downloaded 46 million times.</p>

<p>If WordPress is something you&#39;re looking into, here&#39;s a rundown of how to link your iwantmyname domain to <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/iwantmyname/">Bluehost</a>, one of our favorite web hosts.</p>

<p><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/meet-the-new-domain-extensions-of-july.html">July</a> was a bit of a slow month for new generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches, with only four cracking the 5,000-registrations mark <a href="http://ntldstats.com/">so far</a>: <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-voting">.voting</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-services">.services</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kaufen">.kaufen</a>, and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-tokyo">.tokyo</a>, which is now the 20th most popular gTLD overall. But things may be looking up for August, with nine gTLDs containing less than five characters (it&#39;s thought that four or less may be the sweet spot for TLD popularity).</p>

<p>Especially interesting is the August 13th launch of four medical-specific gTLDs: <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-care">.care</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-clinic">.clinic</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-dental">.dental</a>, and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-surgery">.surgery</a>. The usefulness of being able to type in something like LOCATION.clinic to get a relevant result is undeniable, so it wouldn&#39;t be at all surprising to see some of these take off.</p>

<p>We&#39;re big fans of all the new generic top-level domains (TLDs) <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-launch-dates">coming out</a>, but we have a fascination of sorts with the extensions that are particularly off-kilter. The ones that probably won&#39;t be used for traditional company websites and blogs, but for strange creations and alternative microsites.</p>

<p>Next week, we have three launching—.fail, .rocks, and .wtf. And we don&#39;t really have any expectations on their registration numbers, but we&#39;re super interested in seeing what kinds of domains get created.</p>

		<p><a href="https://blog.digicert.com/expired-intermediate-certificate/">From Flavio Martins - DigiCert:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 26,2014 at 12:15 PM, some customers and users on sites secured by DigiCert reported that they were getting an untrusted certificate error.</p>

<p>The problem is related to a locally installed legacy intermediate certificate that is no longer used and no longer required for the certificate installation. The problem can affect any client platform with a locally cached or installed intermediate certificate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use (and really like) DigiCert for SSL, but it looks like there&#39;s been a minor hiccup for some users. If you&#39;re getting an untrusted certificate error when you visit iwantmyname, this is a great (and easy) step-by-step guide on how to fix it.</p>

<p>And if you need any additional help, definitely <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/support">let us know</a>. </p>

<p>We typically like to spare our customers the politics of the web, but Vint Cerf, the &quot;father of the internet&quot; (who now works for Google) recently narrated a great video explaining the transition of internet oversight from the influence of the NTIA (a US government organization) to the more global ICANN.</p>

<p>It&#39;s short, educational, and has a great frame at 2:22 where a drawn depiction of Vint Cerf is sitting on top of a giant angry cat under a rainbow (I believe he just won the internet). </p>

<p>We regularly post articles to help you get started with your own website, whether it&#39;s <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/a-detailed-breakdown-of-what-small-business-websites-cost.html">expected costs for a business site</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/07/build-a-modern-hosted-photo-gallery-website.html">how to economically showcase your photos</a>, or <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/squarespace-iwantmyname-makes-website-building-a-snap.html">really easy ways to get a domain and site up and running</a>. </p>

<p>But then what? In the same way that just buying a domain won&#39;t magically make a website appear, getting your website online won&#39;t magically make customers, audience, or community appear. As a side note, while SEO can be an important part of building your presence online, we&#39;re not going to get into it in this post, as that&#39;s a whole other big, complex topic. For an intro though, <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo">this is a great start</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at some things to think about and research. We&#39;ll also get into some actions to take to build your profile and engagement online and encourage people to visit your site. You could be trying to grow your customer base, build a community, or assemble an audience/fan base. People are people no matter how you&#39;re interacting with them, so these tactics can be broadly applied.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.donationto.com/">DonationTo</a> is an easy-to-use fundraising website that has <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/social/register-domain-donationto">integrated with iwantmyname</a> to make it easy to use personalized domain names when crowd-funding online. The method is rather easy—it takes just five minutes to create a fundraising page at DonationTo and just a few moments more to purchase and plug in your domain name with iwantmyname. And by the end, you&#39;ll have a great, easy-to-remember domain such as &#39;james-fighting-cancer.com&#39; as your hub for accepting donations.</p>

<p><a href="http://anyname.nz/">From anyname.nz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1pm, 30 September 2014, ‘second level’ domains like the .co in ‘.co.nz’ and the .org in ‘.org.nz’ will become optional. You’ll be able to get .nz names with them, without them, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In plain English, the .NZ domain extension will be open to the public on September 30th at 1pm (hooray!). And if you&#39;re a current owner of a .CO.NZ, .ORG.NZ, etc. domain, you&#39;ll have a two-year safe period to reserve your corresponding .NZ domain.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be sending out more specific details closer to the launch date, but in the meantime there are two things you can do. </p>
