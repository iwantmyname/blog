<p>There was a time when you could easily get free custom email addresses through Google, but those days have come and gone. Now if you want to set up a name@yourdomain.tld email address, you have to pay up like you&#39;re a business. Multiple users, vast amounts of space, tons of add-ons. But if you&#39;re just looking for something small that may or may not ever grow, having a freemium option is ideal. And for that, you should check out Zoho Mail.</p>

<p>In short, Zoho Mail offers <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing2.html">just about everything</a> gmail does, including lots of space, document storage and integration with productivity tools like calendars and task lists. Zoho Mail also has a webmail interface that works surprisingly well, and can easily be added to your favorite mail app for a more personalized workflow. Best of all though is the aforementioned free tier, with 5GB mail and document storage for up to 10 users (and it&#39;s ad-free).</p>

<p>So you&#39;re creating a review website, but like so many before you, finding a good .com that fits your brand name is nearly impossible. It&#39;s a difficult dilemma, because the last thing you want is to cripple your brand with a top-level domain that might come across as less than professional. But with hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out over the next few years, in addition to the list of country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) already available, people are naturally going to become more and more used to seeing things other than .com at the end of their favorite domains.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re ready to make the leap, here are some TLDs you should keep your eye on.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not comfortable contacting the domain owner directly, or you tried and didn&#39;t get a response, you can attempt to procure the domain when it expires. </p>

<p>This is anything but a guaranteed strategy, however. Most registrars remind their customers early and often prior to domains expiring. Most registrars also auto-renew domains by default as long as the customer&#39;s payment details are accurate and up to date. (<a href="http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184422">iwantmyname does both of these things for their customers.</a>)</p>

<p>Even if a domain&#39;s ownership does expire, many registrars give their customers a grace period after expiration so they can still renew it, sometimes at a considerably increased cost. (This pricing is set by the registries, not registrars like iwantmyname.)</p>

<p>You will need to follow the instructions outlined in <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp">ICANN&#39;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</a> (UDRP). Consulting a lawyer may also be useful in ensuring your case is as strong as possible. </p>

<p>Note, however, that even though you own the trademark, a domain squatter will still likely fight to keep the domain, since it was purchased in the first place to make money. Getting the domain name may be expensive, but if you own the trademark (or are a celebrity), you have a good chance of getting the domain from the squatter. Really, it comes down to whether it&#39;s worth the trouble to you.</p>

<p>Domain squatting (occasionally still called cybersquatting) typically happens for one of two reasons. </p>

<p>The owner could be holding the domain for a period of time to build up interest, then offer it for public sale in hopes of a bidding war. The owner could also be squatting to profit from the domain more immediately. This could be done by running a bunch of ads on a parking page, by offering the domain for rent to another entity (so you could use the domain and put up a site, but wouldn&#39;t own it), or by attempting to quickly sell the domain for much more than was paid for it. </p>

<p>Another domain squatting tactic is to buy expired domain names in the hopes that the owners let them expire by accident and will want them back, and are willing to pay a premium for them.</p>

<p>Having your own domain name, even if it&#39;s not perfect, is far more important than building your online presence on top of another service&#39;s URL, e.g. yourshop.shopify.com or facebook.com/yourcompany. This practice of building your brand, service or web presence on another organization&#39;s platform is an example of &quot;sharecropping&quot;. It can be problematic for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>The other platform you&#39;re hosted on controls how your presence can look or function (e.g. templates and tiered feature offerings depending on how much you pay). The other platform can change services or raise rates, leaving you little recourse since not accepting/paying could mean losing your site. </p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/domain-already-registered-pt1.html">the previous part of this post series</a>, you can look for a variant of &quot;theperfectdomain&quot;. But be aware of potential confusion if the domain extension (e.g. .NET / .GURU / .CA) is the only difference between your domain and someone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>You could try small changes to the domain name you want. Like adding or dropping an article. Instead of &quot;companyname&quot;, use &quot;thecompanyname&quot; or &quot;getproductname&quot;. Again, there is still a good chance people will get confused.</p>

<p>Instead of directly referring to your company, group, or topic name, you could focus on something relevant and important, like what the product or service enables you to do. A photographer could register a domain using &quot;shoot&quot; or &quot;snap&quot;, or referencing &quot;memories&quot;. A group of pilots could use &quot;fly&quot; or &quot;wings&quot; or &quot;soar&quot;. Using slang or terminology common among your group could make for a memorable domain name as well.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve started a business, a club or a blog. You&#39;ve got plenty of work ahead of you, and you&#39;re excited about it. Your idea is fantastic, you&#39;ve got so much you want to share with the world, and most importantly, you&#39;ve picked out a fantastic name. It&#39;s clever, descriptive and easy to remember. Now to register the domain name.</p>

<p>Or not.</p>

<p>Trying to get The Perfect Domain can be really frustrating. Or, at the very least, really expensive. <a href="http://www.thedomains.com/2014/03/24/after-losing-over-25000-registrations-in-two-days-com-back-below-113-million-berlin-top-40k/">Well over 100 million .COM domains are currently registered.</a> Which means  that &quot;the good ones&quot; are probably taken. Estimates are that the total number of registered domains topped a quarter of a <em>billion</em> last year. (Estimates are that nearly half consist of <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/com-domain-name-registration-for-commercial">.COM</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/net-domain-name-registration-for-network">.NET</a>.) </p>

<p>Plus, there doesn&#39;t even have to be an associated website for a domain name to be registered and unavailable to you. What&#39;s a person to do in the quest to register the perfect domain name? Well, there are a few options, which we&#39;ll break down for you in this series on what to do if the domain you want is already registered.</p>

<p>I went through a little exercise yesterday while trying to find a great domain name for a side project. Nothing too scientific, but the whole process reminded me of how hard it is to settle on a single domain for a brand. Do you go with relevant keywords? Throw caution to the wind and select something obscure? Use a new generic top-level domain (gTLD)?</p>

<p>For this example, let&#39;s go through the naming process for an imaginary tech review blog.</p>

<p>103 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">available on iwantmyname</a> now, and nearly 900,000 gTLD domains have been registered throughout the web since the big launch. May saw quite a bit of growth as far as gTLDs go, but June may be the biggest one yet with the launch of 27 new domain extensions, including .XYZ, .REVIEWS, .EVENTS, .SOCIAL and .DATING. Check out the full list below.</p>
