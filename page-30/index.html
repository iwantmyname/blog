<p>There&#39;s really no way around it anymore (unless you&#39;re a mega-company like Apple)—social media is kind of a necessary tool for doing business. It lets you interact with people using your products, and it gives you a pretty huge soapbox to talk to the world. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s an interesting balance you face when mixing general conversations with support questions, important messages and links to posts and new pages. How much is too much? What clicks with your audience? What&#39;s the science behind all this madness?</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		




	

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This guide is for transferring gTLDs only.</p>

<p>First, a definition. In the world of domain registrars, the term TLD stands for Top Level Domain—basically, the bit at the end of your domain name. More granularly, a generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) is part of a group of extensions including .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .name and .mobi.</p>

<p>Based on ICANN policy, all gTLDs require the same transfer process, which is different from country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs)—some more significantly than others. So if you&#39;re looking to transfer your gTLD—.com .net .org .info, .biz, .name or .mobi—to iwantmyname, please follow this guide.</p>

<p>Recently we uprooted the entire the entire team from Wellington and took up residence for a fortnight on a balmy tropical island not too distant from our shores. Make no mistake it wasn&#39;t all beer and skittles, there was plenty of code written, strategising done and overdue admin sorted. It&#39;s just a whole lot more fun working by the beach in your shorts with an ice cold pineapple juice near at hand.</p>

<p><strong>iwmn:</strong> Hi Tim. First off, I love your website, <a href="http://www.dot-kiwi.com">dot-kiwi.com</a>. The design is nice, the copy is fun, but once .kiwi goes live, do you plan on switching domain extensions. Maybe to something like dot.kiwi?</p>

<p><strong>Tim:</strong> Thanks! The website is a result of a lot of thought and planning - we want to break industry standards (boring), and reach out to the consumer with a fun and innovative interface that brings life to domain names. We look forward to changing from our current .com URL to one of our very own .kiwi names - what will it be? Well that&#39;s going to be a surprise....</p>

	<p>From Christine Willett - <a href="http://blog.icann.org/2013/10/first-new-gtlds-get-the-green-light-for-delegation/">ICANN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The time has come! Today, the first four domains from ICANN&#39;s New Generic Top-Level Domains Program were cleared to proceed to delegation. This marks the start of a measured roll out of new gTLDs, which are designed to expand opportunities for businesses, communities and Internet users around the world.</p>

<p>These first new gTLDs, or strings, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>شبكة (xn--ngbc5azd) - the Arabic word for &quot;Web&quot; or &quot;Network&quot;
Registry : International Domain Registry Pty. Ltd.</li>
<li>онлайн (xn--80asehdb) - Russian for &quot;Online&quot;
Registry: Core Association</li>
<li>сайт (xn--80aswg) - Russian for &quot;Web site&quot;
Registry: Core Association</li>
<li>游戏 (xn--unup4y) - Chinese for &quot;Game&quot;
Registry: Spring Fields, LLC</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is amazing news, as we&#39;ll soon be seeing more and more gTLDs (i.e. generic domain extensions like .blog and .music) roll out to the public. You can already subscribe to updates on the above mentioned top-level domains <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD">.онлайн</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82">.сайт</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%D8%B4%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%A9">.شبكة</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F">.游戏</a>—we will notify as soon as further information about final launch dates and pricing comes to hand. For a more complete list of the gTLDs coming out, check out <a href="http://theresatldforthat.com">theresatldforthat.com</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something refreshing about blogging on a platform meant for blogging. I mean, platforms like Tumblr and Squarespace provide a nice array of writing tools and readability themes, but if you&#39;re simply looking to blog without distracting bells and whistles, a platform like Silvrback is definitely what you&#39;re looking for. </p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve gone through <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/getting-started-with-tumblr-iwantmyblog.html">setting up</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2013/10/adventures-in-writing-on-tumblr-iwantmyblog.html">writing on</a> your Tumblr blog (Tumblog), we need to work on making it your own.</p>

<p>So what makes Tumblr one of the most attractive platforms for ADD bloggers (aside from the plethora of posting options) is that the community is quite active and ready to contribute—meaning that there are plenty of themes available, free and paid. Here are a few good sites for finding the one that&#39;s right for you:</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		




	

<p>So here&#39;s the origin of the problem*. When Twitter launched not that long ago (can you believe it only started in 2006?), they chose to limit posts to 140 characters. For many, that 140 character limit created a perfect environment for short thoughts and conversations, but it was a nightmare for posting links. I mean, just look at a fairly short link like <code>https://iwantmyname.com/blog/</code>. That&#39;s at least a million characters (29).</p>

<p>Quickly, it became very important to keep these links short. Really short. And by 2009, Twitter started using bitly as their link shortener of choice (they&#39;ve since started using t.co for all sites, which doesn&#39;t exactly have a custom ring to it).</p>

<p>For most users, a bitly link looks something like this: bit.ly/xxxxxxx. Basically, it turned any 25+ character link into something around 15. But why would a person or company choose to use bit.ly/xxxxxxx as opposed to something custom. Something branded. For these savvy entities that wanted a branded solution, bitly started offering <a href="http://support.bitly.com/knowledgebase/articles/76740-what-s-a-custom-short-domain-and-why-do-i-want-on">custom link shortening</a>. </p>

<p>At some point in the late 90s/early 2000s, hacking got a really bad rap, but to most of the development community, there&#39;s nothing malicious about it. Hacking just means using using a bunch of readily available tools to make something cool—like modifying code to make things faster or using pre-existing platforms to build new website functions. In a way, modern hacking is just the newer, nerdier version of tuning cars to get more horsepower or training dogs to get drinks out of the fridge. </p>

<p>Ok, that last one was a stretch.</p>

<p>But of all the hacks possible on the web, nothing is as accessible (or immediately gratifying) as a domain hack.</p>
