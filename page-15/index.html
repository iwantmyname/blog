	<p>Anyone who has ever put down for a high quality website knows the costs associated. You&#39;re paying for planning, hosting, design, strategy, and all sorts of other minute details that go into creating a polished domain. But getting an idea of what those costs will look like can be hard—here&#39;s a good place to start. </p>

<p>Big life events tend to be accompanied by countless images of every important moment, but in today&#39;s digital world, what happens after that? You&#39;re probably not going to print them all for a book, and uploading them all to large photo-storage sites seems rather impersonal. For photos like these, you need something you can customize to fit your style without any sort of platform branding slapped on top, with optional password protection for privacy if you need it. And of course it shoud also work with your very own custom domain name.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a ton of great options available. Some edgy and modern, and some more flexible and subdued. And best of all, they&#39;re not going to cost you a fortune to maintain. For $10 USD or less, you can create something quite amazing.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://ntldstats.com/tld">new generic top-level (gTLDs) domain stats</a>, it&#39;s clear that a number of the new domain extensions are merely flashes in the pan. Some, like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.club</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.guru</a> are doing well, but niche gTLDs like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-archi">.archi</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-qpon">.qpon</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-blackfriday">.blackfriday</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-christmas">.christmas</a> may need some time and luck to gain traction.</p>

<p>But one category makes a lot of sense for local residents and businesses, and also has a basis for success the other gTLDs don&#39;t have—cities. Around the world (aside from the US), county-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are hugely popular, with .co.uk domain extension registrations in particular numbering well into the millions. And that sort of localized naming scheme seems to translate well to cities, with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin">.Berlin</a> currently sitting as the second most popular gTLD currently available. </p>

<p>First, some perspective. In order for the new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) to become mainstream, there needs to be a rapid rise in popularity. <a href="http://ntldstats.com/">1.4 million total registrations</a> is a nice start (the new gTLD are only a few months old), but .com has 100 million domains under its umbrella. It&#39;s so big, in fact, that .com is synonymous with the internet for much of the world—but it may not always be that way. </p>

<p><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz">.Xyz</a>, billed as the natural ending for everything (because it&#39;s the end of the alphabet), has hit the <a href="http://ntldstats.com/tld/xyz">250,000 domains registered mark</a>, now making up nearly 18% of all the new gTLDs in existance. There have been some pretty egregious instances of stat manipulation, but looking at the bigger picture, the rise of .xyz (and the fact that people are talking about it) makes it seem possible for a number of these gTLDs to catch on. </p>

<p>New generic top-level domains (gTLDs) have been coming out at a rapid pace the last few months, and now there are nearly 1.4 million registered gTLDs in existance (up from less than a million on June 1). Looking at the <a href="http://ntldstats.com/">30</a> most popular, it&#39;s still apparent that the average gTLD is still fairly small (#30 <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-training">.training</a> only has around 9,000 registrations), but the top of the list has grown dramatically. Both <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-xyz">.xyz</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-berlin">.berlin</a> have more than 100,000 registered domains, and previous leaders <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.club</a> and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.guru</a> have more than 60,000.</p>

<p>Perhaps we&#39;ll see a new favorite from the new July domains though. Maybe .tokyo will go on to rival .berlin. Or maybe .blackfriday (??) will capture the hearts of retailers looking to cash in on the big day. Check out the launch calendar for July and find your favorites.</p>

<p>One of the first things people tend to do as soon as they set up websites is install some kind of analytics platform. Some people choose paid platforms like <a href="http://clicky.com/">Clicky</a> and <a href="https://www.gosquared.com/">GoSquared</a>, but most choose <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, the completely free platform that does just about everything you could ever want an analytics platform to do. </p>

<p>And there lies the problem—what the heck are people supposed to do with analytics? Sure, it&#39;s fun to see what parts of the world users are coming from and what pages are being read more than others, but the amount of data you can gather from Google Analytics is astounding. If you know what you&#39;re doing...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalbydesign.com/2014/06/26/gmail-non-latin-email-addresses/">From John Yunker - Global by Design:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the ICANN 50 conference Jordyn Buchanan of Google confirmed that Gmail would support EAI (email address internationalization) by the end of this month.</p>

<p>I don’t have the details yet, but at a minimum I assume it means a Gmail user could create an email address using a non-Latin label, such as [RussianName]@gmail.com. And this address would work with others on the Gmail platform, though not other email platforms. And this is not because Google doesn’t want to work with other platforms, but because there are so many mail servers involved in successfully delivering email.</p>

<p>But assuming that this is full EAI support, then the user could also use a complete non-Latin email address, such as [RussianName]@[RussianDomain].</p>

<p>Back in January we <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html">wrote an article</a> informing everyone of ICANN&#39;s new rules for verifying contact information. To recap, &quot;When you register a domain with new contact details, transfer existing domains or change the registrant (owner) or email address on your contact information, you will receive an additional email with an activation link. <strong>If you don&#39;t press this link, your domain will be disabled after 15 days</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>As a domain registrar, rules like these are quite scary because we&#39;re the point of contact when things go wrong, and there&#39;s really nothing we can do to fix an ICANN-suspended domain other than point customers to their verification error landing pages. Our hope was that the process would go smoothly for our customers (and thankfully we haven&#39;t had too many issues), but it seems to be a pretty big issue for the internet at large. </p>
