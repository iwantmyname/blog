<p>One of the first things people tend to do as soon as they set up websites is install some kind of analytics platform. Some people choose paid platforms like <a href="http://clicky.com/">Clicky</a> and <a href="https://www.gosquared.com/">GoSquared</a>, but most choose <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, the completely free platform that does just about everything you could ever want an analytics platform to do. </p>

<p>And there lies the problem—what the heck are people supposed to do with analytics? Sure, it&#39;s fun to see what parts of the world users are coming from and what pages are being read more than others, but the amount of data you can gather from Google Analytics is astounding. If you know what you&#39;re doing...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalbydesign.com/2014/06/26/gmail-non-latin-email-addresses/">From John Yunker - Global by Design:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the ICANN 50 conference Jordyn Buchanan of Google confirmed that Gmail would support EAI (email address internationalization) by the end of this month.</p>

<p>I don’t have the details yet, but at a minimum I assume it means a Gmail user could create an email address using a non-Latin label, such as [RussianName]@gmail.com. And this address would work with others on the Gmail platform, though not other email platforms. And this is not because Google doesn’t want to work with other platforms, but because there are so many mail servers involved in successfully delivering email.</p>

<p>But assuming that this is full EAI support, then the user could also use a complete non-Latin email address, such as [RussianName]@[RussianDomain].</p>

<p>Back in January we <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/01/icanns-new-rules-for-domain-registrants-require-you-to-verify-your-contact-details.html">wrote an article</a> informing everyone of ICANN&#39;s new rules for verifying contact information. To recap, &quot;When you register a domain with new contact details, transfer existing domains or change the registrant (owner) or email address on your contact information, you will receive an additional email with an activation link. <strong>If you don&#39;t press this link, your domain will be disabled after 15 days</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>As a domain registrar, rules like these are quite scary because we&#39;re the point of contact when things go wrong, and there&#39;s really nothing we can do to fix an ICANN-suspended domain other than point customers to their verification error landing pages. Our hope was that the process would go smoothly for our customers (and thankfully we haven&#39;t had too many issues), but it seems to be a pretty big issue for the internet at large. </p>

<p>Creating a sustainable company is a victory in and of itself, but growth is always cause for celebration. And today, we&#39;re celebrating the 10th member of the iwantmyname team—Travis Holton. </p>

<p>Travis comes to New Zealand by way of the US and Germany (where he spent some time working with Lenz and Manu in Starnberg), and brings with him a host of software development experience. He specializes in Object Oriented Design, Python, Perl and JavaScript, but has worked with and can adapt to anything we&#39;ll be throwing at him. He also has half-a-decade of experience in the domain industry, so his blend of prior knowledge and current skills will be incredibly useful for our future growth. </p>

<p>There was a time when you could easily get free custom email addresses through Google, but those days have come and gone. Now if you want to set up a name@yourdomain.tld email address, you have to pay up like you&#39;re a business. Multiple users, vast amounts of space, tons of add-ons. But if you&#39;re just looking for something small that may or may not ever grow, having a freemium option is ideal. And for that, you should check out Zoho Mail.</p>

<p>In short, Zoho Mail offers <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing2.html">just about everything</a> gmail does, including lots of space, document storage and integration with productivity tools like calendars and task lists. Zoho Mail also has a webmail interface that works surprisingly well, and can easily be added to your favorite mail app for a more personalized workflow. Best of all though is the aforementioned free tier, with 5GB mail and document storage for up to 10 users (and it&#39;s ad-free).</p>

<p>So you&#39;re creating a review website, but like so many before you, finding a good .com that fits your brand name is nearly impossible. It&#39;s a difficult dilemma, because the last thing you want is to cripple your brand with a top-level domain that might come across as less than professional. But with hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) coming out over the next few years, in addition to the list of country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) already available, people are naturally going to become more and more used to seeing things other than .com at the end of their favorite domains.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re ready to make the leap, here are some TLDs you should keep your eye on.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not comfortable contacting the domain owner directly, or you tried and didn&#39;t get a response, you can attempt to procure the domain when it expires. </p>

<p>This is anything but a guaranteed strategy, however. Most registrars remind their customers early and often prior to domains expiring. Most registrars also auto-renew domains by default as long as the customer&#39;s payment details are accurate and up to date. (<a href="http://help.iwantmyname.com/customer/portal/articles/184422">iwantmyname does both of these things for their customers.</a>)</p>

<p>Even if a domain&#39;s ownership does expire, many registrars give their customers a grace period after expiration so they can still renew it, sometimes at a considerably increased cost. (This pricing is set by the registries, not registrars like iwantmyname.)</p>

<p>You will need to follow the instructions outlined in <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp">ICANN&#39;s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</a> (UDRP). Consulting a lawyer may also be useful in ensuring your case is as strong as possible. </p>

<p>Note, however, that even though you own the trademark, a domain squatter will still likely fight to keep the domain, since it was purchased in the first place to make money. Getting the domain name may be expensive, but if you own the trademark (or are a celebrity), you have a good chance of getting the domain from the squatter. Really, it comes down to whether it&#39;s worth the trouble to you.</p>

<p>Domain squatting (occasionally still called cybersquatting) typically happens for one of two reasons. </p>

<p>The owner could be holding the domain for a period of time to build up interest, then offer it for public sale in hopes of a bidding war. The owner could also be squatting to profit from the domain more immediately. This could be done by running a bunch of ads on a parking page, by offering the domain for rent to another entity (so you could use the domain and put up a site, but wouldn&#39;t own it), or by attempting to quickly sell the domain for much more than was paid for it. </p>

<p>Another domain squatting tactic is to buy expired domain names in the hopes that the owners let them expire by accident and will want them back, and are willing to pay a premium for them.</p>
