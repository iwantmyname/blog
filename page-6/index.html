<p>It’s never more apparent how puzzling domain names are to people than when I get asked about my job. “A domain registrar? What the heck is that?” I get it all the time, but what surprises me most is that many of these same people already own domains in some form or another—usually brokered through legacy web-design firms charging $20-30/mo for Flash websites with glitzy visitor counters (seriously, if you&#39;re paying $30/mo for a site built a decade ago, you&#39;re getting ripped off).</p>

<p>So my goal of goals is to set them on the right path, usually with an abridged version of this very post—my spiel on domain names, what you’re buying, what the deal is with all the new domain extensions, what email has to do with it all, and a bit about Whois privacy.</p>

<p>Let me start this article by confessing that we’re not SEO gurus at iwantmyname. Everything we&#39;ve done in the last few years in terms of SEO was done with a basic understanding of the topic and by providing a good product with relevant content and landing pages. This always served us well and we were happy with our rankings overall. With that out of the way, I’d like to tell you about our experience with switching our blog to a subdomain. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the arrival of hundreds of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs), many marketers are excited that they can now get a web address that best describes their business or brand. For instance, a company in the organic business can now get a web address on .ORGANIC, or a brand that&#39;s all about passion and excitement can now get on .RED, etc. At the same time, many are also asking some important SEO related questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will Google crawl new gTLDs?</li>
<li>Will new gTLDs automatically score higher in Google&#39;s search algorithms?</li>
<li>What are the SEO best practices for migrating a site to a new gTLD?</li>
<li>Should brands REALLY get on new gTLDs and give up the status quo?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s address them one by one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s pretty much common knowledge that GMail is awesome. It’s fast, connects seamlessly with the rest of your Google services such as Drive, has a cool app called Inbox, and is overall an extremely powerful email service. However, to use it with a custom domain, you need to purchase Google Apps for either $5 or $10/month, which for casual users is a bit unnecessary. On top of that, you don’t even get all of the features a personal account gets, e.g. Inbox.</p>

<p>However, there’s a free way to use your GMail account with a custom domain: Mailgun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neat trick for more advanced users to set up custom domain email using a standard Gmail account and <a href="http://mailgun.com">Mailgun</a> (for up to 10,000 emails a month). <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/06/yes-you-can-still-get-free-custom-email-addresses.html">Yes, you can still get free custom domain email addresses</a> — even in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/">From The Name Inspector:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Name Inspector has been reflecting on last year’s startup names while sipping on what’s left of the apple peel bourbon he made for the holidays. He’s got to say, it seems like some of these companies were named by people who sipped lots of bourbon. Here are some weird names of startups in CrunchBase that were founded in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember when Nirvana (the band) first started getting played on the radio. Most of my friends were really into the music, but all I could think was “I’m pretty sure I have what it takes to sing incomprehensible lyrics, too! I’m definitely going to be a rock star.” And sure, naming your brand is a whole lot different than singing songs, but the message is similar—extreme talent aside, Nirvana was a success because they actually made music. I wasn’t because I was too worried about everything to ever get on stage.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to say, and what a lot of the startups mentioned in <a href="http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/">the article</a> prove, is that you shouldn’t let branding uncertainty (or even wackiness) prevent you from doing what you want to do. Sure, maybe you think it’s a mistake to name a brand <em>AssessUp</em> or <em>KeeeWeee</em>, but look at all these brands. They exist...they’re real companies with profiles on CrunchBase! You just never know what might become the next big household brand.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new year, so let&#39;s talk a bit about domain discounts. This month, we have a host of sales carrying over from December, plus two location-based TLDs moonlighting as cultural favorites. .Vegas, hailing from the US city of Las Vegas, is synonymous on the web (and elsewhere) with gambling culture, and will likely draw interest with gaming sites and travel microsites. And .Asia, the world&#39;s largest continent, is attempting to bring online nations together for business and trade. </p>

<p>Take a look at 2015&#39;s first domain discount list, and start the new year right with a shiny new online space.</p>

<p>2014 is done, folks. Our new gTLD catalogue is now filled with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">257 new generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a>, including the ever-popular <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-club">.club</a>, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-link">.link</a>, and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-guru">.guru</a> (and of course, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-kiwi">.kiwi</a>), and we have a ton more to come in 2015. </p>

<p>Now the big question...has the new gTLD launch been a success? Well, it depends what your metric is. .Xyz recently hit the 750,000 domains registered mark, making it the most registered new gTLD out there, and as Peter Roesler of Inc. <a href="http://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/will-new-top-level-domains-matter-in-2015.html">put it</a>, &quot;If you want to use one of the new TLDs to build a site with an easy-to-remember name, you won&#39;t be disappointed&quot;. Sure, the registration numbers aren&#39;t to the level of .com yet, but I think any gTLD registry owner would tell you it&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. </p>

<p>In 2015, I&#39;d expect to see steady gTLD growth as more people become aware of their existence (if the general public knew about the glorious <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/dot-pizza">.pizza</a> extension, we&#39;d see an online pizza renaissance for sure). And with another year of new launches, paired with the ever-dwindling supply of good remaining .coms, the growth might be faster than people expect. </p>

<p>Prognostication aside, we have a big year of gTLDs ahead of us, and it all begins with the 11 new extensions we&#39;re launching this month. </p>

		<p>I’ve never resold or purchased a domain on an aftermarket in my life, but hearing stories about that side of the domain industry is vastly entertaining. There’s intrigue, secret internet dealings, big characters, big egos—it’s all there. And this week, one of my favorite new podcasts, Reply All, covered Longform.org’s attempt to purchase their corresponding .com from Michael Berkens, reseller extraordinaire and founder of The Domains. It’s a good one—give it a listen.</p>

<p>(Just a heads up...if you’re easily offended, there are a couple curse words in this episode. Nothing big, but they’re there.)</p>

<p>There are very few certainties in life—death, taxes, the fact that eggs always taste better with a dash of hot sauce, and that on January 1st, the little numbers in the year will change ever so slightly. </p>

<p>Pre-internet, this wasn’t such a big deal. Sure, you might write the wrong year on a check or document, but it wasn’t an error the world would have to see on a daily basis. Not like on a website, where nearly all the footers in existence—the big footers, small footers, dark footers, and light footers—share one tiny trait. © 2014.</p>

<p>I say “nearly” because every year there are those who forget to manually change the year from one to the next. It’s a bit of a minor tragedy, but entirely understandable. Fortunately, Mikko Järvenpää has your back, with a clever site called <a href="http://updateyourfooter.com">updateyourfooter.com</a>. </p>
