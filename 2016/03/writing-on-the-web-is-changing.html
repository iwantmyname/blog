					<h1>Writing on the web, as an individual, is changing (probably for the better)</h1>
				

				

				<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when building a grand personal website sounded like a great idea. People – regular people – were committing a few hours a day to it, and actually making money. But somewhere around the middle of the 2000&rsquo;s, social media got big, people started expressing themselves with shortform content, and consistently writing medium-to-longform posts became a major chore.</p>

<p>Now, when I go and poll my friends and coworkers, the ones who still have traditional blogs are almost all living with a touch of guilt. Their online castles are outdated, their latest posts are collecting cobwebs, and the majority of their real writing is either going to their work or their social media accounts. (BTW, if this describes you, Timo recently <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html">wrote a great post</a> about some alternative things you can do with your domain(s).)</p>

<p>But blogging isn&rsquo;t dead. Far from it. It&rsquo;s just different. Sure, there are those who still have dedicated personal blogs, but the newest trend is to push infrequent content to platforms that already have a huge reach, like Medium. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/03/medium-plans-publisher-monetization-within-a-month-considers-paywalls-and-premium-content/">recent quote</a> from Medium founder, Ev Williams,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think publishers who are experimenting with Medium are seeing a world where it’s not about having a website,” said Williams. “There are not going to be tens of millions of websites that lots of people go to every day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Medium offers is a way for people to write what they want with a solid CMS, on a platform that takes style decisions away from the author. That probably sounds terrible to some, but for many people, it&rsquo;s a way to express themselves without having to worry about the stuff they&rsquo;re not good at. Just write something up, hit publish, and let people read. Once they&rsquo;re done, they won&rsquo;t judge you for not updating often enough or having an outdated site, they&rsquo;ll just hit next and read one of the other million posts Medium has to offer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I see it. The dream of the internet is to be able to share yourself – your ideas, your art, your dreams – with like-minded peope everywhere. It connects us. But what we&rsquo;ve learned is that not everyone needs a castle for their personal thoughts. A castle requires a ton of upkeep. Instead, a lot of us might just need a small house to store stuff in. If you&rsquo;re writing tweets, Facebook posts, Medium entries, taking pictures with Instagram, and trying out a handful of other platforms, you probably don&rsquo;t need a personal blog on a personal website to feel guilty about not keeping up with. All you need is a little <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2016/03/struggling-to-update-your-site.html#section-3">one-pager</a> that links to all the things you do so you can keep track of it all.</p>

<p>Writing a new resume and need to find that link to that great post you wrote last year? With a good one-pager, it&rsquo;ll be easy to find. Can&rsquo;t remember what photo app that good picture of your dog is on? With a good one-pager, it&rsquo;ll be easy to find. Want to direct a new friend, client, or employer to a place where they can see all the work you do without needing to sift through ten different web platforms? One-pager. Seriously.</p>

<p>To sum this up (I like a good, clear takeaway), stop feeling guilty, as I always do, about spending your time writing on platforms that aren&rsquo;t owned and designed by you. Getting your thoughts out there is more important than worrying about the authenticity of writing on a personal blog. If you want a blog, great! But if you just feel like writing every once in a while, publish it anywhere! Just, for the sake of not writing something you&rsquo;ll forget about in a year, get a little website that links to your stuff wherever it&rsquo;s posted.</p>
