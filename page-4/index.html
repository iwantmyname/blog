	<p>Actually getting your own website with your own domain name online can be a bit like exploring a foreign land. Navigating uncharted territory, trying to decipher unfamiliar language. Creating a web presence is not for the weak.</p>

<p>At iwantmyname, we&rsquo;ve put a lot of work into trying to make that process as painless as possible. And now, with designer <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2015/01/say-hi-to-the-newest-iwantmynamer-kevin-layshock.html">Kevin</a> on board, we&rsquo;re hoping to make even greater strides in user experience friendliness.</p>

<p>One thing some people still sometimes struggle with, though, is just how to get a website up and running. If only it all happened by magic as soon as your domain was registered!</p>

<p>Generic top-level domain (gTLD) launches have gotten off to a bit of a slow start in 2015, but the overall stats are looking more impressive by the day. According to <a href="https://ntldstats.com">ntldstats.com</a>, there are now 4,121,213 new gTLDs registered (a nearly 400,000 jump from Jan 1), and <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">so many options to choose from</a>—there&rsquo;s literally never been a better time than today to get a unique domain with your brand name.</p>

<p>This month, we have eight new domain extensions, including .yoga, .work, and .energy. It&rsquo;s hard to predict individual TLD popularity because of the abundant options available, but some industry specific options (like .delivery for home delivery startups) have done pretty well in niche markets.</p>

	<p>Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&rsquo;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.</p>

		<p>Naming and choosing domains often go hand-in-hand, but many don&rsquo;t take either as seriously as they probably should. To get a glimpse of the professional naming process, take a gander at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/the-weird-science-of-naming-new-products.html?_r=0">&ldquo;The Weird Science of Naming New Products&rdquo;</a> by Neal Gabler of the New York Times Magazine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea is to do everything — to leave no word unturned. He visits the website onelook.com, which shows how words work with other words, or sketchengine.co.uk, which combs texts and concordances, flags parts of speech and shows how a specific word appears in billions of words of text. He visits rhymezone.com to find all the words that rhyme with a word. That is how he came up with the name for an ideation application for the Palm Pilot — he began with “brain,” looked for rhyming words and concluded with BrainForest. For this project, he thought of words about travel, but also about entertainment, the sense of engagement, connection, energy, even spheres. And he laid them all out on an Excel spreadsheet — 1,200 names in all by the time he had finished.</p>

<p>For a single project, namers can come up with as many as 6,500 names. Big naming companies will do anywhere from 40 to 50 projects a year, and smaller ones 15 to 20, which adds up to a lot of names. Of course, only one name will be chosen for each project, and that is the only one the client will own. The rest, however, won’t necessarily go to waste. Every naming agency keeps a list of its discards in a computer program. These are then classified by message (at Catchword); by distinctiveness, appeal, memorability and concept (at Interbrand); or by whatever other way the namers might want to retrieve them. Catchword has 650 of these categorized lists. And many of the names will be recycled, which suggests that there is a kind of Platonic ideal of good names, independent of products good or bad — a name so good that it could work, if not on anything, than at least on many things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now clearly many (if not most) people/brands can&rsquo;t afford the premium costs of naming firms, but we should all strive to dig a bit deeper into our brands and ideals before coming up with names (if you don&rsquo;t have at least 100 ideas on paper, you&rsquo;re probably not trying hard enough). Just another something to add to your 2015 resolutions list.</p>

	<p>It’s never more apparent how puzzling domain names are to people than when I get asked about my job. “A domain registrar? What the heck is that?” I get it all the time, but what surprises me most is that many of these same people already own domains in some form or another—usually brokered through legacy web-design firms charging $20-30/mo for Flash websites with glitzy visitor counters (seriously, if you&rsquo;re paying $30/mo for a site built a decade ago, you&rsquo;re getting ripped off).</p>

<p>So my goal of goals is to set them on the right path, usually with an abridged version of this very post—my spiel on domain names, what you’re buying, what the deal is with all the new domain extensions, what email has to do with it all, and a bit about Whois privacy.</p>

	<p>Let me start this article by confessing that we’re not SEO gurus at iwantmyname. Everything we&rsquo;ve done in the last few years in terms of SEO was done with a basic understanding of the topic and by providing a good product with relevant content and landing pages. This always served us well and we were happy with our rankings overall. With that out of the way, I’d like to tell you about our experience with switching our blog to a subdomain. </p>

	<p><a href="http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/">From The Name Inspector:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Name Inspector has been reflecting on last year’s startup names while sipping on what’s left of the apple peel bourbon he made for the holidays. He’s got to say, it seems like some of these companies were named by people who sipped lots of bourbon. Here are some weird names of startups in CrunchBase that were founded in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember when Nirvana (the band) first started getting played on the radio. Most of my friends were really into the music, but all I could think was “I’m pretty sure I have what it takes to sing incomprehensible lyrics, too! I’m definitely going to be a rock star.” And sure, naming your brand is a whole lot different than singing songs, but the message is similar—extreme talent aside, Nirvana was a success because they actually made music. I wasn’t because I was too worried about everything to ever get on stage.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to say, and what a lot of the startups mentioned in <a href="http://www.thenameinspector.com/weird-startup-names-of-2014/">the article</a> prove, is that you shouldn’t let branding uncertainty (or even wackiness) prevent you from doing what you want to do. Sure, maybe you think it’s a mistake to name a brand <em>AssessUp</em> or <em>KeeeWeee</em>, but look at all these brands. They exist&hellip;they’re real companies with profiles on CrunchBase! You just never know what might become the next big household brand.</p>

	<p>There are very few certainties in life—death, taxes, the fact that eggs always taste better with a dash of hot sauce, and that on January 1st, the little numbers in the year will change ever so slightly.</p>

<p>Pre-internet, this wasn’t such a big deal. Sure, you might write the wrong year on a check or document, but it wasn’t an error the world would have to see on a daily basis. Not like on a website, where nearly all the footers in existence—the big footers, small footers, dark footers, and light footers—share one tiny trait. © 2014.</p>

<p>I say “nearly” because every year there are those who forget to manually change the year from one to the next. It’s a bit of a minor tragedy, but entirely understandable. Fortunately, Mikko Järvenpää has your back, with a clever site called <a href="http://updateyourfooter.com">updateyourfooter.com</a>.</p>

In the last year, we upped our <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/about">team</a> size to ten, passed the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/celebrating-100000-domains-at-iwantmyname.html">100,000 domains registered</a> mark (and beyond), added more than <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">250 new generic top-level domains</a> (gTLDs) to the list, and managed to keep our <a href="http://public.nicereply.com/iwantmyname">support satisfaction at 97%</a>. It’s really been incredible—so thank you, thank you, thank you. We can’t say it enough.</p>

	</h1>
	
	
	

	
		<p><img src="../media/2014-10-14-multicurrency.png" alt="Multicurrency"></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/">iwantmyname website</a> lately, you might&rsquo;ve noticed a change in parts of the site—a new multicurrency toggle. Now, instead of displaying prices (and accepting payments) in only USD (US Dollar), you can switch currencies to NZD (New Zealand Dollar), GBP (British Pound), AUD (Australian Dollar), and EUR (Euro). It&rsquo;s a small feature, but one we&rsquo;re really happy to roll out.</p>

<h3>A Little Backstory</h3>

<p>For the first half-decade of iwantmyname, implementing multicurrency through our upstream partner was simply too big a project for our team to handle. So, with the majority of our business coming through the US, we began our existence with USD as our payment standard.</p>

<p>But now we&rsquo;re a bit bigger, and our customers are a bit more spread out, so we&rsquo;ve officially launched our multicurrency expansion. We quietly launched it a few weeks ago, and we&rsquo;re really happy with how it&rsquo;s working (being based in New Zealand, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to pay in NZD).</p>

<hr>

<p>So next time you&rsquo;re looking for a domain, there are three ways to change your currency: in the footer (see screenshot below), on all our price lists (like <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/domain-name-registration-list-of-extensions">this one</a>), and in your account payment settings. We&rsquo;ve also set it up to be location aware, so new customers should automatically be assigned to their correct currency. Once switched, all prices on the site (minus the blog, which is currently static), should reflect the change.</p>

<p><img src="../media/2014-10-14-nzd.png" alt="NZD"></p>

<p>Also, if you have any questions about multicurrency, <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/support">feel free to ask</a>. We&rsquo;re always here to help.</p>
