		<p><a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/how-to-build-a-low-tech-internet.html">Kris De Decker on how to build a low-tech internet:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than half of the global population does not have access to the &ldquo;worldwide&rdquo; web. Up to now, the internet is mainly an urban phenomenon, especially in &ldquo;developing&rdquo; countries. Telecommunication companies are usually reluctant to extend their network outside cities due to a combination of high infrastructure costs, low population density, limited ability to pay for services, and an unreliable or non-existent electricity infrastructure. Even in remote regions of &ldquo;developed&rdquo; countries, internet connectivity isn&rsquo;t always available.</p>

<p>Internet companies such as Facebook and Google regularly make headlines with plans for connecting these remote regions to the internet. Facebook tries to achieve this with drones, while Google counts on high-altitude balloons. There are major technological challenges, but the main objection to these plans is their commercial character. Obviously, Google and Facebook want to connect more people to the internet because that would increase their revenues. Facebook especially receives lots of criticism because their network promotes their own site in particular, and blocks most other internet applications.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several research groups and network enthusiasts have developed and implemented much cheaper alternative network technologies to solve these issues. Although these low-tech networks have proven their worth, they have received much less attention. Contrary to the projects of internet companies, they are set up by small organisations or by the users themselves. This guarantees an open network that benefits the users instead of a handful of corporations. At the same time, these low-tech networks are very energy efficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the past few months, a “very large fraction” of the millions of queries a second that people type into the company’s search engine have been interpreted by an artificial intelligence system, nicknamed RankBrain, said Greg Corrado, a senior research scientist with the company, outlining for the first time the emerging role of AI in search.</p>

<p>RankBrain uses artificial intelligence to embed vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities -- called vectors -- that the computer can understand. If RankBrain sees a word or phrase it isn’t familiar with, the machine can make a guess as to what words or phrases might have a similar meaning and filter the result accordingly, making it more effective at handling never-before-seen search queries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in the day I spent a lot of time thinking about SEO. I poured over SEO blogs, asked for advice on how I can improve my search results, and did everything in my power to game the (people-powered) Google system. But it&rsquo;s 2015. The computers are taking over. All that matters now is making sites that perform their intended task with the least resistance possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so written and spoken language are different. Does that make written language worse?</p>

<p>If you want people to read and understand what you write, yes. Written language is more complex, which makes it more work to read. It&rsquo;s also more formal and distant, which gives the reader&rsquo;s attention permission to drift. But perhaps worst of all, the complex sentences and fancy words give you, the writer, the false impression that you&rsquo;re saying more than you actually are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite is when arguments start in comment sections. They all start with similar troll statements followed by simple insults. But then they inevitably expand into a series of people trying to prove points with dissertation-style sentences that mean nothing. So many syllables, so little thought.</p>

<p>Then, in 2011, civil war broke out in Libya. One of the main registrars of .ly addresses, Libyan Spider, was shut down, apparently as part of UN/US sanctions on Libya. For a time, the owners of Libyan Spider were only able to revive these urls by leaving the country.</p>

<p>The start-up Letter.ly also announced that it had gone down because it had let its domain registration expire, and it could not establish contact with the registrar to renew it’s contract. “Sorry for the hassle,” they wrote in an email to their users. “it’s amazing that a physical war has affected our service in this way.”</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150716_where_has_the_domain_name_growth_gone/">Jay Dailey, Chief Executive of the .nz registry, on slowing domain name growth:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The impact of new gTLDs has been to solve the &lsquo;meaningfulness problem&rsquo; by the creation of hundreds of new gTLDs and this in turn directly affects the perception of scarcity. This reduction in scarcity is in turn reducing the incentive to speculate.</p>

<p>It is my assertion that this speculative behaviour has been a significant factor in historical growth and so domain name growth prospects are partly dependent on what happens to that behaviour. At the macro level, global speculative behaviour in domain names will reduce and the money will switch to a different scarce asset, permanently leaving our industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the foreseeable future people will need domain names to create things on the internet, so registrars will be fine (although the days of bananas growth might be over). But the owners of these new gTLDs are probably sweating a bit. Their <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/gtlds-whats-the-process-and-how-much-pay-icann-1392947/">$185,000 investments</a> might take much longer than expected to return a profit.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/21/choice-stressing-us-out-dating-partners-monopolies">Stuart Jeffries on the stress that choice induces:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time in Springfield, the Simpson family visited a new supermarket. Monstromart’s slogan was “where shopping is a baffling ordeal”. Product choice was unlimited, shelving reached the ceiling, nutmeg came in 12lb boxes and the express checkout had a sign reading, “1,000 items or less”. In the end the Simpsons returned to Apu’s Kwik-E-Mart.</p>

<p>In doing so, the Simpsons were making a choice to reduce their choice. It wasn’t quite a rational choice, but it made sense. In the parlance of economic theory, they were not rational utility maximisers but, in Herbert Simon’s term, “satisficers” – opting for what was good enough, rather than becoming confused to the point of inertia in front of Monstromart’s ranges of products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see how the domain industry, as a whole, is faring with <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">500+ (and counting) new gTLDs</a> on the shelves. (Sometimes I think we should just pick the top 25 and say, &ldquo;This is what we&rsquo;re selling because these are the good ones!&rdquo;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to protect privacy as a fundamental human right. We need a global Internet. We need to keep the public safe. And we need to find a legal path that will work on both sides of the Atlantic. We need to do all four of these things together and simultaneously. This is the privacy version of a Rubik’s Cube.</p>

<p>If we’re going to find a long-term and sustainable approach, we need to think afresh. The leading privacy law in the United States was adopted in 1986. The laws in Europe come from the same era. The approaches that were developed fifteen years before the 20th century ended are simply not adequate fifteen years after the 21st century began. It’s not just technology that has changed. The world has changed.</p>

	<p>A couple hundred years ago, it was possible to live and die leaving pretty much zero physical evidence of your existence. Except perhaps some kids. Today, though, someone with no identity footprint would be nearly unheard of. I&rsquo;m even skeptical of companies that don&rsquo;t have websites.</p>

<p>Now that so many of us have these broad digital presences — websites, email accounts, social media profiles, photos, videos, text — the footprints we leave behind may require some maintenance and planning. After all, your online self is as much a part of your life as your photo albums,  household items, and collectibles.</p>

<p>Beyond keeping payment details updated, domains renewed, passwords secure, etc., we need to consider life&rsquo;s &ldquo;what ifs?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;hit by a bus&rdquo; scenarios, as we&rsquo;ve called them at a few places I&rsquo;ve worked. What happens if you&rsquo;re not there tomorrow? Maybe you moved on to a new job, left a relationship, or actually were hit by a bus!</p>

	<p>The commonly told tale is that website building is for &ldquo;computer geniuses&rdquo; who&rsquo;ve been churning out complicated code for much of their waking lives. But it&rsquo;s not true. Sure, building a massive site for a global corporation is a huge undertaking, but the tools exist, right now, for small business owners of any computer skill level to quickly create beautiful sites and online stores.</p>

	<p>Math is hard. Running a marathon is hard. Writing on the web, no matter what anyone tells you, is not hard. In fact, it&rsquo;s become so easy that you pick up a following writing nothing more than 140 character messages riddled with abbreviated words, hashtags, and @ replies.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s hard is writing words that matter. Evergreen content. Posts that, in a decade, people will still be able to read and discuss. This kind of writing requires a bit of planning, a bit of structure, and a willingness to forego the immediate &ldquo;viral-ness&rdquo; of social media—but if you stick with it, you&rsquo;ll have a real collection of content that&rsquo;ll withstand the fickle nature of the social web.</p>
