				<p>Newsletters and blogs. Every corner of the internet seems to now be filled with newsletters and blogs in an ongoing competition for user attention. It&#39;s easy to take a cynical view and say that it’s all just unnecessary noise, but in a way, we’re all laying the groundwork for the future of how brands can communicate effectively in a marketplace where competition can literally be created overnight in a bedroom. The reality is that brand culture and the way it’s communicated is one of the last differentiating factors a company has (right after user experience and innovation, I’d say), so it’s hugely important.</p>

<p>But there’s a challenge. Digital startups today are looking to capture global audiences with smaller staffs, more competition, and leaner margins than the analog brands of yore. For example, here at iwantmyname, our current marketing/communications goal is to reach the entirety of the English-speaking world (and beyond) with 11 people and no giant marketing budget speak of. Basically, we&#39;ve almost exclusively leveraged word-of-mouth to reach customers/visitors in 234 countries (Google Analytics even says we got a visit from N. Korea?)...something we&#39;re extremely proud of, but it&#39;s a constant grind to spread our message of simplicity even further—in a sincere way.</p>

<h3>Sincerity in brand messaging</h3>

<p>Maybe I’m just a naive between-Millennial-and-Gen-Xer (Xennial?), but I often look at advertising as an insincere gesture. When I see display ads, I often think of them as giant billboards trying to subliminally make me like things (I don’t like you, but that cheeseburger looks delicious!). Social marketing is often the same—companies tweet mildly funny tidbits to their followers, hoping for some sort of delightful, friendly response. If their posts were personal notes or direct messages, they’d be charming, but it’s hard to be charmed by a message directed at no one.</p>

<p>There’s just so much noise. 10 tweets a day from each brand, three Facebook posts, display ads, news articles, sponsorships, appearances. As a consumer, I’m not looking for radio silence, I’m just yearning for a way to turn it off most of the week. I like to see innovation and ideas and compatible company cultures, but I don’t have the time or mental capacity to keep up with fifteen brands shouting at me everywhere I go. None of us do. </p>

<p>So, as an iwantmyname brand ambassador, I feel like the responsible thing to do is to help create a way to deliver our thoughts and innovations without filling people&#39;s lives with even more noise—to compress all the clutter into one manageable chunk. In 2015, I really think this is the best way to follow brands.</p>

<h3>Sign up for the monthly newsletter</h3>

<p>Most days we (along with so many other brands) publish blog posts, then do some connecting social posts—but it would be crazy to expect anyone to pay attention on a daily basis. If you follow the iwantmyname blog daily, as my mom would say, bless your heart. But let’s be honest…if you’re not a keeping up with the industry on a professional or semi-professional basis, you shouldn’t <em>have</em> to be thinking about domains all the time. We designed iwantmyname to be the simplest domain registrar on the internet because we <em>didn&#39;t</em> want people to have to regularly think about our end. </p>

<p>We do have some interesting ideas though, and we regularly highlight features and give suggestions that can make lives easier. For example, if you’re looking to host a podcast, we recently added <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/services/podcast/simplecast">Simplecast</a> to our available plugins. It’s a really neat platform—something we think you should know about. And we often post about new <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/new-gtld-domain-extensions">generic top-level domains (gTLDs)</a> coming out, which could inspire you to start the next great website. We’re also pretty big on startup culture, so we often write about new tools and thought technologies we find interesting.</p>

<p>So if you want some more of the above, or if you just want to know if our brand aligns with your ideals and priorities, the best/least-intrusive option is to <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/monthly">sign up for our newsletter</a>. Sure, it’s yet another thing  to sign up for, but in a way it sets you free. After you sign up, you can be certain we’ll deliver you our latest thoughts in one easily deletable email (seriously, one click and it’s gone), and after that, you can go back to thinking about whatever it is you should be thinking about—like your job, your family, or your hobby du jour.</p>

<p>Then, for more instant coverage, our social platforms (like <a href="https://twitter.com/iwantmyname">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iwantmyname">Facebook</a>) work great. Our general social strategy is to only spread thoughts—and very few good thoughts can be condensed to 140 characters—so 1-3 times a day we post links to blogs we’ve written, plus the occasional update, and that’s about it. If you see something you find interesting, click on it, but if you don’t, don&#39;t sweat it.</p>

<h3>Stats also seem to support a monthly newsletter</h3>

<p>I imagine it’s pretty clear by now that I prefer newsletters as the content driver for most brands, but the stats seem to support that thinking as well. If you’ve been an iwantmyname customer for a while, you’ve probably seen the yearly newsletter we send to remind people of our existence (we send it to every customer). Here are some stats from the end-of-2014 edition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sent to 99,960 mailboxes</li>
<li>29.2% open rate (vs. the 14.7 industry average, according to MailChimp)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most clicked items were:</p>

<ol>
<li>the link to subscribe to the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/monthly">new monthly newsletter</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/domains/special-offer">December domain discounts</a>, which tells me that a lot of the people interested in domain discounts aren’t regularly visiting our blog or site—which is perfectly understandable</li>
<li>the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ideegeo.com/forms/d/1WzXl1WdMt8eRoH1Kprl5QtRXmX-L4Citp9dYXvzTHUs/viewform">link to help</a> with the iwantmyname API</li>
</ol>

<p>I can’t say for certain that this is common for newsletters, but the analytics for this particular send seems to support the thinking that our customers would like a monthly edition, and that there are certain topics and tidbits people would like delivered to them on a semi-regular basis. That alone is reason enough to publish a monthly edition, so everything extra is gravy, as they say.</p>

<hr>

<h3>TLDR?</h3>

<p>Companies need monthly newsletters because people tend to appreciate news and ideas presented in unobtrusive, easily deletable packages. Brands are unique in that they have a ton of combined knowledge to share, but (I’m serious about this) customers shouldn’t have to spend more than 30 minutes a month to keep up with their latest thought technologies. If you want to follow a brand&#39;s blogs and social posts, that’s awesome, but you shouldn’t <em>have</em> to. </p>

<p>So, if you’d like to hear more from us (unobtrusively), be sure to subscribe to our new monthly newsletter, the <a href="https://iwantmyname.com/monthly">iwantmyname:Monthly</a>. We’ll be sending our first edition later on this week, and we think you’ll really like it (and if you don’t, just unsubscribe…<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB5ceAruYrI">hakuna matata</a>).</p>
